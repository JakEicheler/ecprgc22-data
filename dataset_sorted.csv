0,"As the world’s preeminent global governance institution, the United Nations (UN) has long been at the center of great power efforts to project global influence and co-shape world order. In recent years, China has visibly expanded its engagement in and with the UN. While scholarly attention has focused on how rising China engages the UN on human rights and security, academic discussions about China’s role in UN development work remain limited. It is against this backdrop that we focus on China’s expanding engagement across the UN development system. Based on insights from interviews, document analysis as well as quantitative data on funding and personnel, this paper examines how China’s position in development-related intergovernmental negotiations and its relationship with individual UN entities has evolved. As UN organizations and member states react to and position themselves towards China’s changing role, we ask whether and how these dynamics contribute to reshaping the geopolitical, institutional and normative dimensions of UN work. Conceptually rooted in International Relations thinking on power and global governance, the paper contributes to the growing literature on China’s role in multilateral organizations and debates about global power shifts in the international system.",German Institute of Development and Sustainability (IDOS),,,,,,,,German Institute of Development and Sustainability (IDOS),,Max-Otto Baumann,,,,,,,,Max-Otto Baumann,,China,Development,Governance,UN,Global,Power,,,China’s expanding engagement with the United Nations development system,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63364&EventID=185
0,"The designs of digital platforms for public authorities result from particular choices of communication models and the dominant definitions of problems in a democratic order. The deficit of deliberation on public issues and the insufficient citizens' involvement in decision-making are among major concerns in contemporary democracies. Following it, several multi-tools platforms for public consultations have been designed as some remedy in recent years. But, even if the majority of their applications are local, their users and designers meet with challenges of reconciling the goals of large-scale yet reciprocal and reflexive participation that is conclusive and may contribute to political decisions. While platforms' designers address similar problems, they sometimes differ in solution proposals, depending on the know-how, choices in the situation of trade-offs between values, or institutional contexts. 
In our comparative study of five platforms currently being used by public authorities to facilitate the organization of consultations with citizens, we aim to analyse alternative paths to scaling-up civic participation in connection to the standards of deliberation. Accordingly, we pose the following research questions: (1) What approaches and particular tools have the platform's designers adopted to encourage popular participation? (2) How have the platform's designers planned to deal with the mass participation that would respect the standards of inclusive, reflexive, and consequential deliberation process? (3) How do the institutional contexts and designers' motivations contribute to particular technology choices? To answer these questions, we have analysed features and tools of the platforms next to in-depth interviews with eight platforms' designers (from one to four per platform). We have developed a detailed framework for platforms' analysis, and the results have been discussed with designers to ensure their accuracy. 
All platforms are open-source, while institutions or organizations have managed them as commercial or non-commercial projects. Some support linear processes, whereas others do not require organizers to go through predefined stages. Behind the linear organization of the process, there is a salient assumption that a platform provides guidance to institutional users or even controls their actions to avoid omitting critical procedural elements. 
While some platforms aim at enlarging the scale of participation by synchronizing offline and online processes designed as mini-publics, others prime asynchronous, easy to access communication with the use of algorithms to increase the reciprocity and reflexivity of discussions. 
Although all platforms apply solutions to allow for more straightforward conclusions drawing from a large amount of text, these features, mainly using algorithms and machine learning, are under development. Only one platform provides the visualization of proposals and arguments based on the structuration of the participants' input at the cost of some constraints to the flow of communication.
It seems that if the platform is designed to operate on a large scale and for many different actors, it involves fewer process constraints but might require some compromise to deliberation.",University of Warsaw,University of Warsaw,,,,,,,University of Warsaw,,Anna Przybylska,Borys Tencer,,,,,,,Borys Tencer,,Comparative Politics,Cyber Politics,Democracy,Democratisation,Comparative Perspective,Decision Making,,,Choices and compromises in the public consultation platforms’ design.

0,"The third wave of the coronavirus pandemic coincided with the arrival and distribution of the first coronavirus vaccines for the member states of the European Union. However, while mass immunization in the EU progressed relatively rapidly from a global perspective, it lagged significantly behind Israel, the United Kingdom, or the United States, which resulted in considerable dissatisfaction among political actors and members of the general public, in particular in light of the rising number of cases as result of the unfolding third wave. Consequently, criticism of the EU administration and the procurement conditions soon emerged in several countries. In Hungary, the government also actively sought ways to increase the number of available vaccines by procuring two further vaccines (Sinopharm and Sputnik V) not approved by the European Medicines Agency. These vaccines got quickly labelled as ‘Eastern’ vaccines and became the objects of intense political debates. Governmental politicians and the pro-governmental media presented the delays in the EU’s vaccine procurement as yet another proof of the incompetence of the Brussels elite, while emphasized that without these ‘Eastern’ vaccines, the Hungarian vaccination program could not have progressed as quickly as it did. Contrastingly, most oppositional politicians questioned the safety and effectiveness of the ‘Eastern’ vaccines, and some even labelled their distribution as a ‘human experiment’.
Our research follows up these debates in the pro-governmental and the non-governmental media during the third wave of the pandemic between February and May 2021. We analyze the political and media discourses based on two pro-governmental (magyarnemzet.hu, pestisracok.hu) and two non-governmental (telex.hu, hang.hu) major online media sources. Our analysis contributes to the understanding of how specific policy issues can be dramatized and raised to a more general, normative level, in particularly during such emotionally highly intensive time periods as the coronavirus pandemic, as well as the ways specific policy issues can be framed along the ‘East-West’ and the ‘federal Europa – national sovereignty’ divides.",Corvinus University of Budapest,Corvinus University of Budapest,Corvinus University of Budapest,,,,,,Corvinus University of Budapest,,Akos Bocskor,Reka Tamassy,Anna Vancso,,,,,,Akos Bocskor,,Europe (Central and Eastern),European Union,Media,Social Media,Communication,Narratives,,,Choosing between the ‘East’ and the ‘West’: Media discourses about the ‘Eastern’ vaccines and ‘EU incompetence’ during the third wave of the coronavirus pandemic in Hungary,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65735&EventID=185
0,"Epistemic injustice exists when knowledge relevant to collective decisions goes unheard or gets discounted in ways that serve established hierarchy, and therefore inflicts wrongs upon the individuals or groups so disadvantaged. In Miranda Fricker’s (2007) classic statement, there are two kinds. Testimonial epistemic injustice occurs when prejudice leads relatively powerful people to dismiss considerations (such as arguments or testimonies) based on the social characteristics (such as class, race, or gender) of those advancing the considerations. Hermeneutical epistemic injustice is when the “collective interpretive resources” do not exist to make sense of oppression. We present an additional kind which we call chronic epistemic injustice, which can persist when the voiced considerations of the disadvantaged do get heard, and when relevant collective interpretive resources do exist. We define chronic epistemic injustice as a systematic misalignment between an individual or group’s subjective dispositions and what the individual or group expresses as its wants. Here, subjective dispositions cover values and beliefs, which in turn can draw upon collective interpretive resources.  We stress the collective character of interpretive resources, because (in keeping with epistemic arguments about democracy) different individuals may have access to different relevant bits of information, interpretation, and reasoning, which need combining. Wants for their part can be expressed in terms of preferences and can be revealed in behaviour such as voting. This kind of epistemic injustice is chronic because it can be demonstrated empirically to exist to a degree in every case we have examined. We believe it applies to many, most, or perhaps even all political issues most of the time, affecting many and perhaps most of the people engaging those issues. It is injustice because (as we will demonstrate empirically) individuals experience the misalignment to different degrees; and those who experience it most are, we find, likely to be disadvantaged on other dimensions. Finally we will show how chronic epistemic injustice can be overcome in deliberative settings, as well as through more demanding structural changes.

0,"Reaching ambitious GHG emission reduction goals at national and EU levels requires local action. Thus, the importance of cities and towns for climate governance has been recognized by the European Union and its member states. However, the embeddedness of local climate action in EU multilevel governance and the dependency on national energy and climate policy is often neglected. Thus, this paper discusses, first, the changes of local climate governance in the EU multilevel system because different instruments are needed for specific types of cities. Second, the paper provides an overview on the phases of EU-city relations from the emergence of transnational city networks to the establishment of the EU Covenant of Mayors and the development of the European Green Deal. Third, the paper focuses on the dynamics between leading and lagging cities in Europe. On this basis, the paper discusses the current challenges of local climate action in EU multilevel governance, in particular the need to develop appropriate governance capacities, to take the spatial dimension into account, and to upscale local experiments. Urban transformations in Europe require governance capacities for strategic, integrative, adaptive, and innovative actions. Moreover, there is a need to acknowledge the territorial dimensions of local climate action. Furthermore, scaling and scalability plays an essential role for the European Green Deal. Upscaling the experiences of forerunners implies that they can serve as models for other municipalities. Urban transformations towards climate-neutrality depend on the transfer potential of sectoral transitions and the cities’ capabilities to change underlying ideas and policy paradigms and thus develop unique transformation pathways.",Åbo Akademi,,,,,,,,Åbo Akademi,,Kristine Kern,,,,,,,,Kristine Kern,,Environmental Policy,European Union,Local Government,Climate Change,Energy Policy,,,,"Cities in EU multilevel climate policy:  governance capacities, territorial approaches, and upscaling local experiments",https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64639&EventID=185
0,"The local level is the favorite scale for the implementation of citizen participation.  Among all the subjects, urbanism has been one of the fields where it has developed the most. However, little research has been done at a metropolitan scale, that is, an analysis of citizen participation in multiple municipalities belonging to an urban agglomeration. The main purpose of this article is to know if the realisation of a participatory process in a metropolitan area has some specificities that enable us to differentiate it from a process at a local scale. To answer the question, we will use a case study methodology, analysing the participatory process of the Urban Director Plan of the Metropolitan Area of Barcelona. The results of the study indicate that in general, this process has reproduced the main gaps found in citizen participation processes at the local level, mainly gender imbalance. However, we have found that there is a higher participation of individual citizens, compared to that of associations, groups and platforms.",Universitat de Barcelona,Universitat de Barcelona,Universitat de Barcelona,,,,,,Universitat de Barcelona,,Lluís Medir,Mariona Tomas,Simona Sokolovska,,,,,,Lluís Medir,,Democracy,Local Government,Political Engagement,,,,,,Citizen participation at the metropolitan level: new experiences for old results?,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64215&EventID=185

However, evidence from twitter shows the Japanese government failed to establish an effective interaction with citizens during first wave of COVID-19. Combining methods such as sentiment analysis and LDA topic modeling, the results suggest that the government was insufficient to explain the policy and respond to public, the monologue of politicians and bureaucrats led to sustained negative emotion on internet. On the other hand, situation awareness with big data from internet show considerable timeliness and predictability during a pandemic. However, administrative responses to the COVID-19 were still mainly affected by elections and center-local political relations in Japan, which make it difficult to innovate the crisis management mechanism with new technologies. Furthermore, Japanese administrative responses to the COVID-19 during the first wave essentially blocked diversified participants and platforms including social media, which result in the inefficiency of the renowned disaster prevention administration system.",Fudan University,Hitotsubashi University,,,,,,,Fudan University,Hitotsubashi University,Xiaodong Zhang,Jiaqi Zheng,,,,,,,Xiaodong Zhang,Jiaqi Zheng,Asia,Social Media,Public Opinion,,,,,,Citizen-state interactions on social media during a pandemic: Lessons from Japan,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=62221&EventID=185
0,"Citizens’ participation has changed significantly over the past decades. The shift from traditional government to governance has resulted in the inclusion of new stakeholders into public decision-making. Initially, they were representatives of business and NGOs, and in recent years also the so-called hard-to-reach groups, including the elderly, people with disabilities, youth, and immigrants.
The experience of many local governments indicates at the same time that the involvement of so called hard-to-reach groups is not an easy and smooth process. Ones of these groups are undoubtedly children and youth. The situation seems to be motivated by two main reasons. On the one hand, the way of thinking about the involvement of youth, including the belief that they rather should be seen but not heard, constitutes a significant barrier. Against this background, a few issues are of importance. First, formalized, based mainly on representative democracy, decision-making assumes that the possibility for legitimate democratic participation should be attributed to people who possess certain features, e.g., age, experience, or specific types of knowledge. In this context, the political agency of children and youth is excluded from the realm of politics as their opinions are not considered politically relevant in adult terms (Bosco 2010; Häkli, Kallio 2018; Tisdall, Davis 2004). Second, what in a way results from the above is that young people are perceived as laypersons, without sufficient social and political background who are enabled to properly voice their own views (McKay 2014; Jankowiak 2017). This positions them as objects rather than subjects of policymaking, which can be exemplified by the fact that the majority of public authorities as well as non-governmental organizations work for children and young people rather than with children and young people. Consequently, inclusive governing is significantly limited. On the other hand, involving youngsters in governance requires a proper design of instruments and methods allowing for their actual incorporation into deciding. Here all the stages from searching for ideas, through implementation and evaluation of undertaken actions should be covered. This, however, creates important challenges for elected politicians, bureaucrats as well as adult citizens that often leads to a situation when participative agenda is built on pseudoforms of involvement, such as manipulation, decoration, or tokenism. In all of them, youngsters have no or very little control over what they do or how they participate (Hart 1992, 1997; see also Arnstein 1969).
The aim of the paper is to identify and analyze the forms of participation designed for children and youth in Poland and Finland. The article examines both instruments embedded in the law, such as youth councils as well as democratic innovations as for example youth participatory budgeting.

0,"The paper analyses how the local level democratic innovation of the City Council of Budapest worked and what impact it had on the participants’ attitudes. In September 2020 the first Hungarian Citizens’ Assembly on climate policy was organized by the new Mayor of Budapest (Oross-Mátyás-Gherghina, 2021). The success of the event was not evident, as citizens’ assemblies, citizens’ juries and other participatory democratic mechanisms have not been used in Hungarian governance. The past decade of illiberal politics led to reduced citizen activism and shrinking venues for policy participation (Majtényi et al, 2019; Hajnal and Boda, 2021). Moreover, environmental politics has been dismantled (Hungary is the only EU member state without a Ministry of Environment), public attitudes are materialistic, green values are weak (Mikecz, 2018). However, the Citizens’ Assembly was a success in terms of organization, outputs and the evaluation of the participants. The Assembly upheld radical green policy proposals with overwhelming majority – far beyond the findings of opinion polls. Also, green attitudes of the participants increased significantly (Oross, 2022). The analysis will seek to answer to the question to what extent are climate assembly had an impact on climate debate, policy and action? The impact of the events on climate debate will be analysed in the light of media appearances, the impact on policy will evaluate the recommendations of the assemblies from a comparative perspective while the impact on action will be discussed though survey data collected among participants of the Citizens’ Assembly in order to measure their attitudinal change.

0,"The legitimacy of a deliberative mini-public is not quantitative and aggregative, unlike elections or votes, but qualitative. In accordance with the theories of deliberative democracy, it is the quality of the procedures and the respect of democratic principles that matter. But do mini-public experiments really follow these theoretical imperatives? Are impartiality, fairness and equity really practiced in contemporary deliberative processes? This might be more difficult for citizens’ assemblies since they are the longest and most ambitious type of deliberative mini-publics, spanning over months or even years and invested with official mandates from political decision-making institutions. Furthermore, respecting impartiality could be even harder for climate assemblies, as climate policies are an “open problem” and not a binary or clear cut one.
In order to tackle this important issue, we conduct a qualitative analysis of the French Citizen’s Convention for Climate (CCC), based on a complete ethnographic direct observation of the whole process and dozens of in-depth semi-directive interviews with key actors (citizens, organizers, facilitators, experts, stakeholders). We will try to draw pragmatic and normative lessons from the procedural successes and failures of the CCC. Can we say, as the CCC co-chair did, that “neutrality is impossible”? But then what is a biased deliberation worth? Can it be considered legitimate? 
The objective of this paper is to identify criteria of legitimacy and procedural impartiality for the deliberation with the help of a fine ethnography of the Citizens’ Convention for Climate. We propose a framework for distinguishing legitimate from illegitimate interactions and influences within citizens’ assemblies. On the one hand, three criteria are highlighted and operationalized: pluralism, transparency, and fairness. On the other hand, we construct a typology of five “modes of influences” in a mini-public: procedural, classic, semi-formal, informal, and external.",Institut d'Études Politiques de Lille,Université de Lausanne,,,,,,,Université de Lausanne,,Simon Baeckelandt,Dimitri Courant,,,,,,,Dimitri Courant,,Citizenship,Democracy,Political Participation,Political Sociology,Qualitative,Climate Change,Empirical,Influence,Citizen’s Assemblies and the issue of impartiality.

0,"Urban areas account for 50% of the world’s population and Europe is one of the most urbanized continents in the world (Sawe, 2018). With cities being the epicenter of worldwide globalization processes and international decision-making, they also became home to some of the major contemporary economic and societal issues, among which the environmental crisis. Air pollution, in particular, poses some serious threats to the health of urban citizens, being responsible for more than 400,000 premature deaths in Europe each year (Schaefer, Kieslinger, and Fabian, 2020). Despite this, European countries still perform variously, as well as cities belonging to the same country. These results are affected by different factors, among which natural parameters, such as geographical positioning, but also by the robust or poor mitigation and adaptation strategies implemented.
This paper investigates to what extent proper policymaking can improve the performance of cities and, as a consequence, countries, in terms of AQ. It reflects on whether shared problems in the practice of pollution containment or, on the other hand, replicable successful strategies exist. The research, therefore, aims at understanding the conditions for either one or the other scenario and ultimately identifying practices among the city diplomatic activities to replicate across different environments, which could best support cities in the strive to reduce air pollution. The research question (RQ) around which the paper will build its reasonings and hypotheses is formulated as follows: How can city diplomacy contribute to tackling air pollution across European countries?
By investigating the relations between city diplomacy and air quality, the paper fills two literature gaps. Firstly, by associating city diplomacy and air quality, the research selects a specific environmental issue as potentially representative of other climate concerns, rather than applying city diplomacy to the broad concept of ‘greening’ and environmental protection. Research studies often focus on the general concepts of global warming and greenhouse gases (GHGs), which have indirect links to the sanitary status of individuals, while AQ is directly relatable to the health conditions of humans (Manisalidis et al., 2020) and therefore useful in drafting local policies. Nevertheless, this choice does not prevent the conclusion drafted by the analysis from being applied to other environmentally-specific issues. This is particularly relevant if it is considered that air pollution and climate change are scientifically deemed to be inextricably linked in terms of emission sources, climate characteristics, chemistry, and mitigation measures (Kumar, 2021).
Secondly, by conducting semi-structured interviews with city officials, this research investigates the prerequisites for cities to become diplomatically successful and overcome a specific climate-related issue, rather than on the potential of city diplomacy itself. In particular, this research categorizes cities’ prerequisites under three dimensions or hypotheses, mentioned as potentially impactful in the existing literature but not yet investigated: the connective role of cities between top-down and bottom-up AQ solutions, the network dimension, where bilateral and multilateral relations, allow cities to draft improved AQ mitigation measures, and the financial, where direct investments from multilateral banks and international private funds to cities can improve AQ diplomatic activities.",Vrije Universiteit Brussel,,,,,,,,Vrije Universiteit Brussel,,Gaia Guadagnini,,,,,,,,Gaia Guadagnini,,Environmental Policy,European Union,Local Government,Policy-Making,,,,,City Diplomacy for a renovated Air Quality policymaking across Europe.,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63271&EventID=185

By drawing from a recent (2020) Norwegian policy decision to give priority to LGBTIQ+ refugees in its refugee quota, the paper discusses some of the underlying rationales of such decision in light of recent theories of civic integration. In particular, I aim to show how the LGBTIQ+ prioritization policy can be seen to align with some of the much criticized aspects of civic integration as policies of, not integration, but migration control (on several levels, incl. first entry and family reunification). Furthermore, I discuss the ways in which the differences in the potential factors contributing to the integration success of LGBTIQ+ (contra non-LGBTIQ+) refugees feeds into our understandings of what successful integration of refugees (and other, non-refugee migrants) may require. While the paper develops a largely critical account of the LGBTIQ+ prioritization policy via the underlying rationales of civic integration, it also points towards an alternative basis for such selection that avoids many of the difficulties of the civic integration approach.",UiT – Norges Arktiske Universitet,,,,,,,,UiT – Norges Arktiske Universitet,,Annamari Vitikainen,,,,,,,,Annamari Vitikainen,,Citizenship,Democracy,Asylum,LGBTQI,,,,,Civic Integration and Refugee Selection,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64154&EventID=185
0,"Current arguments and strategies against democratic backsliding within some EU states have up until now focused on negative sanctions (e.g., financial conditionality, or restrictions of membership or political participation) or passive measures (dialogue and monitoring). This article presents and defends an unexplored positive measure that should be included in the set of strategies for EU member states resisting and/or reverting democratic backsliding. The measure consists in inviting individual members of democratically backsliding states to obtain the franchise, as well as other meaningfully related political rights and liberties in EU member countries committed to democracy. We argue that such an invitational measure is, in some respects, better suited to express EU states’ commitment to democracy than existing negative or passive measures, and connect the argument to current debates on the practical value of the right to vote. We consider the legal ramifications this invitational strategy, and contend that, far from undermining Art. 4 TEU principle of sincere cooperation and the definition of Union citizenship in Art. 10 TFEU, a properly circumscribed civic invitation scheme would be a coherent means to further cooperation and defend Union citizenship. Finally, we consider and reject two counter-arguments – the first based on the idea that civic invitation would constitute impermissible interference in the domestic affairs of another state, and the second that civic invitation could exacerbate backsliding by contributing to the exodus of people committed to liberal democracy from backsliding states (an analogue of the “brain drain” argument).","Departments of Political Science and Public Administration, Universiteit Leiden","Departments of Political Science and Public Administration, Universiteit Leiden",,,,,,,"Departments of Political Science and Public Administration, Universiteit Leiden",,Andrei Poama,Tom Theuns,,,,,,,Andrei Poama,,Democracy,European Union,Political Theory,Voting,,,,,Civic Invitation: Democratic Backsliding & Prodemocratic Partisanship in the EU,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64442&EventID=185
0,"The concept of monitory democracy has represented a successful paradigm in the democratic theory. However, the concept of political monitoring has seldom entered the study of collective action. This gap is even more pressing today since the pandemic has clearly shown the necessity and potentialities of such a form of democratic participation. To start addressing this discussion, the present paper aims at investigating practices of civic monitoring, conceptualized as a paramount case of hybridization between social movements and civil society forms of action and their pro-democratic consequences. In doing so, it firstly discusses the democratic value of forms of organized distrust in collective action, introducing the concept of societal accountability. Moving from a theoretical discussion of the concept of civic monitoring, the paper offers a reflection on the interaction between movements and civil society actors in practices of control and oversight of powerholders. Given the vast array of actors populating the monitoring field, one should expect to find different strategies when it comes to oversight and control institutional power. In this sense, the expectation is that monitoring activities are characterized by the co-existence of different strategies and repertoires, as maintained by the hybridization thesis. Lastly, it advances a relational approach to investigate the consequences of monitoring practices, combining forms of integration (horizontal vs vertical) and modes of coordination (social movements, coalitions, communities, and organizations). This approach is in line with a relational and non-aggregative understanding of collective action, which dismantles the well-entrenched idea that associates social movements with the use of specific repertoires of action. On the contrary, relational accounts of collective action focus on patterns of interaction to differentiate among forms of civic engagement. Internal differences are thus determined by modes of coordination, namely on relational patterns characterizing the interaction between and within civic actors. Drawing from case studies coming from the Italian and Spanish accountability contexts, the paper maintains that practices of civic monitoring represent a perfect example of hybridization of the civic sphere at the level of practices. The analysis of the empirical material let emerge the co-occurrence of four different types of civic monitoring: 1. Monitoring Campaigns, 2. Communities, 3. Shared Monitoring, 4. Disclosure Monitoring. It also maintains that their consequences are better understood when considering the relational structure and strategies through which these practices unfold.",Scuola Normale Superiore,,,,,,,,Scuola Normale Superiore,,Alessandra Lo Piccolo,,,,,,,,Alessandra Lo Piccolo,,Civil Society,Democracy,Political Participation,Political Sociology,Mobilisation,Activism,,,Civic Monitoring: Hybrid Practices of Democratic Participation in Italy and Spain,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65308&EventID=185
0,"To what extent does participation in the policy process transform civil society and how does civil society respond to, and influence public policies? 
This question has increasingly gained salience in the European Union (EU)’s neighbourhood as a result of both domestic and external pressure, including local demands for accountability and EU shift towards a “partnership with societies”. However, due to the restrictive conceptualisation of CSOs as instruments of EU-level actors in much of the governance-oriented literature, we miss a truly bottom-up perspective that would take into account CSOs as actors in their own right. 
In order to bridge this analytical gap, we build on the governmentality perspective, which focuses on power and micro-practices and enables us to dig deeper by unearthing power relations in governance structures in a Foucauldian “archaeology of power” tradition (Burchell et al. 1991). Drawing on critical scholarship, we conceptualise what participation in the policy process does to civil society actors in the EU’s neighbourhood. We also study how hybrid regimes use civil society as part of their own legitimation strategies and how civil society actors respond to such challenges. Empirically, we offer a comparative analysis based upon empirical data on CSOs participation in four eastern and southern ENP countries, gathered as part of an international research project (INTEND, ANR-FWF).",Freie Universität Berlin,Université Sorbonne Nouvelle,,,,,,,Freie Universität Berlin,,Aron Buzogany,Laure Delcour,,,,,,,Aron Buzogany,,Civil Society,European Union,Interest Groups,Critical Theory,Comparative Perspective,Policy-Making,,,Civil society and participation in the EU’s neighbourhood: Towards a bottom-up approach,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64401&EventID=185

0,"Policy actors are a central element in policy making and many classic and contemporary policy theories stress and investigate their importance. Policy actors are usually classified onto state / institutional / official actors and nonstate / noninstitutional / unofficial actors, with several subtypes within each. Then the features of actors are analysed, their power, resources, skills, strategies, perspectives, ideas, etc., to get more precise insight into their influence onto policy making. Finally, research is devoted to the relationships among actors and the structure of those relations in the form of triangles, networks, coalitions, or communities. Even though actors are a major issue in policy process research, there is still a lack of knowledge on how policy actors affect policy making. The roles different types of actors, with different features and relationships, take in the agenda-setting, policy design, and implementation are one of the weakest parts of the discipline. Concept of policy entrepreneurs is a good exception (Kingdon, 1984, Petridou, Mintrop, 2020), but what other heterogeneous roles policy actors perform in policy making? There is no systematic classification of all the roles actors can fulfil within policy transformations. 

This is where this paper will try to contribute by conducting an empirical investigation on diverse variants of policy actor’s roles, with descriptive purpose and a descriptive research question. It will be founded on the cross-sectoral comparison of Croatian public policies, that represent diverse policy areas (from defence and foreign affairs, law and order, economic, social, sectoral, and other policies, see Compston, ed, 2004). Data gathering will be done through expert interviews with Croatian scholars from different disciplines, that are devoted to studies of specific sectors.

0,"Climate assemblies (CAs) are being increasingly used to engage citizens in climate change policy making throughout Europe. Consequently, their design and operation are focused on optimising their influence on politicians, governments, and policymakers. Much less emphasis is placed on how and to what extent CAs influence the wider public. However, public awareness of and support for CAs could stimulate public debate about climate change action and possibly change attitudes too. This could also increase pressure on decision-makers to act on an assembly’s recommendations, improving their influence on climate change policymaking. We assess this through an analysis of two UK cases. The publicity budgets for Climate Assembly UK (CAUK) and Scotland’s Climate Assembly (SCA) were relatively higher than previous mini-publics, with dedicated mainstream and social media campaigns, however, public awareness of both these CAs remained low. Using the results of population surveys this study provides intersectional analysis of public awareness of, and attitudes to, CAs. Using the results of surveys of the participants of each assembly, we compare public views with those of the assembly members to consider how participation in CAs affects attitudes to the process. There have been calls to increase resources for publicising CAs. The results of this study could aid how these resources could be allocated for future CAs to realise the benefits of increased public knowledge and awareness.",Scottish Government,Newcastle University,Newcastle University,,,,,,Newcastle University,,Nadine Andrews,Jayne Carrick,Stephen Elstub,,,,,,Stephen Elstub,,Democracy,Governance,Green Politics,Media,Political Participation,Climate Change,Political Engagement,,Climate Assemblies and Public Debate and Opinion: An Analysis of UK Cases,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64011&EventID=185
0,"Over the last decades, the rise of the far right and populist movements in Europe and its resulting impact on liberal democracies and party politics have been subject to a vivid debate among researchers. In addition, researches, the public and politics intensively discussed the current environmental crisis (air and water pollution, climate change, etc.). While both subjects have been analyzed on their own, this study focuses on their nexus. Existing research highlights that many right-wing populist parties (RWPs) show in one way or another denial towards (anthropogenic) climate change. To understand this denial and its possible impact on climate change mitigation, I analyze how RWPs of Germany, Spain, and Austria frame the issue of climate change in their communication. Secondly, research agrees that in particular the mainstream parties (mostly the big parties left and right of the political center) influence the public and therefore it is central to understand possible (inter)relations of RWPs and mainstream parties in the climate change discourse. Thus, the second part of this research project concentrated on the development of the concept of climate change in the communication of mainstream parties.
In a first step, drawing on the methodological apparatus of the discourse-historical approach in critical discourse studies, I study how, when and in which context RWPs use the climate change discourse. In a second step, in the light of the literature on party competition and applying a discourse conceptual analysis, I examine possible correlations of a climate change-skeptical communication of RWPs and a possible change of the climate change discourse of established parties right and left of the political center.
This analysis will center on the development of discourses in the context of climate issues over a longer period of time. Specifically, I will compare various documents (social media posts, press releases, parliamentary debates, policy documents) over time to study climate change discourses of various political parties in three European countries. The focus lies on the communication towards the public, thus on their Facebook and Twitter posts, as well as on their press releases or party outlets. The time span of the analysis ranges between 2016 and 2020, after RWPs gained power in various EU member states and the issue of climate change has become very salient in European media and politics.
Results show that the national relevant RWPs increase their social media communication on climate change when its salience in society increases. Moreover, RWPs typically deny anthropogenic climate change and expresses concern about climate protection policies. Furthermore, the analysis reveals whether established parties show a discourse shift in their communication and their framing of climate change after RWPs take up the issue and express denial towards climate change and corresponding policies. This research project shows how important it is to investigate certain actors and their communication towards the public as well as to understand the processes and possible relations behind them to comprehend and influence policy framing and decision-making processes.",European Academy of Bolzano,,,,,,,,European Academy of Bolzano,,Mirjam Gruber,,,,,,,,Mirjam Gruber,,Political Parties,Populism,Social Media,Climate Change,Communication,Comparative Perspective,,,Climate change communication in a time of populism.,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65022&EventID=185
0,"The National Climate Protection Initiative (NKI) in Germany provides a strong external incentive for municipalities and districts to develop local climate mitigation strategies and to become climate labs with their own climate change mitigation management. Yet, the latest evaluation of the NKI confirms that there is a great disparity in the distribution of funding across the regions. Taking this regional fragmentation across regional climate mitigation management in Germany as a starting point, we explore climate change mitigation management across local governments, identifying characteristic features and asking: How can we explain disparity in the amount of funding for climate mitigation management across districts?
In order to answer the research question, we draw on climate policy literature pointing to the role of socio-economic and institutional determinants rather than the role of actors. Accordingly, using data from the German Federal Ministry for the Environment on climate funding in the context of the NKI, we study 400 cities and districts to systematically test hypotheses concerning the disparity in the likelihood of urban versus rural areas to apply for climate funding, as well as the amount they receive. Further, we take socio-economic data from the regional statistics offices, Eurostats, the umbrella organization of the district parliaments, and the websites of the city parliaments. With multilevel ordinary least squares (OLS) and logistic regression, we show that in most districts there is still no climate protection management in place despite Germany’s climate protection goals and funding scheme. Our analysis indicates that the existence and quality of the climate management correlates with the level of urbanisation in a district, whereas structural or partisan factors seem to have less influence. We argue that despite an increasing number of local climate labs, there is important unused potential for climate mitigation in districts. In order to tap into these potentials, we propose a new research agenda focusing on climate mitigation in rural areas.",Otto-von-Guericke University Magdeburg,Universität Bern,Würzburg Julius-Maximilians University,,,,,,Würzburg Julius-Maximilians University,,Michael Böcher,Marlene Kammerer,Ulrike Zeigermann,,,,,,Ulrike Zeigermann,,Environmental Policy,Green Politics,Local Government,Regionalism,Climate Change,,,,Climate labs versus unused potentials: Examining the rural-urban divide in local climate mitigation,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65213&EventID=185
0,"Policy integration is widely recognized as crucial to governing of societal challenges cutting across a wide array of societal sectors, such as climate change. In this paper, we develop a new and more nuanced understanding of how climate policy integration may work in sector-specific decision-making procedures. Combining a processual understanding of climate policy integration, with the institutional logics tradition within neo-institutionalism, this paper develops a concept that enable us to analytically capture and understand a broad array of integrative efforts. Integrating climate policy within the agricultural sector has been deemed crucial by both policymakers and researchers, but such integration is not straightforward. This paper specifies three different ideal models of climate policy integration in the agricultural sector: multifunctional, market failure and net-zero. Empirically, the paper finds a remarkable shift in models over time in climate policy integration within Norwegian agricultural policy, from 2006 to 2021. The multifunctional model dominated for many years, although the governmental actors also eventually came to promote a market failure understanding of climate policy integration. Eventually, a net-zero understanding was introduced by the Norwegian government, but the agricultural organizations continued to promote a multifunctional model of integration.",CICERO,,,,,,,,CICERO,,Katrine Skagen,,,,,,,,Katrine Skagen,,Institutions,Climate Change,Policy Change,Policy Implementation,Empirical,,,,Climate Policy Integration in Agriculture: From a multi-functional to a net-zero in Norwegian support negotiations.,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65780&EventID=185
0,"Populism research increasingly emphasizes the relationship between populism, climate change, and climate policy, and the political tensions between populist politicization and technocratic de-politicization of climate change. The impacts of right-wing populist’s impact on climate policies has received particular attention. In the US case, while the presidency of Donald Trump received tremendous attention in general, it also represented a culmination of the development in the Republican Party, for which climate skepticism has meanwhile become a major policy platform. At the same time, there has been growing interest in political and social sciences on the possibility of an emerging left-wing populism, though only slightly in connection with climate policy. However, especially recent developments precisely in the US case invite a closer inspection of the emergence and possibilities of a left-wing climate populism. This paper explores the relationship between left-wing populism and climate policy. To this end, it briefly recapitulates the basic characteristics of populism and its left-wing variants. Secondly, it examines plausible left-wing populist linkages to climate change mitigation as well as possible contradictions (such as the tension between populist producerism and ecological austerity). The main section investigates current political approaches to climate change and their significance for left-wing populism based on recent cases in the United States and the Green New Deal in particular. Finally, the paper discusses whether climate change could be a solid platform for left-wing populism at all, and whether the US case provides indications of an emerging left-wing climate populism and how far it is likely to be transferrable to other contexts.",Technische Universität Darmstadt,RWTH Aachen University,Technische Universität Darmstadt,,,,,,Technische Universität Darmstadt,,Jörg Kemmerzell,Jared Sonnicksen,Veith Selk,,,,,,Veith Selk,,Civil Society,Populism,Social Movements,USA,Climate Change,Activism,,,Climate Populism on the Left?

0,"The contribution of this article is an examination of the policy fault-lines within a climate risk discourse that make a riskification process possible at the local level. Securitization theory is used to analyze the case, and in particular the parts of securitization theory that address riskification. The case study analyzed in this paper shows that the framing used widens the scope of legitimate actors that takes part in the climate risk management at the local level in comparison to climate change adaptation. New actors such as the industry and business department within the municipality is included. At the same time, the issue becomes one of consequences of potential events and related uncertainties because that is how risk is conceptualized and characterized. The uncertainties are those of what the future climate locally will be, and if the consequences will occur in the climate scenario. The course to reduce uncertainties is to increase knowledge about the local effects of climate change. This is done by bringing in scientific communities to estimate for example future torrential rain patterns and sea level maximum height in different sea states. In addition to knowledge, tools to manage and govern the risk are vital components of the solution. Hence, while the number of actors involved in climate risk handling is widening, the way the issue can be spoken about, and the potential solutions narrow. This indicates a step away from normal governance of an issue where multiple views are acceptable and legitimate.",University of Stavanger,,,,,,,,University of Stavanger,,Cathrine Witnes Karlson,,,,,,,,Cathrine Witnes Karlson,,Governance,Local Government,Climate Change,,,,,,Climate risk management and riskification at the local level – a case study of Stavanger Municipality,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63397&EventID=185
0,"The 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) lie at the heart of global sustainability. While the achievement of the goals is considered an indivisible whole, evidence suggests they are neither integrated nor jointly implemented. Among them, SDG1 aims to end global poverty with 7 underlying targets and 13 indicators. At the same time, efforts to tackle climate change have significantly increased over the past years, but a global response accelerating transition, integrating climate action into the broader sustainability agenda is still missing. Consequently, attention has been paid to how the two agendas can be governed in an integrated way through institutional interlinkages in multi-level political settings. The coherent governance of synergies and trade-offs between the two agendas clearly has transformative potential. However, even despite their interconnectedness, SDGs are still implemented in siloes, meaning that policy-making almost exclusively focuses on one sector or policy subfield and there has been little inter-sectoral and inter-institutional cooperation to date. 
Institutional interlinkages and interactions between the social, environmental and economic objectives of the SDGs are especially pressing in Sub-Saharan African countries with populations vulnerable to both poverty and climate impacts. The lack of synergistic integration in sustainability governance potentially hinders broad societal transformation especially in the climate-poverty nexus. On the one hand, climate efforts not aligned to poverty eradication policies may be maladaptive, potentially worsening poverty and leading to less effective responses to climate change. On the other hand, pro-poor strategies that are based on carbon-intensive economic growth will amplify climate change. Synergistic governance of the climate-poverty nexus is therefore of key importance; however, we know surprisingly little about how trade-offs can be transformed to synergies in a global South context. 
This paper offers a systematic meta-analytical review, exploring existing literature on interlinkages, trade-offs and synergies in Sub-Saharan African countries, with a specific focus on the climate-poverty nexus. The paper asks the following questions: i) how can synergies and trade-offs be identified in a cross-sectoral multi-level setting, ii) what do we know about the interconnectedness of actors and institutions in the climate-poverty nexus; precisely what is the nature of these interlinkages across sectors and scales in Sub-Saharan Africa, and most importantly, iii) whether and how synergies contribute to broader societal transformations, specifically how climate commitments support or hinder poverty eradication under the 2030 Agenda.

In more general terms, the paper makes a significant contribution to advance the field of SDG interlinkages by arguing that synergies and trade-offs between policy subfields are crucial in addressing pressing global challenges in the intersecting fields of climate action and sustainable development. Additionally, the paper investigates how the synergistic governance of interlinkages may have a catalytic societal transformative potential in a global South context - establishing the integrated, indivisible whole of the SDGs that the 2030 Agenda calls for.",Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam,,,,,,,,Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam,,Eszter Szedlacsek,,,,,,,,Eszter Szedlacsek,,Africa,Development,Environmental Policy,Governance,Integration,Developing World Politics,Climate Change,Policy-Making,"Climate-poverty nexus in Sub-Saharan Africa: the transformative potential of governing SDG interlinkages, synergies and trade-offs",https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65271&EventID=185
0,"Consociational democracies rely on a system of power-sharing between groups to manage ethnic conflict and nationalist strife. Elections by proportional representation allow ethnic groups to be represented by their respective elites (Lijphart 1977; McGarry & O’Leary 1993; Norris 2008). By creating a direct electoral link between ethnic group members and their representatives, each representative is institutionally incentivized to represent their co-ethnic group members’ interests. In other words, consociationalism is premised on the assumption of co-ethnic group representation.

However, even though Lijphart’s consociational theory is over 50 years old, hitherto little is known about the process of political representation of ethnic groups in deeply divided societies. Much research has focused on the institutional features of consociationalism with a particular emphasis on federalism, but much less effort has been devoted to understanding the process of ethnic group representation, and in particular the link between the descriptive and substantive representation of ethnic groups. Hence, the extant research has not yet tested the hypothesis that members of ethnic groups behave as substantive representatives of their co-ethnic group interests.

To test this hypothesis, we study the process of representative claim-making (Saward 2010) on behalf of ethno-linguistic groups in the Brussels Capital region of Belgium. The Brussels region is divided into two official language groups, Dutch and French speakers, and the Brussels Parliament has proportionately reserved seats for Dutch- and French-speaking MPs (Deschouwer 2012; Janssens 2018). However, the Brussels case is particularly interesting because Brussels voters can hold MPs from the other ethno-linguistic group electorally accountable. Contrary to the rest of Belgium, where voters can only support parties and candidates belonging to the same ethno-linguistic group, cross-ethnic voting is possible and does occur in Brussels (Blanckaert, Caluwaerts & Erzeel 2021). Hence, while we would expect co-ethnic claim-making to be the norm in Brussels, at least some MPs receive electoral incentives to make representative claims on behalf of the other ethno-linguistic group (i.e. cross-ethnic claim-making), or make claims transcending the particular interests of either ethnolinguistic group (i.e. non-ethnic overarching claim-making). 

An exploratory claim-making analysis of parliamentary questions between 2009 and 2019 in the Brussels Parliament will reveal (1) to what extent Brussels MPs engage in co-ethnic, cross-ethnic or overarching claim-making, and (2) how this varies according to the partisan and ethno-linguistic identities of the MPs as well as the incentives they receive from the electoral and institutional context.",Vrije Universiteit Brussel,Vrije Universiteit Brussel,Vrije Universiteit Brussel,,,,,,Vrije Universiteit Brussel,,Benjamin Blanckaert,Didier Caluwaerts,Silvia Erzeel,,,,,,Benjamin Blanckaert,,Ethnic Conflict,Parliaments,Representation,Empirical,,,,,"Co-ethnic, cross-ethnic or non-ethnic overarching claims?

0,"In the wake of the global sustainability agenda implementation, collaborative sustainability research has been actively endorsed at many institutional levels. Co-production of research and action, transdisciplinarity and actionable science have been incentivised and heavily invested in - seen as an ‘epistemic imperative’ for the politics of sustainability. However, neither sustainability nor collaborative research are sedimented phenomena; they are both infused with conflictual interpretations and take diverse conceptual and practical forms along the political and scientific spectra. Furthermore, the logics by which ‘knowledge’ and ‘action’ come together vary widely across disciplinary perspectives, contexts and actors. Evidence suggests that these conflicts between interpretations, logics and practices, if not acknowledged, potentially hinder the contribution of collaboration processes to ’sustainabilities’. However, there is also evidence that, if acknowledged and understood, these conflicts can promote reflexive sustainability governance by opening up political processes at various levels and creating spaces for change. 
This article examines the logics linking knowledge and action employed by sustainability research financiers, and what kinds of collaborative sustainability research they potentially enable. Empirically, the article engages in two levels of sense-making analysis. First, it analyses four Swedish public research financiers’ interpretations of the overarching sustainability and collaborative research imaginaries reflected in the respective national policies, and how these interpretations shape the financiers’ research funding profiles and research calls. Second, it looks at how the research community responds to these calls and fills them with meaning. The article draws conclusions on what implications the existing logics and practices of public research funding may have for the contributions of collaborative sustainability research towards ‘sustainabilities’.",Södertörn University,,,,,,,,Södertörn University,,Tatyana Sokolova,,,,,,,,Tatyana Sokolova,,Environmental Policy,Governance,Institutions,Knowledge,Narratives,,,,Co-producing ‘the future(s) we want’: Political imaginaries and conflicting logics of linking knowledge and action in collaborative sustainability research policy,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63875&EventID=185
0,"Recent studies have found that voters use coalition heuristics to make inferences about party positions. When parties cooperate, they are perceived as closer together in an ideological space than when they compete. So far, this mechanism has only been tested at the national level and researchers have largely disregarded the complex interaction between parties competing and cooperating at various levels of a federal state. A German citizen is continuously exposed to different coalitions in her own state, in neighbouring states, and at the federal level. In this paper we argue that this complex multi-level system should have an influence on the perception of voters, especially for coalition parties. More specifically, we hypothesize that voters will perceive those national parties as closer to each other on a left-right scale that are in government in their state even though they are not members of the same coalition at the national level. We test our hypothesis by relying on the GLES 2016-2020 panel study. By doing so, we will not only analyse how regional government participation influences the perception of parties at the national level but also test what kind of consequences change in government participation at the regional level has for this perception.

0,"Scholars offers two competing explanations for the use of economic sanctions – instrumental and symbolic. In respect to the former, the motivation for the use of economic sanctions stems from the desire of policy makers to change the behaviour of a target state. However, given the low effectiveness of economic sanctions, literature has suggested that economic sanctions are in fact imposed to address the expectations of the domestic audience and, consequently, the motivation is symbolic. In this article, I assess this argument and study whether a political leader experiences a domestic audience boost for imposition of economic sanctions. Unlike other studies, I also test whether multilateral efforts offer an additional increase in popularity and, following crisis bargaining literature, whether issuing an empty threat results in a domestic audience cost. To address these questions, I employ a difference-in-differences design and study the change in the approval rating of US presidents.

0,"The paper explores, for a theoretical/ conceptual perspective, a relatively new phenomenon, known in the community of research and practice as “influence operations”, “information warfare”, “computational propaganda”, “disinformation 2.0”, or “cognitive warfare”. We premise our conceptual work on the ideas that the new threats to the integrity of public discourse in liberal democracies emerge in a completely changed communication and information environment, driven by the technological factor (explosion of social media/ digital platforms), and the geopolitical factor (interconnectedness of the global information space, and loss of monopoly over the global information space from Western actors). The aims of the paper are to compare and discuss existing conceptualizations of this phenomenon, to provide arguments in favor of the idea that the term “cognitive warfare” best describes the consubstantiality between contemporary propaganda efforts and the new technological eco-system and to propose a working conceptual framework for researchers, policy-makers and practitioners alike. We show that cognitive warfare is a continuous, at-peace battle over the human mind, integrating cyber, information, psychological, and social engineering capabilities. Thanks to technological possibilities, it may target influential individuals/ decision-makers, specific groups, and large numbers of people, selectively or serially. Its final goal is to polarize, disrupt and strategically shape public discourse so as to kill the very possibility of debate and to render the opponent ungovernable.

0,"Global governance structures are increasingly described as highly complex, fragmented, and polycentric. In many issue areas, the creation, design, and effectiveness of different types of global governance institutions are fundamentally shaped by how these institutions interact with other institutions operating in their domain. Despite this increasing importance of inter-institutional interactions for the life of individual global governance institutions, we still know little about how different institutions are interconnected and what factors help to explain variation in patterns of interactions. In this paper, I contribute to closing this research gap. Based on a new dataset of 55 intergovernmental organizations (IGOs) between 2009 and 2020 and a typology of inter-institutional collaboration that identifies different types of cooperative interactions among IGOs (e.g. information sharing, co-financing, and partnerships), I map inter-institutional collaboration across issue areas and over time.

0,"Studies of policy processes in higher education show how implementation processes are neither linear nor rational, often instead marked by unintended and ambiguous results (Gornitzka, Kogan, & Amaral, 2005). This is not unique to higher education, classic studies on implementation show how any reform implementation usually involves interpretation and discretion on ‘shop floor’ level. At the same time, governments are in a perpetual search for ‘what works’ in governance arrangements, to contribute to more effective steering that can deliver intended results. One means is to a larger extent involve the stakeholders and sector in reform development and governance processes, expecting that this would strengthen legitimacy and reduce implementation costs, an approach that has been labelled as ‘collaborative governance’. Collaborative governance implies involvement of stakeholders in formal, consensus-oriented decision-making processes concerning policy development or implementation (Ansell & Gash, 2008, p. 544). In this paper, focus is on examining how such collaborative approaches may be employed in the context of higher education, the dilemmas that emerge in design process, and the potential consequences this has for policy outcomes. 
The empirical setting in this paper is the introduction of multi-annual performance agreements in higher education in Norway. These contracts were introduced through a three-stage pilot from 2016 and onwards. Dialogue and consensus-orientation between stakeholders has been an important characteristic of higher education policymaking in Norway (Bleiklie & Michelsen, 2012), yet the pilot concerning the development of the contracts introduced a number of new ideas, as the representatives from the sector were involved as co-constructors of the performance agreements as new governance instrument. The analysis highlights the consequences of temporal sequencing of the development process into three stages, the varying and rather consequential effects of the very open-ended approach from the ministry, the interaction of the new governance instrument with existing instrument ‘mix’, and the role of various other concurrent developments. As such, the analysis points out a number of dilemmas, both around the introduction of performance agreements, as well as those inherent in using collaborative design and implementation approaches in higher education policymaking.","Nordic Institute for Studies in Innovation, Research and Education",,,,,,,,"Nordic Institute for Studies in Innovation, Research and Education",,Mari Elken,,,,,,,,Mari Elken,,Governance,Higher Education,Policy Implementation,Policy-Making,,,,,Collaborative design of governance instruments in higher education,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63942&EventID=185
0,"How can international organizations without substantial bureaucratic structures gain collective agency and independence from their member states? In contrast to full-fledged international organizations, horizontal regulatory organizations (HROs) in global environmental and financial politics lack extensive bureaucracies and are dominated by their (state and non-state) members. Examples include the Basel Committee of Banking Supervision (BCBS) or the Convention on Biodiversity (CBD). Despite their horizontal design, these organizations display varying degrees of collective agency that cannot be reduced to individual activities of their member. We argue that specialization in otherwise horizontal IOs generates organizational autonomy even without large bureaucratic structures. To support this argument, we first outline a concept that elucidates the origins of organizational agency in the absence of delegation to administrations. We argue that organizations gain agency, if they are authorized to make governance decisions, such as regulation, and if they acquire some autonomy (develop a specific organizational rationale). Second, we develop causal mechanisms showing how, and under which conditions, horizontal organizations can gain autonomy through functional differentiation and specialized organizational bodies, despite close control by their members. Third, we introduce a new dataset for the empirical assessment of the presence of decision-making authority and autonomy-generating institutional arrangements for 40 horizontal organizations in environmental protection and financial market regulation.",University of Bamberg,University of Bamberg,Freie Universität Berlin,Freie Universität Berlin,,,,,University of Bamberg,Freie Universität Berlin,Michael Giesen,Thomas Gehring,Simon Linder,Thomas Rixen,,,,,Michael Giesen,Thomas Rixen,Environmental Policy,Governance,Institutions,Political Economy,Global,International,Climate Change,Differentiation,Collective Agency of Horizontal Organizations: Specialization as an Institutional Source in Global Environmental and Financial Market Governance,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63448&EventID=185

Compared to the status quo ante, regressive developments signal a loss of democratic quality, which is why they seem puzzling from a normative point of view – especially in countries in which liberal democracy is a hard-won achievement after a history of manifest injustice. One way to make sense of regressive developments is to look at them from the perspective of the historical self-understanding of overcoming injustice. With David Art (2006), we can distinguish ""cultures of victimization"" from ""cultures of contrition"", but this distinction has so far only been applied to the politics of memory of domestic injustice, not to the legacy of the colonial past. Similarly, M. Rainer Lepsius proposed to look at ""internalising"" and ""externalising"" strategies in the politics of memory.

0,"Most countries in this world have stood in a colonial relation with other countries at some point. Colonialism involves political and economic domination over a dependent territory and was internationally legitimated by a supposed entitlement to conquer and control on the basis of racial or civilizational superiority. In fact, European constitutional states developed within systems of colonial law from the beginning. These states had the power to shape a global migration regime to further their own interests which continue even today. However, the discussion of immigration ethics has mainly focused on global distributive justice. Advocates for open borders often justify international mobility rights by appealing to some distributive standards, such as global equality of opportunity or mere sufficiency. Relatively sparse attention has been paid to the implications of global ractificatory justice for immigration policy. Reference to past injustice can supplement arguments for global distributive justice by providing additional justification for condemning present injustices. Equally important, the continued non-rectification of colonial injustices constitutes an essential part of the present distributive injustice at the global level. In this paper I argue that former colonial states have a reparative duty to extend the option of full membership to the current members of former colonized communities living outside their borders. 
The duty to include is grounded on the collective duty on the part of the former colonial states to make amends for the historic injustices caused by colonialism and for the continuing non-rectification of such injustices. There are other possible measures of reparations. However, the duty to include is one appropriate response to colonial injustices as it tracks a distinctive wrong of colonialism—that is the creation and imposition of political association that denies members equal and reciprocal terms of cooperation. Not only have the former colonial states failed to rectify the harms of colonialism, they also failed to meet their associative duties, including robust distributive duties to share fairly the benefits deriving from their political association with the colonized peoples, which obtained during the colonial period. Dramatic inequalities among different societies, which are shaped by a shared history of colonial domination and exploitation, make citizenship a significant determinant of a person’s life chances. On the one hand, there is substantial empirical evidence indicating that migration is effective at reducing global poverty for the migrants themselves and the sending countries. On the other, Western affluent states often exploit the unjust disadvantages facing the former colonized peoples to to “cherry pick” potential migrants. In addition, the offer of full membership from the former colonial states tend to take seriously the agency of the current members of formerly colonized communities.

In the context of West European and North American democratic societies, the questions of how crisis-related expert knowledge is produced and communicated have been studied extensively. However, we still know exceptionally little about the origins and contents of such knowledge, its communication channels, and effects in non-democratic political environments. This study addresses this gap by focusing on a specific group of expert knowledge producers and communicators, namely Russian think tanks established under the auspices of the presidential administration and the government. Centered on Russia as a case of consolidated autocracy, the paper compares state-linked think tanks’ discursive responses to two protracted crises with different degrees of salience in the Russian public space: the Covid-19 pandemic and the climate change crisis. The study specifically examines what kind of messages state-linked think tanks try to convey to policymakers and to the public; what strategies and channels they use to communicate these messages to their audiences; and whether different channels are used to convey different information. 
Methodologically, the paper employs semi-structured expert interviews with selected think tankers and a subsequent content analysis of these interviews as well as of publications available on the think tanks’ websites. The interviews are used to reveal the think tanks’ communication channels and strategies as well as messages they are trying to convey to policy-makers in the non-public domain of their activities. The content analysis serves for identifying discursive frames used by think tankers to emphasize different dimensions of the Covid-19 and the climate crises. To “capture” the crisis frames, the study operationalizes them as the combination of four elements, suggested by Entman (1993): problem definition, causal interpretation, moral evaluation, and response recommendation.
Preliminary findings suggest that there is a considerable variance in how think tanks discursively approach the Covid-19 and the climate crises. In some cases, Russian state-linked think tanks have openly endorsed national authorities’ crisis response and discursively normalized the critical situation in Russia, while overemphasizing problematic developments elsewhere in the world and thus shifting attention in the public discourse away from domestic emergencies. In others, think tankers attempted objective analyses of the pandemic and climate change, concentrating more on the domestic challenges and policy evaluation. This variance is rooted in the intraorganizational dynamics of the think tanks, which largely determines whether they become legitimizers of state actions or remain neutral crisis communicators.",University of Vienna,,,,,,,,University of Vienna,,Vera Axyonova,,,,,,,,Vera Axyonova,,Public Policy,Knowledge,Climate Change,Communication,Comparative Perspective,,,,Communicating Crisis in Illiberal Environments: Russian Think Tanks between Policy Evaluation and State Endorsement,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64119&EventID=185
0,"The European public sphere has been under study for more than two decades. During the same period of time, successive political crises have shaken the European Union. They have had inconsistent or even paradoxical effects with respect to the emergence of a transnational public sphere. Recent trends have been discussed using the interwoven developmental terms of Europeanisation and politicisation. By impairing traditional gatekeeping mechanisms and national container logics of industrialised media systems, social media such as Twitter have arguably served these trends by facilitating the formation of more fluid transnational issue publics. This paper takes up some of these strands and studies the temporal and time-varying integration of issue publics on Twitter during the major crisis Europe (and the entire world) is currently going through: the Covid19 pandemic. Do we observe new trends of transnational integration in Europe’s societal debates? Or do we see more nationally structured debates and communicative insulation driven by institutional nationalism in political crisis management? If overarching trends remain inconsistent, which correlations between the course of the pandemic and crisis management on the one hand, and transnational communication on the other can be observed? How do national user communities differ in this regard?
In order to study these questions, we rely on Twitter data obtained from the TBCOV database, i.e. a dataset for multilingual, geolocated Covid19-related Twitter communication. We selected corpora for the 27 member states of the EU plus the United Kingdom. We defined three research periods representing different phases of the pandemic, namely April (1st wave), August (interim) and December 2020 (2nd wave) resulting in a final set of corpora comprising 51,893,966 unique tweets for the comparative analysis. In order to measure the level and temporal variation of transnational discursive linkages we conducted a spatiotemporal network analysis of so-called Heterogeneous Information Networks (HINs). HINs allow for the integration of multiple, heterogeneous network entities to better represent the complex discursive structures represented in social media debates. For the initial construction of our HINs, we utilised different sorts of automatically extractable entities, namely hashtags, mentions, named entities, URLs and retweets, that correspond to different dimensions of discursive linkages. For our variable metrics, we counted instances for each of the discursive linkages represented by meta-paths via one of the entity types. Therefrom, we obtained an aggregate measure of transnational linkages on a daily base by relating these linkages back to their geolocated authors. Furthermore, we utilized the Covid Stringency Index, a day-wise composite measure based on indicators like school openness, work related restrictions and travel bans, to check for correlations between national crisis management and (trans-)national communication patterns on Twitter.
Preliminary findings suggest that the share of transnational discursive linkages correlates with the severity of the pandemic. Moreover, transnational linkages are higher during the second than during the first wave, indicating effects of institutionalisation. Stringent political measures of crisis management at the domestic level (such as lockdown decisions) seem to provoke stronger national structuration of Covid19-related Twitter discourse.",Hildesheim University,Hildesheim University,Hildesheim University,Ruprecht-Karls-Universität Heidelberg,,,,,Hildesheim University,,Wolf J.

0,"Contemporary European societies are governed by institutions and actors on various government levels, taking the shape of an integrated structure of multilevel governance. Whether citizens perceive these governing political institutions as legitimate is a key question. Indeed, although legitimacy is far from being a new concept (e.g. Weber, 1968), it has attracted renewed attention over the course of the last two decades, in particular in a context marked by the development of multilevel governance.  Yet, studies typically focus on institutions on only one or two levels. Hence, scholarship still lacks a comprehensive understanding of the concept of legitimacy in a multilevel context, as well as an integrated empirical approach to investigate the interaction between legitimacy beliefs in this multilevel context. The absence of a deep understanding of the relationship between citizens’ beliefs about the various governance levels they are subject to is problematic, as the multilevel setting has a profound impact on legitimation dynamics. Our paper aims to fill these conceptual and empirical gaps. We ask to what extent citizens perceive political institutions at the subnational, national, regional (i.c. the EU) and global level of governance as legitimate, on what normative grounds their legitimacy beliefs are constructed and how they relate to each other? Moreover, we ask how variation in citizens’ perceptions of legitimacy in this multilevel context be explained. 
To do so, we have fielded an original cross-national survey in eight European countries which vary in the extent to which multilevel governance has developed and is contested. In this survey, we included original questions to measure perceptions of legitimacy in a multilevel context both in terms of normative justifiability – in citizens’ own terms – and in terms of consent. These questions were developed (and pre-tested) to improve formerly used operationalizations of legitimacy (e.g. trust and support), assessing the strengths and limitations of these operationalizations against our conceptualization of legitimacy beliefs. Our cross-national survey thus enables us to study how legitimacy beliefs towards different institutions on different levels relate to each other, not only in terms of evaluation but also regarding their normative contents. Moreover, the survey is set up to allow us to investigate explanations for variation in legitimacy perceptions across levels. We test hypotheses regarding the national-institutional context, as well as individuals’ identification, utilitarian considerations, political attitudes and experiences. The study contributes to our understanding of how citizens view politics as it is organized today, dispersed across governance levels.",Université catholique de Louvain,Université catholique de Louvain,Maastricht Universiteit,Université catholique de Louvain,,,,,Maastricht Universiteit,,Thomas Laloux,Virginie Van Ingelgom,Soetkin Verhaegen,Alban Versailles,,,,,Soetkin Verhaegen,,Comparative Politics,European Union,Governance,Local Government,Regionalism,Global,Survey Research,,Comparing and explaining legitimacy beliefs towards political institutions in a multilevel context,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65609&EventID=185

political system. We asses these arguments with survey data on 79 large corporations across the three largest Western
economies: the United States, Germany, and the United Kingdom. The results show that the quality of a firms’ relationship with
policymakers is a key factor shaping corporate political strategy. Moreover, the distribution of corporate lobbying across

0,"Electoral competition is one of the basic indicators of the quality of democracy, as free party competition or contestation is one of the fundamental conditions of democracy. This is reflected in Dahl’s (1971) dimension of liberalization, which refers to the extent to which political opposition is able to compete for power. Therefore, as long as the party system is viewed as a system of interactions arising from interparty competition (Sartori 1976), the quality of those interactions represents the central focus of quality of subnational democracy in the dimension of competition. The present paper aims to contribute to a better understanding of regional-level party politics in post-communist Czech Republic and Poland. We follow the multilevel election perspective, which emphasizes that full understanding of regional-level electoral competition and the resulting shape of regional party systems is only possible when taking horizontal and vertical interactions between regional and other electoral arenas into consideration (Golder et al. 2017), i.e., the effects of vertical spill-over between the national and regional arenas as well as horizontal spill-over between various regional arenas (Schakel and Romanova 2021). We analyse data on electoral competition in all regional elections from the establishment of self-governing regions in Poland (1998) and the Czech Republic (2000) to the last regional elections in 2018 (Poland) or 2020 (the Czech Republic) in 14 Czech regions (kraje) and 16 Polish voivodships (województwa) and compare type of the party competition at the regional level against the form of party competition at the national level in a long-term comparison. The main goal of the paper is to examine especially three main research questions: What types of party systems have emerged in the Czech and Poland regions? How stable are they? Is it possible to identify some form of vertical spill-over between national and regional party systems (vertical spill-over) or does the development in one or more regional arenas impact on the shape of party systems in other regional arenas (horizontal spill-over)?",Jan Evangelista Purkyně University in Ústí nad Labem,,,,,,,,Jan Evangelista Purkyně University in Ústí nad Labem,,Pavel Maškarinec,,,,,,,,Pavel Maškarinec,,Europe (Central and Eastern),Comparative Politics,Elections,Local Government,Party Systems,,,,Comparing electoral competition at the subnational level: vertical and horizontal spill-over in Czech and Poland regional elections and their impact on multilevel democracy,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65328&EventID=185
0,"Vietnam and Bangladesh are two emerging lower middle-income economies with aspirations to become high income countries in next twenty years. Both have export-oriented economies with a potential of manufacturing and service sector growth and projections of high electricity demand. The rapid growth of demand and depletion of indigenous resources has led both countries to undertake an energy transition. However, in spite of their relatively similar energy paths from the 1980s through the 2000s, with electricity market reforms starting in the 90s, and similar energy challenges, the energy transitions of Vietnam and Bangladesh have unfolded differently since 2010. While Vietnam is rapidly growing solar power (26% of installed capacity by 2020), the country cancelled its nuclear power plant (NPP) in 2016. In contrast, in Bangladesh installed solar power capacity is still below 2% and the country has started construction of a large-scale NPP in 2017.
Here we seek to explain why Vietnam is adopting solar power while Bangladesh is adopting nuclear power. Using a most similar case study design and qualitative analysis we explore whether this is a case of crowding out (as one energy suppresses investment of the other) or the outcome is a result of combination of other political, techno-economic and socio-technical mechanisms.
Our preliminary findings indicate that the divergence between the energy paths of the two countries is not the result of intentional crowding out driven solely by the state, but rather combination of causal mechanisms in which external actors played important roles. Vietnam attracted solar investors to the country by offering a lucrative feed-in tariff (FITs) after China and Thailand had let similar FITs expire. The FIT success in Vietnam followed the Communist government’s state-led marketization. In contrast, Bangladesh with 50% of the electricity supplied by the private sector and a market-oriented economy could not benefit from the market led net-metering policy despite proving its capacity to have the largest off-grid solar power program in the world. This is because it lacked infrastructural support, incentives to regional solar investors and as yet could not transfer long experience of installing off-grid solar technologies to on-grid technologies.
The divergence in nuclear adoption can be explained partly due to distinct relationships with international actors. Bangladesh adopted highly expensive NPP, not because of its economic advantages, but because of strategic cooperation between the government of Bangladesh and Russia, aspiration to be a nuclear country, its symbolic value of development, and regional history of adopting nuclear by neighboring countries like India and Pakistan. Whereas, South East Asian neighboring countries of Vietnam have a history of not adopting nuclear. Vietnam could cancel the NPP even after investing millions of dollars because of its conglomerates’ stronger coal connection, growing potential to import coal from Russia.
Our contribution speaks to the under-researched question of energy transitions in the global south and on the technological periphery. We see that the divergence of energy outcome of Vietnam and Bangladesh can be largely explained by the role international actors play in shaping their energy transitions.",Central European University,Universitetet i Bergen,Central European University,,,,,,Central European University,,Aleh Cherp,Jessica Jewell,Moshahida Sultana,,,,,,Moshahida Sultana,,Asia,Development,Political Economy,International,Climate Change,Technology,Energy,Energy Policy,Comparing Electricity Transitions in Emerging Economies: Nuclear Growth in Bangladesh versus Solar Growth in Vietnam,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64575&EventID=185
0,"Policies continuously pile up in modern democracies. Organizations tasked with their implementation are confronted with the challenge to cope with an ever-increasing and more complex number of tasks. So far, the ability of organizations to cope with an expanding workload cardinally has been linked to hard resources — budget and staff. Yet, whether an organization is able to maintain its capacity despite a higher implementation load significantly depends on its ability to efficiently mobilize and distribute resources internally. Strikingly, however, this aspect has not been addressed systematically so far. We still lack analytical concepts that allow us to empirically capture changes in agency capacity at the aggregate level. We also lack theoretical explanations that might account for variation in accumulation-induced capacity losses across countries, sectors, or different implementation bodies. In this paper, I propose a new approach to address these research gaps in two ways. First, I develop a novel concept of capacity loss caused by policy accumulation allowing for the comparison of changes across organizations, sectors, and countries. Second, I suggest a new theoretical argument accounting for change in capacity. Centrally, I claim that organizational capacity gains or losses can be attributed to two factors, namely (1) agency legacy — internalized routines and structures that are difficult if not impossible to change and (2) agency management — organizational strategies that can be changed by reform, different leadership, or problem pressure. Third, I provide  an initial test of the conceptual and theoretical considerations by a most similar systems case study of the English Environment Agency and the Irish Environmental Protection Agency.",Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München – LMU,,,,,,,,Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München – LMU,,Dionys Zink,,,,,,,,Dionys Zink,,Comparative Politics,Environmental Policy,Institutions,Public Administration,Policy Change,Policy Implementation,,,Comparing policy accumulation induced capacity loss in public sector organizations,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65740&EventID=185
0,"It is crucial to understand the dynamics of phase-outs of non-sustainable energy carriers to accelerate the decarbonization of the economy in hindsight of the climate crisis. Taking the German example, the exit of nuclear energy as a successful policy is compared to the phase-out process of coal power to provide new insights on such policy change. The historical pathway of each phase-out policy is examined as the basis for the comparison. In general, the German nuclear phase-out is driven by a strong anti-nuclear sentiment in the public and as a political strategy whereas for the exit of coal the socio-ecological movement, a severe drought in 2018 and a deep institutional academic and non-academic knowledge transfer for the climate crisis were the main drivers. The examination together with the deductive thematic analysis enables then to identify commonalities and differences of the two phase-out policies that manifest themselves in the following dimensions: institutionalization, visibility of impacts, public image, and incumbency. The ethics committee of the German nuclear phase-out in 2011 was a pivotal institutionalised actor in fostering the final exit. Its reasoning resonated in the public delightfully as it changed nuclear powers image and provided the argumentative pathway for the then chancellor Merkel to turn around her energy politics. Based on the acquired learnings, a convocation of an ethics committee to evaluate the moral implications of the climate crisis is able to foster the acceleration of future fossil fuel phase-outs.",TU Berlin,,,,,,,,TU Berlin,,Tom Selje,,,,,,,,Tom Selje,,Political Economy,Public Policy,Qualitative Comparative Analysis,Comparative Perspective,Policy Change,Energy Policy,,,Comparing the German exit of nuclear and coal: Assessing the historical pathways with the deductive thematic analysis to identify energy phase-out dimensions,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63228&EventID=185
0,"Can deliberative democratic innovations like mini-publics reach their normative promises? This is a crucial and perennial concern for political scientists and policy makers, especially in a context of democratic malaise. A recent meta-analysis of the literature has suggested that the answer might be positive, though emphasizing that the empirical evidence remains small given the little number of studies on the topic (van der Does and Jacquet, 2021). Moreover, empirical studies are strongly divided between those focusing on the impact on the participants and those who focus on impact for the larger public, with no existing attempt to consider both sides of the coin at the same time and connect both strands of research. This paper bridges this gap by using an original panel study of the participants and the non-participants to a deliberative mini-public on climate protection in Luxembourg. In 2022, the Government of Luxembourg has decided to set up the “Klima BiergerRot (KBR)”, which is a Citizens’ Assembly on Climate. It gathers 60 citizens to deliberate about recommendations formulated to the Government and the Parliament for meeting the objectives of Luxembourg for fighting climate change. For the paper, we are using two panel surveys (before/after the DMP, with the same questionnaire simultaneously administrated for both groups), one with all participants to the citizens’ assembly (N=100 maximum: 60 active participants, 40 substitute) and one with a representative sample of the population of Luxembourg (N=1500 minimum, TNS as provider). The analysis will then compare how being exposed to a deliberative mini-public has affected participants and non-participants’ attitudes towards deliberative democracy, about representative democracy, and about democracy more widely. In doing so, we aim to provide an original contribution on the larger debate whether democratic innovations can reach their normative hopes.",University of Luxembourg,Université Libre de Bruxelles,Université Libre de Bruxelles,Université Libre de Bruxelles,,,,,University of Luxembourg,,Emilien Paulis,Jean-Benoit Pilet,Sebastien Rojon,Davide Vittori,,,,,Emilien Paulis,,Democracy,Political Participation,Public Opinion,,,,,,Comparing the impact of the citizens’ assembly on climate in Luxembourg on participants and non-participants.,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64718&EventID=185
0,"Populism has most often been examined from the supply-side of politics, as scholarship primarily focused on the rhetoric of populist movements, parties, and leaders. Most empirical research before the 2010s was based on qualitative approaches (e.g., Betz, 1994; Taggart, 2000; Mudde, 2007). Since then, an increasing number of studies take a more quantitative approach, as they delve into the study of both the supply- and demand-side of populism by using survey items to measure populist attitudes. Based on an ideational approach, that is, the belief that populism is a set of ideas, populism can be measured as an attitude that individuals can possess to a greater or a lesser extent (Rooduijn 2018: 364). This approach paves the way for examining populism, both at the demand and the supply side, with quantitative methods. Recent scholarship uses survey items to gauge levels of populism amongst individuals. These individual-level studies on populist attitudes form the foundation of the elite surveys and the expert surveys on populism. 
This paper intends to study and compare the positions of Greek voters, candidates and political parties on a number of issues related to populism through quantitative research. Relying on the data of 2019 Greek national election studies (i.e., candidate and voter surveys) and an expert survey we aim to answer the following research question: do voters share the same views on issues related to populism as the candidates and political parties they vote for? In addition, studying their opinions on immigrants, minority rights, social liberalism etc. we will identify right-wing and left-wing populism in both voters and political parties.   
However, as with any survey, some survey items may not work, so this paper’s goal is also to identify the survey items of populism that work and those that do not.
In this paper we use Greece as a case study; however, as many of the survey items used in these post-election studies have been used in surveys in other countries, this work contributes to the comparative research of populism and aims at encouraging scholars from other countries to include more survey items related to populism in their future election studies.",Aristotle University of Thessaloniki,Aristotle University of Thessaloniki,,,,,,,Aristotle University of Thessaloniki,,Maria Tsigkou,Ioannis Andreadis,,,,,,,Maria Tsigkou,,Elites,Populism,Candidate,Survey Experiments,Survey Research,Voting Behaviour,,,Comparison of the positions of voters and candidates on populism:  the Greek case,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65464&EventID=185
0,"This paper examines the distinctive trajectories of two systems of higher education.  Ukraine and Uzbekistan both gained independence in 1991.  In the Soviet period, both countries had systems of higher education dominated by the Russian language.  The primary language of instruction at flagship universities in both countries was Russian.  Academics in both countries shared strong intellectual and personal ties with colleagues across the Soviet academic landscape.  Similarly, at the institutional level, universities throughout the Soviet space engaged in close collaboration with one another.  After 1991, with the introduction of nationalist language policies, the higher education systems in both countries adopted distinctive paths forward.  Universities in Uzbekistan now have quite low rates of Russian language usage in the classroom.  We argue that the nationalist trend in Uzbekistan resulted less from a top-down effort to impose Uzbek as the language of instruction and more as a result of demographic shifts that have resulted in fewer and fewer Russian language students.  The nationalization by default path in Uzbekistan contrasts markedly with the Ukrainian case. In the aftermath of the Maidan movement in Ukraine, the state oversaw a campaign to limit the use of Russian in Ukrainian universities.  This top-down effort to enforce language use has met resistance from both students and faculty.  Drawing from interviews with faculty members and academic administrators at universities in both countries, our paper engages in a comparative analysis of both cases.",University of West Georgia,"V.N.Karazin National University, School of Sociology",University of West Georgia,,,,,,University of West Georgia,,Mikhail Beznosov,Artem Lytovchenko,Neema Noori,,,,,,Neema Noori,,National Identity,Nationalism,Policy Analysis,Political Sociology,Qualitative,Education,,,Competing Nationalisms:  A Comparative Analysis of Higher Education Language Policy in Ukraine and Uzbekistan,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63755&EventID=185
0,"Election pledges commit parties to implement certain policies and provide certain outcomes after an election. Although parties get little reward from voters and lose flexibility, parties regularly commit themselves to certain policies by making these pledges. In this paper, I examine why parties commit to such a high extent. I argue that parties make pledges to signal credibility to voters, when the party is close to competing parties’ positions. Compared to other campaign statements, election pledges can make voters more confident that parties will act on their words, so a party with more commitments will ceteris paribus have an advantage over other parties with similar positions on an issue. I test my expectation by manually coding election manifestoes from parties in Denmark, United Kingdom, and United States from the last three decades to measure the extent to which each party makes commitments on an issue. I find support for my argument by showing that the share of commitments increases when the average positional distance to other parties on an issue decreases.

0,"Power is the central concept of international relations and international politics. To categorize the various ways of thinking about power, there is a valuable taxonomy of four types of power, namely compulsory, institutional, structural, and productive. This understanding of power provides a framework to analyze China’s evolving engagement with UNESCO. UNESCO is the world’s largest intellectual platform and a controversial international organization. China has the peculiarity of a dual identity as a developing country on one hand and a major power and UNESCO’s largest contributor on the other. Therefore, power relations are more noticeable in China’s interaction with UNESCO. First, under UNESCO’s constitution, UNESCO’s compulsory power is mainly expressed in its independent budgetary power, that is dependent on large countries for contributions but equal in decision-making to large and small countries, making China, the largest contributor, a fragile power. Second, China’s institutional power is expressed though the General Conference proposals. Though China has been more actively participating in UNESCO affairs in the last decade, the number of proposals from China has been declining, while the wide groups of civil society in China has become more passionate as an institutionalized partner with UNESCO, which shows a shift of institutional power from the government to the society. Third, in terms of structural power, China has gradually abandoned the traditional developed–development, donor–recipient structural power and reshaped the bloc diplomacy based on country’s interests at UNESCO. Finally, UNESCO is one of the most influential knowledge-producing institutions in the world, hence China’s role is more of implementation of UNESCO’s norms and agendas, making China a subordinate of UNESCO’s productive power. Concerning future research, the interactive analytical framework of power could also be applied to analyze China’s interactions with other international organizations and observe the changes caused by Chinese influence on them.",Zhejiang University,,,,,,,,Zhejiang University,,Wenting Meng,,,,,,,,Wenting Meng,,China,International Relations,UN,International,,,,,Competition and Coexistence of Powers in the “Three UNs”: A Framework Analyzing China’s Evolving Engagement with UNESCO,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63362&EventID=185
0,"Only recently have scholars started to pay attention to the regional dimension of authoritarianism and democratization in the Middle East. Motivated by the growing literature that focuses on the role Russia and China play in “authoritarian promotion” and “diffusion”, scholars have explored the role of “learning” and regional organizations in authoritarian resilience and identified Saudi Arabia, UAE, and Iran as active authoritarian prompters or “Black Knights” who use various forms of economic, military, and political assistance to bolster authoritarian governments. This paper shifts the focus from simple authoritarian cooperation and promotion to a specific type of authoritarian support characterized by regional competition. In authoritarian competitive involvement, multiple rival countries intervene simultaneously and oppositely to support opposing sides during a democratic transition, namely the old regime or the military and the political group leading the democratic transition, influencing their behavior and preferences. Therefore, rather than focusing on patron-client interaction, I study the web of interactions among different external and domestic actors. 

Drawing on evidence from the democratic transitions in Egypt (2011-2013) and Sudan (2019-2021), I develop a theoretical framework for this type of international involvement. I argue that a counterrevolution and a democratic breakdown are more likely in a situation of competitive authoritarian involvement for two reasons. First, regional competition boosts the level and nature of the patron’s support to the old regime. This unconstrained and unconditional support enhances its repressive capacity, reduces the cost of repression, and hardens its negotiating position. Secondly, competitive involvement increases the threat perception of both other opposition factions and the military. This creates an extremely polarized environment in which growing inter-elite distrust and anti-democratic preferences can de-mobilize the opposition and further lower the costs of repression. In cases of typical authoritarian support not characterized by competition, the military is more likely to accept a power sharing agreement and thus counterrevolution attempts are less likely to succeed.  To investigate that claim, the paper leverages a controlled comparative analysis and draws extensively on Arabic language primary sources, including newspaper reports and articles, TV clips and interviews, official statements, NGOs reports, international media, and secondary literature.

This paper advances the literature on the international dimension of democratization and authoritarianism by introducing a novel type of international involvement and by explaining variation in the effectiveness of foreign sponsorship on regime survival, a question that remains under examined in the literature. In addition, the paper supports the increasingly salient claim that polarization matters in the study of democratization and repression. It also contributes to that literature by introducing a new dynamic source for political polarization and state repression rooted in the international environment, which goes beyond the focus on stationary material and long-term factors.",University of Toronto,,,,,,,,University of Toronto,,Salam Alsaadi,,,,,,,,Salam Alsaadi,,Comparative Politics,Contentious Politics,Democratisation,Regionalism,Developing World Politics,Qualitative,Political Regime,Protests,Competitive Support from Regional Patrons and Democratic Transitions,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=62763&EventID=185
0,"The arrival of large numbers of migrants in Austria seeking international protection after 2014 and their dispersal across the territory transformed existing and initiated new ‘arrival infrastructures’ (Meeus et al. 2019, 2020) and thus had a major impact on local governance regimes. In this paper, we focus on the role of non-governmental organisations and civil society initiatives in advocating for change and providing service, respectively (see Ataç & de Jong, 2017, Simsa, 2017). Focusing on four localities in Austria – a medium sized town, a small town and two rural municipalities and their surroundings – we can observe different types of organisations active in relation to migrant integration as well as different types of interaction with formal government levels as well as with each other. While both civil society organisations and service-oriented NGOs have been firmly integrated into local governance regimes in all four contexts, their shape, role and degree of autonomy differs remarkably between different contexts. In addition, we find that the geographical scope and location of organisations does not necessarily correspond to divisions of competences between different levels, highlighting the role of ‘networked’ forms of governance.  Our paper contributes to two research gaps in the literature: namely the relative absence of research on civil society actors outside of large cities and the focus of must research on their involvement in “emergency management”.

0,"One conceptualization of 'good representation' may be analogized as a kind of mirror on the populace. A 'perfect' political assembly, therefore, reflects both the political and demographic composition of the country without distortion. Progress toward more statistically representative legislatures is simple to measure in cases where there is only one under-represented group of interest; accordingly, we have tracked the slow but steady improvement in the presence of women and marginalized groups across liberal democracies. However, the descriptive representation literature has not yet settled on an effective method to describe and summarize under-representation among multiple subgroups of the population simultaneously. To this end, I propose a method derivative of the Gallagher index (used in measures of proportionality of electoral systems), which enables a summary statistic for multiple groups that is a multi-dimensional generalization of the gender gap. I then apply the measure to the representation of occupational class in the Australian Parliament (1985-2020) to show that, while the representation of women has improved significantly since the 1980s, the representation of occupational class has declined slightly. The method and findings contribute to a nascent literature that is concerned with the consequences of complex descriptive representation (for example, the interplay of gender and occupation) for the quality of democratic outcomes.",Australian National University,,,,,,,,Australian National University,,Patrick Leslie,,,,,,,,Patrick Leslie,,Elites,Gender,Parliaments,Political Methodology,Candidate,Party Members,Quantitative,Empirical,Complex Descriptive Representation: Proportionality of Occupation and Gender in Australia,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=62280&EventID=185
0,"Faced with a growing public backlash, Global Governance Institutions (GGIs) are more frequently engaging in discursive self-legitimation. The European Union is not only one of the GGIs with the most influence on national politics, but it is also one of the most publicly criticized. As a result, the European Commission has reinforced efforts to communicate its work. However, one crucial barrier to these attempts is the inherent difficulty of communicating the often highly technical decisions of the European Commission. As a result, communication attempts of the European Commission are exceedingly complex. What are the effects of this complex messaging on attitudes towards decisions of the European Commission? Possibly, such self-legitimation attempts may weaken instead of strengthening public EU support, as complex messaging may increase aversion towards the EU and reinforce perceptions of the technocratic nature of the institution. Past research has focused on the content of self-legitimation by GGIs. But this content must be understood by the public to have a legitimating effect beyond a small group of politically sophisticated individuals. Implementing a preregistered survey experiment in Germany (N = 1200), I investigate the effects of complex messaging on attitudes towards two infringement procedures against Germany instigated by the European Commission related to two directives: The Habitats Directive and the Electricity and Gas Directive. I show that more accessible language markedly improves support for the infringement procedures. This effect is especially strong for supporters of the EU and individuals with comparatively high or low education. An exploratory analysis of the impact of this treatment on emotional self-reports shows that less complex language does not lead to a backlash from EU opponents. This study's results could help understand the conditions under which the self-legitimation strategies of EU institutional actors are likely to be effective.",Westfälische Wilhelms-Universität Münster,,,,,,,,Westfälische Wilhelms-Universität Münster,,Paul Meiners,,,,,,,,Paul Meiners,,European Union,Communication,Survey Experiments,,,,,,Complex Language and Attitudes Towards the European Union: Communicating European Commission Infringement Proceedings,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63566&EventID=185
0,"I argue in this paper that intra-personal compromise plays an important but largely neglected role for political veganism. I further argue that even though compromising intra-personally can help vegan activists to achieve their goals, some compromises inevitably come with a moral cost that may not be acceptable to individual activists. 
According to recent empirical data, most vegan activists (henceforth V) consider the suffering of non-human animals to be the most important reason for living vegan, while only a minority considers other motives, such as environmental or health concerns, to be the most important reason for veganism (e.g., Kalte, 2021). It can therefore be said that raising awareness about animal suffering is of utmost importance to V. I call this the awareness-raising-principle, in short: principle (A). On the other hand, to reduce animal suffering, V also aim to promote veganism as effectively as possible. I call this the effectiveness-principle, in short: principle (E). 
However, principles (A) and (E) are not always compatible, i.e., they cannot always be simultaneously realized. More concretely, I suggest that an incompatibility arises in situations where V address an audience with pre-existing values that support veganism without reference to animal suffering, e.g., a concern for protecting the environment, alleviating world hunger, or increasing public health. In these situations, the effectiveness-principle (E) requires V to promote veganism in terms of those pre-existing values rather than in terms of animal suffering, which is notoriously difficult to convey (e.g., Loughnan et al., 2010, Piazza et al., 2015; Rothgerber & Rosenfeld, 2021). However, realizing principle (E) in this scenario – catering to the audience, so to speak – inevitably means refraining from realizing principle (A). And vice versa, if V choose to realize (A), they cannot realize (E), since (A) is, in this case, not the most effective way to proceed.
This dilemma situation constitutes a classical scenario for intra-personal compromise. Because both principles are incompatible, V unavoidably have to sacrifice something, no matter which choice they make: If V choose to focus on animal suffering, they compromise principle (E), thus sacrificing effectiveness. And if V choose to tailor to the audience and exclude references to animal suffering, they compromise principle (A), thus sacrificing their most important value. 
Based on a cost-benefit analysis of both compromise options, I argue that compromising (A) comes with a distinct moral cost that compromising (E) does not entail: By promoting veganism for reasons other than animal suffering, V implicitly demote animals to mere means rather than ends in themselves, thus also betraying their moral value as sentient beings. I conclude that while both intra-personal compromises can support V in achieving their goal of reducing animal suffering, compromising E may be preferable to compromising A, given the unique moral cost that the latter entails for the individual vegan activist.",Université de Lausanne,,,,,,,,Université de Lausanne,,Friderike Spang,,,,,,,,Friderike Spang,,Political Participation,Political Theory,Social Movements,Political Activism,,,,,Compromising on incompatible values: The case of political veganism,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63638&EventID=185
0,"Bureaucratic nepotism —an undue preference for family members—undermines the merit-based systems for recruitment and promotion in public sector employment that are foundational for an effective, efficient, and legitimate public administration. Identifying the extent and depth of nepotism is crucial for launching public policies aiming to reduce corruption and enhance the quality of bureaucratic public service delivery, however it is difficult to identify and measure systematically. Existing empirical studies on nepotism struggle with the ambiguity of the concept and often fail to produce reliable and replicable measures. We contribute to understanding the link between the concept and the measures of bureaucratic nepotism from two angles. Conceptually, we unpack the nepotism definition into three components: a family tie, the preferential treatment to get a job or promotion, and the lack of qualification. We assess the operationalization of these components in three of the most common measures in the literature: matching surnames, declaration of family ties and perception surveys. We find that none of the measures alone meet the validity, reliability, and replicability criteria. Empirically, using original data, we provide an assessment of the three measures in the context of the Mexican judiciary, an institution long signalled for having this problem. We find that the three measures partially capture different aspects of the same underlying phenomenon. We discuss the pros and cons of each measurement and how they relate the concept to the empirical approach. This suggest that future empirical studies on nepotism should consider complementary perspectives to build a reliable and replicable measure as a starting point to explore its effects on the public administration performance.",Kings College London,,,,,,,,Kings College London,,Luis Fernando Soto Tamayo,,,,,,,,Luis Fernando Soto Tamayo,,Latin America,Public Administration,Corruption,,,,,,Concept and Measures of Bureaucratic Nepotism: Evidence from the Mexican Judiciary,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64329&EventID=185
0,"The paper defines concepts as descriptions of types.   Using the intension and extension distinction it suggests that conceptual change can come about in two ways.  First, we can learn more about that to which our concept refers and so change our description of it.  This might involve discovering characteristics of the object that we thought were true of it but are not in fact true and/or so we realize it has sets of characteristics of which we were originally unaware.  The object itself has not changed, just our understanding of it.  Thus, our descriptions of the type changes.  The intension changes but the extension does not. That is one form of conceptual change.  

Second, the object itself can change as it develops. So, for example, the possibilities for governing change with technological change and so the object to which the term ‘the state’ refers to changes over time.  Correct descriptions of the state will have to reflect those object changes.  Here we note, that previous descriptions of ‘the state’ might no longer be appropriate to current states, but might still be appropriate to historical ones.  The former descriptions were not incorrect to their original referents, but now need to be modified for current referents. We can either claim we now have a different concept for the modern state or we can see them as the same underlying concept but with a referent that is evolving.  Which route we choose might depend on our research question and whether we do comparative static analysis or developmental analysis. 

These two types of concept change are relatively straightforward for concepts that apply to empirical types.  Only relatively straightforward however, since types do include non-actual but potential token examples.

For more normative concepts the same distinction in the two forms of conceptual change can occur.  We can discover implications of our normative account of which we were previously unaware.  Or our description can change as our moral understanding changes perhaps because of new empirical discoveries.  At the normative level, these two different types of aspects are often epistemically indistinguishable.  The one difference is that we might treat past uses of the concept within historical context as being appropriate for that context, even though our current understanding are judgementally applicable to past contexts.

This epistemic indistinction causes problems for any account of conceptual change for normative concepts. The paper concentrates on these problems, focusing on the idea that for normative concepts all we have are rival accounts.  Conceptual change does not make sense for normative concepts, only conceptual understanding having different historical moments.",Australian National University,,,,,,,,Australian National University,,Keith Dowding,,,,,,,,Keith Dowding,,Political Methodology,Political Theory,Analytic,Methods,Normative Theory,Theoretical,,,Concepts and Conceptual Change,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63516&EventID=185
0,"Politically motivated action by shareholders and other investors is variously labelled as shareholder activism, corporate activism, or socially responsible investment, and recognised as political participation under the banner of political consumerism. However, this inconsistent labelling and categorisation of investors’ activism as political consumerism fails to capture the unique role and diverse political participation of different types of investors. Moreover, while there is a considerable body of work on consumers’ political participation, investors’ political participation has received comparatively little attention. This is despite social movement organisations’ (SMOs) increasing use of investment-based tactics such as divestment campaigns, shareholder resolutions, and boycotts of financial institutions on issues including climate change, labour exploitation, and human rights abuses. 

This paper seeks to remedy the rhetorical blurring and limited conceptualisation of investors’ political participation by defining and developing the concept of ‘political investorism’ to serve as a cohering term for investment-based political participation. Drawing upon illustrative cases from Australia, we use process-tracing to map the political participation of investors and shareholders, and the mobilisation strategies used by social movement organisations. We find a diverse range of tactics and identify key hallmarks and categories of ‘political investorism’. We argue that situating the discourse around the term ‘political investorism’, as a concept distinct from but related to political consumerism, provides essential clarity to examine the unique role of investors as political actors. Recognising key differences between consumers’ and investors’ political participation will help to guide future examinations of investment-based political participation at a time when shifts in global governance and limitations on more traditional avenues for political participation are amplifying the importance of market-based activism for social change.",University of Technology Sydney,Queensland University of Technology,Queensland University of Technology,Queensland University of Technology,,,,,Queensland University of Technology,,Martijn Boersma,Justine Coneybeer,Erin O'Brien,Alice Payne,,,,,Erin O'Brien,,Political Participation,Social Movements,Climate Change,Mobilisation,Political Activism,Capitalism,,,Conceptualising investors’ political participation,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=62753&EventID=185

First, it argues against attempts to stretch the concept so that it covers not only restrictive measures but any type of action that aims to defend democracy. Second, it identifies MD with the principle and practice of exclusion; this broadening of the concept allows tracking its presence not only in the legal domain –as a practice of rights restrictions– but also in the political and societal domains –as a practice of cordon sanitaire and media censoring respectively. Third, it distinguishes justifications for MD as grounded respectively on three principles: (1) reason, (2) sovereignty, and (3) harm. It concludes by suggesting that, despite their differences as to what justifies pre-emptive exclusion, all MD theories share a similar conception of democracy: as instrumentally justified, substantive and value driven.",Uppsala Universitet,,,,,,,,Uppsala Universitet,,Anthoula Malkopoulou,,,,,,,,Anthoula Malkopoulou,,Democracy,Political Participation,Political Theory,Voting,,,,,Conceptualising Militant Democracy,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64441&EventID=185
0,"Paper proposal for consideration of panel 3 on ‘Political Parties and Party Competition in Multilevel States’.

The rise of regional government has induced a great scholarly interest into the question whether regional authority impacts on territorial inequalities regarding policy outputs and outcomes (Toubeau and Kleider 2022). Two key characteristics of this literature is that scholars tend to include federal (Austria, Belgium, Germany, Switzerland) and regionalized (Italy and Spain) countries and the main independent variable is often incongruence between regional and national governments. In this paper we argue that existing measurements of incongruence are neither reliable or valid indicators of government incongruence. Our criticism concerns two main caveats which arise out of insufficient knowledge about regional electoral systems and the relationships between regional parliaments and executives. For example, a focus on executives is not sufficient to tap government incongruence and one need to include parliaments as well. For example, in Italy and France regional presidents head the regional executive and exercise all executive powers but they also always rely on parliamentary majorities even in Italy where regional presidents are directly elected. 
	Second, the inclusion of unitary and more centralized countries is necessary to find the scope conditions under which regional authority and government incongruence (can) produce territorial inequalities regarding policy outputs and outcomes. Importantly, parliamentary-executive relations differ substantially from those in regions in federal and regionalized countries as well as those at the national level. For example, regional executives may be dual and include centrally appointed officials (Dutch provinces) or regional executives share authority with another central authority in the region (counties in Norway and Sweden). In some regions, the mayor is not only the head of the regional executive but is also the chair of important and obligatory committees of the parliament (Danish regions) whereas in other regions the regional executive is single headed but its decisions need to be cleared by a centrally appointed official (French regions). 
Finally, through exploratory analyses we reveal significant variation in parliamentary-executive relations and government incongruence across regions and countries, as well as over time. Furthermore, we tentatively assess how regional identity, regional authority, and regional electoral institutions relate to parliamentary-executive relations and government incongruence.",Universitetet i Bergen,Universitetet i Bergen,,,,,,,Universitetet i Bergen,,Arjan H.

0,"Parties’ collaboration with interest groups is both important and perilous for democratic governance. Interest groups can both strengthen (in their function as “democratic transmission belts”) and weaken the linkage between voters and representatives. As the erosion of traditional social cleavages has led political parties to interact with a more diverse set of interest groups, the risk of parties being sidetracked by interest groups has increased. The present article studies how parliamentary party groups manage this risk through so-called “lobbying safeguards”. These can be understood as rules and practices within the parliamentary group that help curtailing potentially problematic relationships to IGs. Through a series of semi-structured interviews with current and former members of both the National Assembly of Québec and the Parliament of Canada, we proceed to an exhaustive mapping of these practices. In a second step, we reflect on how the presence of such safeguards can be assessed in the context of specific policy issues. In this manner, we seek to contribute to studying how the party rationale impinges upon the relationship between the individual MP and the interest group.",University of Geneva,,,,,,,,University of Geneva,,Steven Eichenberger,,,,,,,,Steven Eichenberger,,Interest Groups,Political Parties,Lobbying,,,,,,Conceptualizing and Measuring Parliamentary Party Groups’ Lobbying Safeguards,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65044&EventID=185
0,"More so now than ever before – at the juncture of new and old resurfacing glocal crises – global citizenship education (GCE) is being framed as a pedagogical tool that can effectively address globalization and the interdependences and inequalities it generates. At the heart of such an education is a premise that claims that, if equipped with appropriate knowledge, attitudes, and skills, self-realization of “global citizenship” is possible, and consequently, students can begin thinking and acting beyond their local circumstances to address global challenges. However, as with any other education, if seen as neutral or normative, global citizenship education and the concept of “global citizenship” it proposes may reproduce harmful (un)acknowledged assumptions about the world. Consequently, as seminal work by Pashby points out, when approaching GCE, one should always ask “for whom and by whom” is GCE designed, who profits from it, and who does not. Making use of the postcolonial concept of hierarchization, this study aims to show that GCE puts into place particular discursive strategies that delineate who is the “global citizen” that can act as the “subject” and who is constructed as the “object” about which knowledge is being produced, thus, recreating the ages-old Self-Other binary. To demonstrate the existence of such colonial binaries, the method of Critical Discourse Analysis is applied to the case of Slovak GCE. By pointing out the presence of particular discursive strategies of activation-passivation, personalization-impersonalization, generalization-specification, this study, thus, reveals that, like every citizenship, the idea of “global citizenship” in GCE is based on the idea of who does and does not belong, who can become the “global citizen” and who cannot.","Faculty of Social and Economic Sciences, Comenius University",,,,,,,,"Faculty of Social and Economic Sciences, Comenius University",,Kristína Rankovová,,,,,,,,Kristína Rankovová,,Citizenship,Global,Qualitative,Education,,,,,Conceptualizing Global Citizenship in Global Citizenship Education: Who Can Be the Global Citizen?

A fuzzy-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (fsQCA) with 17 carefully selected decision-making processes in four IOs (FAO, WHO, ILO, UNESCO) shows that all international bureaucracies studied can be influential in favourable contexts. Autonomy of will allows IPAs to substantially influence policies, even in adverse contexts. Low autonomy of will, among other factors, explains why IPAs cannot exert influence, while autonomy of action appears largely irrelevant. In-depth post-QCA case studies reveal that stakeholder trust in the administration and the salience of a decision for the entire group of stakeholders are additional explanatory factors.

0,"Recently, autocratization processes have increasingly attracted scholarly attention. Although researchers have chosen countries as units of analysis, the literature on regime internal variations demonstrates that autocratization can develop at subnational levels. Accordingly, we claim that autocratization can be successfully opposed at the local level. The article shall thus focus on the role of capital cities in autocratizing countries. We argue that this perspective can help shed light on overlooked aspects of regime developments. In fact, we will look at how urban spaces can constitute ‘democratic enclaves’ which may reverse autocratization. Grassroot participatory initiatives on the use of urban public space or open assemblies on budget spending are among the examples of these localized practices of re-democratization.
After introducing the theoretical framework, the paper will map divergent regime developments at the subnational and national level in Southeast Europe (SEE), i.e. the trajectories of hegemonic and opposition forces in the national and city-level executives. Then, it will explore three case-studies: Budapest, Banja Luka, and Zagreb. They have been chosen as capitals of SEE countries experiencing recent autocratization or democratic backsliding. In fact, under the longstanding leadership of, respectively, Viktor Orbán and Milorad Dodik, Hungary and Republika Srpska have embarked upon an autocratization path over the past decade, whereas Croatia has been marked by a less severe, albeit noticeable, democratic backsliding. Nonetheless, these cities also represent typical cases of opposition’s victory in the capital, against the dominant parties at the central government: Gergely Karácsony’s broad anti-Fidesz coalition in 2019 in Hungary, Draško Stanivuković’s Party of Democratic Progress and its allies against Milorad Dodik’s forces in 2020 in Bosnia’s Republika Srpska, and finally Tomislav Tomašević’s Yes, We Can! movement, which surprisingly defeated the Croatian Democratic Union at the 2021 Zagreb local elections. With insights from case-specific literature, and interviews with experts, the paper aims to answer two research questions: which were the drivers of the opposition victory in Budapest, Banja Luka, and Zagreb? More generally, which conditions can enable the opposition to turn an electoral victory in the capital into a wedge to effectively resist and reverse statewide autocratization? 
We shall test the hypothesis that the opposition’s strategies for winning elections in multilevel polities are shaped by what we label as the ‘nationalization-insulation’ dilemma: at the urban level, the opposition might decide to ‘nationalize’ the political contestation and present itself as the anti-establishment alternative, to win mayoral elections by rallying ’round the flag’ in a larger front against the authoritarian incumbent. However, this strategy might equally penalize the opposition in future national contests, since the incumbent party often relies on strong rural basis and statewide support, while the opposition’s legitimacy mainly derives from being entrenched in the capital. Overcoming this dilemma, namely being able to both ‘nationalize and insulate’, is pivotal to win elections in multiple layers, and thus oust autocratic actors.

0,"Transparency and participation are two of the prime means of democratization. The status of citizen participation in public debates of good governance has been described as ‘sacrosanct’ (Day 1997), the significance of transparency as ‘quasi-religious’ (Hood 2006). This applies in particular to the environmental policy field, where influential pressure groups have pushed very strongly for a ‘participatory turn’ and public access to information, leading to a codification of these demands in national, European and international conventions and policy guidelines. How to actually deliver on participatory and transparent policy-making is far from straightforward, however. Democracy scholars have pointed out repeatedly that citizen participation usually suffers from a class bias and is not necessarily particularly democratic or ‘good in itself’ (Brown 2009, 223). Besides, research has emphasized that the effect of transparency may be negative (de Fine et al. 2011, 5) and indeed paralysing when it promotes demagoguery, misinformation and rigidity.
Against this background, this study asks how to make the most of transparency and participation. More precisely, it discusses how to design democratic innovations in such a way that they combine meaningful, democratic participation with a non-paralysing openness of governance, without jeopardizing other democratic values. Based on democratic theory, the study first underlines why transparency and participation potentially clash with other important sources of democratic legitimacy, such as efficient conflict resolution and fair and equal deliberation. In a second step, it is shown under which institutional conditions such tensions are moderated, using empirical examples of democratic innovations from the environmental and climate policy field and paying special attention to the disenchantment that public engagement practices generate among the involved citizens.",Johannes Gutenberg-Universität Mainz,,,,,,,,Johannes Gutenberg-Universität Mainz,,Eva Krick,,,,,,,,Eva Krick,,Governance,Political Participation,Climate Change,Policy-Making,,,,,"Consolidating participatory, transparent policy-making in the environmental and climate field",https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64185&EventID=185

This study is based on a CAQDAS analysis of parliamentary speeches from over the last decade. The author not only detects the main political actors which used the Soros conspiracy theories but also offers main meta-narratives used within Slovak political discourse. The study found that extreme-right and populist actors (K-ĽSNS, Sme rodina) have been detected as proponents of this political strategy, but also a traditional left-wing social democratic, Smer-SD has utilized and incorporated conspiracy rhetoric into their political speeches. The author argues that the conspiracy rhetoric is necessary to examine in a broader context of so-called “cultural wars” that divides society and it contributes to undermining a very fragile Slovak democracy. Finally, the contribution would like to discuss the critical thoughts on the role of traditional political parties, which gave opportunities to populists and extreme-right forces, and de facto unintentionally contributed to legitimizing conspiracy rhetoric as such.",Palacký University,,,,,,,,Palacký University,,Lubomir Zvada,,,,,,,,Lubomir Zvada,,Democracy,Extremism,Political Parties,Populism,Qualitative,Mobilisation,Narratives,,"Conspiracy theories about George Soros: actors, narratives and implications for Slovak politics",https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64970&EventID=185
0,"We propose an analytical approach to constellations of competition in higher education. It takes the most conventional starting point possible – Georg Simmel's (2008) triadic model. Contemporary work on competition cannot do without the obligatory Simmel reference in both sociology and cultural studies. But, with a few remarkable exceptions (Werron 2009; Mayer 2019), the analytical potential of the approach is hardly ever exhausted. Taking Simmel's notion of triadic constellations of competition seriously and combining it with insights from valuation studies (Waibel et al. 2021) and the theory of social fields (Krause 2018), our paper advances the current conversation on competition in three ways. 
First, we develop an analytical framework for multiple competition. Most of the recent liter-ature on competition assumes – like Simmel – that actors are involved in a plurality of com-petitions. However, the focus is usually on an abstract concept of competition, on the pene-tration of contemporary society with a competitive template, or selected competitions. In contrast, relations between various competitions are not systematically theorized. To fill this gap, we propose an analytical framework that captures such relations as interrelated triadic competition constellations.
Second, the perspective allows to analytically capture competing as something actors do. The focus on competing distinguishes our approach from recent positions in organizational sociology (Arora-Jonsson/Brunsson/Hasse 2021), which assume that competition cannot be understood as a specific form of action. Indeed, actors do not necessarily respond in a standardized way to a competitive situation. However, our analytical approach allows us to understand heterogeneous courses of action as competitive behavior. We propose both a general typology of practices of competition and a more specific typology of competitive organizational practices in higher education.
Third, the perspective allows to elaborate the central role of comparative valuation in com-petition, which has been largely overlooked in recent literature (e.g., again in Arora-Jonsson/Brunsson/Hasse 2021), and thus contributes to linking the sociology of competition on the one hand with the sociologies of valuation and comparison on the other.

0,"How has the so-called refugee crisis from 2015 changed German national identity? Literature on German national identity suggests various master themes of responsibility, ethnicity, and guilt. While many existing studies have focused on singular snapshots of German identity, few have paid attention to processes of identity change. Moreover, the consequences of the 2015 arrival of refugees for German national identity remain to be studied in detail. This paper explores this question of identity change in the face of crisis through a qualitative content analysis of the most widely read German newspapers - Die Zeit, Süddeutsche Zeitung and Bild - as well as elite speeches on important memorial occasions. We argue that 2015 can be understood as a critical juncture for German national identity as the arrival of immigrants challenges notions of identity, triggering (in)formal boundary-making. Material from the years 2014 and 2019 serves as two reference points for German national identity before and after the arrival of refugees. Based on an inductive analysis of 1790 articles and 25 speeches and the identification of several issue areas, we find that the representation of national identity shifted from a relatively homogenous understanding of Germanness in contrast to European neighbours in 2014 to an increasingly fragmented focus on Others within the country in 2019. Based on these insights, we propose a theoretical framework on mechanisms of identity change in the face of external crisis.",European University Institute,European University Institute,,,,,,,European University Institute,,Selma Kropp,Wolfgang Minatti,,,,,,,Selma Kropp,,Citizenship,Contentious Politics,Integration,National Identity,Immigration,Qualitative,Refugee,,Constitutional Patriots or Ethnic Nationals?

0,"Many judicial systems utilize a process, often known as a ‘referral’ process, in which one court has the ability to call upon another court, particularly a superior court, for definitive interpretations of law. This referral process is perhaps most widely known from its use in the European Court of Justice, which has long thrived on receiving referrals (known as preliminary references) from national courts within the European Union. Yet, the ECJ’s preliminary reference process is itself derived from the constitutional referral processes previously adopted in several national judiciaries of the EU member states, notably Germany and Italy. In this paper we examine the constitutional referral process at the national level, using data from the German Constitutional Court and interviews with court officials to test different theories of why lower ordinary courts refer cases to their national constitutional courts. There currently is a lack of theory and empirical data examining why lower ordinary courts choose to refer certain cases to the national or federal constitutional court.

Within this context we have seen the political (mis)representation of disabled people in parliaments abound – with a proliferation and decimation of images, narratives and discourses. Claims to represent disabled people abound, yet these claims reveal the ubiquity of institutionalised ableism in elected legislatures resulting from the historic and systematic exclusion of disabled people from politics as both the representative and the represented. Yet the parliamentary politics of disability remains largely misunderstood and systematically overlooked in research. This endures despite seismic shifts in political representation studies, most notably an increased interest in how claims to representation (mis)represent the very groups they purport to represent. This recent turn has engaged scholars from across a number of disciplines in extensive theoretical and empirical discussions on political representation – redefining what we understand by representation and how it should be studied. From these discussions, we have witnessed the emergence of the constructivist model of representation, which views representation as dynamic and contested process wherein divergent claims to representation compete against each other, in contrast to the traditional models, where representation is seen as the translation of fixed demands into measurable acts. The constructivist lens has become commonplace in studies examining the political representation of women, ethnic minorities, and other marginalised groups, but it has yet to be explored in relation to the representation of disabled people. This paper reviews the constructivist turn in political representation studies in relation to disability, and assesses how renewed interest in substantive representation, mostly notably the claims-making thesis, can help us study the political (mis)representation of disability. Following this discussion, an alternative framework for conceptualising and analysing political representation in relation to the specific context of disability is outlined, with the express aim of capturing and evaluating the complex, contested nature of claims to represent disabled people in parliamentary arenas.",Central European University,,,,,,,,Central European University,,Ruth Gazso-Candlish,,,,,,,,Ruth Gazso-Candlish,,Political Participation,Political Theory,Representation,Constructivism,,,,,Constructing disability in parliament: Extending the constructivist turn to the political representation of disabled people,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64749&EventID=185
0,"The misogynist incel (involuntary celibacy) movement has increasingly been linked to violent attacks. The male supremacist ideology has inspired several perpetrators of mass shootings in the US, Canada, Germany, and the UK. Conspiratorial thinking, hate speech, and detailed descriptions of gendered violence are popular themes for the incel movement active in online platforms such as in Reddit, 4chan, and 8chan as well as in their own Incels.is forum. In this presentation, I describe how identities of ‘us’ and ‘them’ are being constructed in Incels.is forum discussions.

Recent studies on extremism acknowledge the connection between online subcultures and extremist violence. Can incel ideology be defined as an extremist ideology? Current research on extremism shows that fundamentalist views of in-group (us) and out-group (them) form the basis of extremist identities (see. i.e. Berger, 2018). Therefore, to examine incel movement in the light of extremism it is crucial to understand the mechanisms of group identity formation in online spaces. What are the mechanisms shaping in-group and out-group identities for members in incel communities?

To learn how the identities of ‘us’ and ‘them’ and ultimately an extremist in-group identity are formed in Incels.is forum, a qualitative discourse analysis examining the dimensions and strategies of othering and group identity formation was conducted. The data covers a time period from November 2019 to May 2019 and includes over 200 comments attracting the most attention and replies in the forum.

Preliminary findings indicate that incels’ in-group identity is based on self-victimisation constructed through; 1) narratives of social and sexual exclusion, 2) images of misogyny, and 3) conspiratorial thinking. Out-group is described in dehumanising terms and violence against the outgroup is seen inevitable and as a prerequisite for incels to succeed in modern society.

0,"This paper qualitatively explores a conceptual approach for ex-ante construction and evaluation of alternate policy mix pathways. Advances in the analysis of single climate policy instruments and of policy mixes have been made in energy system modelling (Koller et al. 2021), in conceptual work (Axsen et al. 2020) and in empirical ex-post analyses (Koch et al. 2019; Anderson/Sallee 2017). Political science and innovation studies analyses offer broad conceptualizations of designing policy mixes and to enhance policy mix characteristics (Rogge and Reichardt 2016). However, a conceptualization of dynamic climate policy pathways that integrates insights from engineering, economic and political perspectives is still missing. This paper builds on recent conceptual work on policy mixes for light duty vehicles (Axsen et al. 2020; Bhardwaj et al. 2020), to develop a tool for policy mix pathway construction, by focusing on intertemporal challenges. A fundamental notion of our approach is that policy pathways need to evolve and change over time. Technological system transitions undergo different stages: emergence, diffusion and saturation (or re-configuration) of zero GHG technologies, and associated behavioural, normative, political, legal, economics and business transformations. Scholars have argued that policy mixes need to evolve in order to address the inter-temporal challenges associated with each of these phases, and to enable these complex processes to unfold within the very short time spans of envisaged net zero transitions (e.g. Kivimaa 2019). We suggest that the LDV transport sector in Germany is moving from the emergent phase into diffusion stage. Alternative low-carbon technologies such as BEV are becoming more broadly available at significantly reduced costs. This requires policy instruments which actively place pressure on existing polluting technologies to displace them, rather than simply supporting the emergence of clean alternatives (Kern and Kivimaa 2017). This requires implementing stringent pricing/taxation which makes polluting technologies more expensive to buy and use, or stringent regulation which actively phases-out polluting technologies. We use Germany as illustrative case in order to apply our concept, and we derive alternative policy mix pathways which can accelerate the rate of diffusion/transition and deliver substantial GHG abatement in this sector.

0,"Energy transitions require engagement with users, local communities and wider publics in order to be fair, acceptable and, ultimately, successful. The development of Smart Local Energy Systems (SLES) is a key component of the UK’s industrial strategy around decarbonisation. As such, SLES projects, characterised by the integration of low carbon generation, demand sources and smart technologies in a geographically-defined location, provide important contexts for public engagement. 
 
Drawing on interviews with partner organisations in SLES projects of different size and scale, this research investigates the targets, methods and rationales of engagement from the perspective of SLES projects. Findings indicate that SLES project partners engage a diversity of users and community actors around multiple energy systems facets, using a variety of methods. This diversity is not correlated with project size or scale. Engagement practices are rationalised by project partners through the articulation of imaginaries of users, as well as associated imaginaries of engagement deemed appropriate for these actors. Engagement practices are conditioned by SLES project contexts – namely the technological and infrastructural boundaries, place contexts, and partnerships of actors involved in engagement. Such project constraints are also shaped by the wider programme within which SLES projects take place. 
 
Diversities in engagement reveals potential areas of tension between SLES projects and sustainable energy transitions more widely, with important policy implications. First, projects which only engage publics in a narrow sense, e.g. with specific types of users, or around individual technologies risk missing an opportunity to engage people around broader policy objectives relating to local or indeed national energy systems. Second, there is a missed opportunity for systematic social learning between SLES projects about what forms of engagement ‘work’ in different contexts, which can inform future policy initiatives. Finally, there is a need to consider how SLES programmes can be used to enable public engagement in system change beyond the boundaries of individual projects, contributing to broader policy goals around sustainability and environmental improvements.",University of Exeter,University of Exeter,,,,,,,University of Exeter,,Patrick Devine-Wright,Iain Soutar,,,,,,,Iain Soutar,,Democratisation,Qualitative,Climate Change,Technology,Energy,Energy Policy,,,Constructing practices of engagement with users of Smart Local Energy System: comparing emergent UK case studies of state-led decentralised energy,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=66065&EventID=185
0,"Newly established courts are presented with challenges in decision-making. Among these challenges is their relative lacuna of obvious judicial precedents from which they should draw upon in the judgments. This raises questions about how new courts go about constructing a new body of jurisprudence and the extent to which they borrow from external jurisprudence or other sources of law. The creation of new international courts in the 1990s and 2000s offers researchers opportunities to understand how courts build judicial precedent. In this paper, I consider the link between borrowing and construction of precedent. What shapes court’s decision to borrow, and from what sources do they borrow or not? To examine this question, I rely on original data of citation practices of three new international courts—the African Court of Human and Peoples’ Rights, the East African Court of Justice, and the Caribbean Court of Justice. The citation practices of these three courts speak to several key issues. First, the distinction between national sources of law and international sources of law sheds light on how new international courts legitimate their decisions by signally respect for national sovereignty while also interpreting and applying international obligations to fulfil their mandates. Second, courts can borrow binding and non-binding sources of law. This distinction relates to if and how courts build precedent with an eye toward constructing jurisprudence that is coherent with broader legal norms but that also accommodates its unique political and legal context. Last, the paper maps if and how these courts shift from borrowing of external sources to more active reliance on their own precedents and jurisprudence. Overall, this paper seeks to understand the considerations new courts take when constructing precedent and how practices of borrowing address them.",The London School of Economics & Political Science,,,,,,,,The London School of Economics & Political Science,,Theresa Squatrito,,,,,,,,Theresa Squatrito,,Africa,Courts,Decision Making,,,,,,Constructing Precedent through Practices of Borrowing,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63209&EventID=185
0,"In this paper we claim that to increase biodiversity we need constructive conflict. Even though biodiversity loss is related to many debilitating conflicts, conflict is also a positive factor in realising changes in human behaviour that leads to biodiversity improvement. Starting from the idea that conflict is inevitable, this paper deals with the question of how we can use conflict in a constructive way in order to support social learning, trust-building and finding integrative solutions in the context of biodiversity restoration. As nature conservation and restoration policies typically follow socio-ecologically defined boundaries of landscapes, people with different stakes and perceptions are confronted with each other which often leads to conflicts. The challenge is how to deal with these conflicts. For this reason, we explore the concept of constructive conflict to develop an analytical framework for interaction processes around biodiversity restoration.  Here we place constructive conflict in between hot and cold conflict. Hot conflicts are interaction processes in which people try to convince or coerce their perspective over others, whereas in cold conflict differences are suppressed and not made explicit. In contrast, in a constructive conflict parties not only express their views, but also listen to those of others, are willing to reframe their views during a conflict, and are wary not to take a decision before new insights on the problem or its solution have emerged. Dealing with conflict in a constructive way requires balancing several dynamic tensions. For example, you need sufficient diversity in order to support learning process. There should be a balance in the level of diversity so different perspectives are expressed but people still understand each other.  In this paper we describe and illustrate several of these balancing acts by drawing on the literature of conflict studies, governance & planning, interdisciplinary cooperation and organization & management studies and our empirical research in the field of biodiversity restoration. To conclude, we reflect on the possibilities and limits of these balancing acts for constructive conflict, while taking into account existing power structures and the broader institutional setting in which nature conservation and restoration processes take place.",Radboud Universiteit Nijmegen,Radboud Universiteit Nijmegen,Radboud Universiteit Nijmegen,,,,,,Radboud Universiteit Nijmegen,,Sabine Baumgarten,Judith Floor,Pieter Zwaan,,,,,,Judith Floor,,Conflict,Conflict Resolution,Environmental Policy,Governance,Knowledge,Decision Making,Policy Change,,Constructive conflict for biodiversity,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63825&EventID=185
0,"Covid-19 and the government measures taken to combat the pandemic have fueled populist protests throughout Europe. Social media played a key role in the emergence of these protests. This study argues that the topic of Covid-19 has triggered populist user comments on Facebook pages of mass media in seven Western European countries (AT, DE, FR, IT, NL, UK, SE). It asks how reporting about the Covid-19 crisis, and real-world aspects of managing the crisis have affected the scope of populist commenting on Facebook. Drawing on media psychology, this paper theorizes populist comments as an expression of ‘reactance’, sparked by repeated ‘fear appeals’ in posts about Covid-19. Since reactance results from restrictions of personal freedoms, this paper expects an interaction effect of reporting about the government measures and the actual stringency of the measures, which varied considerably in the selected countries. The paper derives several hypotheses from these claims and test them on a dataset of N=65,343 Facebook posts, posted between January 2020 and June 2021 on 21 Facebook pages of mass media from in seven Western European countries (AT, DE, FR, IT, NL, UK, SE), and about 3.5 million corresponding user comments. Automated content analysis methods were used to measure populist communication in user comments and message characteristics of the posts. For measuring populism, the comments were first machine-translated into German using the Google Translate API to allow comparability of the measurements. Secondly, a fasttext word vector model was trained on the full corpus of German-speaking text used in this study. Finally, this study implemented a method called Distributed Dictionary Representations (Garten et al. 2018) which augments short conceptual dictionaries with word vector information to obtain a gradual measurement of populist communication. To classify the posts along several categories, such as mentioning the topic Covid-19, government measures, or public health experts, this study developed and applied language-specific dictionaries. All measurements were carefully validated against a human-coded gold standard of 300 comments and 300 posts per language, coded by thoroughly trained native speakers. The paper uses real world data provided by the Oxford government response tracker. Hypotheses are tested using carefully modeled multilevel regression models.

0,"A rich literature has revealed the consequences of issue shifts towards topics owned by niche parties in a cross-national context. So far, however, the processes leading to the ownership of certain topics have been mostly disregarded. In addition, the effect of issue shifts in the European Parliament have been much less understood, although the European Parliament has recently seen a dramatic rise of radical right and populist parties (RRPP). 
We address these research gaps by focusing on direct communications expressed on Twitter by all Members of the European Parliament between 2014 and 2019 (over 3 million Tweets). Moving beyond manifesto data, we, hence, utilize the huge repositories of social media in a quantitative manner to study the salience shifts of parties in reaction to niche competitors. Structural Topic Models allow us to explore empirically the issues RRPP occupy in the European Parliament and to trace their communicative behavior dynamically. In particular, we reveal which parties ""appeal broadly"", which issues are owned by PRRP and how other parties might adopt issues owned by RRPP. 
By using Negative Binomial Regressions, we then link the patterns of issue diversity and the level of issue salience to the outcomes of the European Parliament election in 2019. Our results show that communicating about topics owned by RRPP has indeed a positive effect on election results for mainstream and left-wing parties. Other than expected, this effect is not moderated by political ideology. Even more, we observe strong negative effects if RRPP concentrate on typical right-wing issues.
We therefore contribute to the literature on party competition and electoral success, issue competition and issue ownership in the European Parliament and add a new methodological approach to study these issues.",Universität Stuttgart,Universität Stuttgart,Universität Stuttgart,,,,,,Universität Stuttgart,,Raphael Heiberger,Uwe Remer,Sara Schmitt,,,,,,Sara Schmitt,,Elections,Political Competition,Political Parties,Populism,Party Systems,Political Ideology,Big Data,European Parliament,Contagious populist radical right: The role of issue salience for electoral success in the European Parliament.,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64251&EventID=185

Artists and curators engage democratic publics and set special standards of sociability. So much so that museums are no longer sites of casual cultural enlightenment but rather experiential contexts in which democratic publics realize that social mores are transient phenomena. The paper speculates on the meaning of facts and events like Ai Weiwei’s attempt to reframe the image of the drowned Syrian child Alan Kurdi by portraying himself in the identical pose of Alan’s corpse on a shore, creating a copy of the original, but a quasi-identical copy with very special properties, namely, an object of aesthetic investigation that finds in contemporary art museums a public space where it could resonate. For the fate of the original image would have been different, it would have resonated in the formless ether of social media for one week or two and then die down in people’s transient private memories.

0,"Tragedy has been the oldest and arguably the most popular form of art work since its origins in the ancient Greek. Although we possess only a few examples of the original four forms, as Aristotle explained in the Poetics, tragedy’s political character, which is inherent in the question of justice, is still very much alive and as relevant as it was two thousand years ago. Thus, perhaps changed in its forms of presentation, tragedy and its narrative structure are yet to shed light on our contemporary political impasses. 
Following this line of thought this paper is based on the main argument that underlying the origin of tragedy is always a political crisis, rise of Peisistratus and his tyranny in Athens, which inevitably causes a radical social disruption. Thus, the basic purpose of the tragic narrative is to make the audience to confront the primary unjust actions of the authority by putting them into shoes of the wrong-doer. The purpose is simple; revealing the fine line between the personal benefit and the public good and warning about the disastrous results of mistaking the former’s immediacy for the latter’s communal achievement. Following this main argument, then, it is possible to claim that the function of tragedy is still valid if we are to understand our contemporary political crisis. 
With this thought in mind, the paper claims that the analysis of the movies, although not literary works in form, The Killing of a Sacred Deer of Yorgos Lanthimos and The Salesman of Asghar Farhadi, as two examples of contemporary tragedies are not only intriguing due to their cinematic form, but also critical to provide us a venue to explore today’s political and social tensions and conflicts as well as quests for justice.",Middle East Technical University,Middle East Technical University,Ankara University,,,,,,Middle East Technical University,,Ömür Birler,Ömür Birler,Duygu Turk,,,,,,Ömür Birler,,Political Theory,Narratives,Normative Theory,Political Cultures,,,,,Contemporary Tragedies: A Political Glance to the Cinematic Works of Farhadi and Lanthimos,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64419&EventID=185
0,"Ample research documents an intense politicization of the issue of (forced) migration in recent years. For Germany, it has been argued that conflicts have sharpened in the course of the rapid increase of asylum applications from 2015 onwards. Yet, empirical evidence focuses on large protest events or migration-related protest dynamics at the national level. The local level of contention around migration has so far rarely been systematically assessed, and hence, comparisons of migration-related protests across different localities and over time within Germany are still missing. This gap is remarkable since life worlds in general and protest activity, in particular, are strongly influenced by everyday experiences and practices in the immediate spatial environment, where individuals are socialized into groups, embedded in social networks, develop identities and perceive social reality. Against this background, we present evidence on patterns of migration-related protest in two middle-sized German towns between 2014 and 2018. We explore the dynamics of migration-related protest over time, including the salience of migration in comparison to other issues of social conflict, the dynamics of protest pro and against migration, as well as the interaction patterns of the actors involved. We begin with a temporal analysis of 582 protest events identified in local newspaper sources. Empirical evidence suggests latency periods before and after a period of visible mobilization activity around the “summer of migration” in 2015 – yet with marked differences between the two cities when it comes to the differentiation of pro and anti-migrant protest activity. From a perspective conceptualizing collective action as (civil society) networks, we thus ask how this cycle of contention is related to the structures of interaction among actors in each city. To do so, we collected the digital public communication (around 76,000 homepage posts, Facebook posts, and Tweets) of those actors who were involved in migration-related protests between 2014 and 2018 in each city. With that, we assume that digital platforms are essential tools of (interorganizational) political communication that render interaction patterns and thus social structure visible. We employ a comparative social network analysis based on these actors’ interactions in the periods before, during, and after visible mobilization activity (N = 877 references). This mixed-methods approach allows us to assess not only if and how the “summer of migration” 2015 has affected local conflict dynamics, but also if this supposed “critical juncture” in recent German history has lastingly modified the relational patterns of civil society in these two localities.",German Centre for Integration and Migration Research (DeZIM),University of Copenhagen,Freie Universität Berlin,,,,,,German Centre for Integration and Migration Research (DeZIM),,Elias Steinhilper,Matthias Hoffmann,Moritz Sommer,,,,,,Elias Steinhilper,,Migration,Social Movements,Social Media,Mixed Methods,Mobilisation,,,,"Contested Hospitality: Comparing local Dynamics of migration-related Protest before, during and after the “Summer of Migration” 2015 in Germany",https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65936&EventID=185
0,"Observing dynamics of contention and conflict in citizen participation processes challenges the assumption that practices of participatory democracy may ever fulfill the promise of an ‘inclusive consensus’. Contention and conflict in citizen participation remind us of the fallibility and indeterminacy/undecidability of democratic practices. In this respect, contention and conflict in the framework of citizen participation may constitute a vital challenge to ‘post-political’ practices threatening to reduce democratic participation to institutional dispositives and routinised choreografies of consensus mobilization. As agonism is the defining dimension of the political, contention and conflict are a necessary dimension of democratic politics and a key to reclaiming the emancipatory potential of politics.

However, the hypothesis of conflict happening ‘by default’ needs to be qualified. Observing the contentious dimension of citizen participation – the idea that “citizen participation could be understood as the quintessential example of conflicts by default” – reflects a significant empirical reality and resonates with a theoretical understanding of ‘the political’ as ontologically rooted in difference and agonism. At the same time, it poses a distinctive research challenge, as neither the emergence and dynamics nor the trajectories and transformative outcomes of conflicts can be defined deductively or deterministically. In fact, bridging theoretical perspectives and empirical analysis of conflicts represents a multidimensional and interdisciplinary challenge for research and analysis.

This paper addresses this challenge through an interpretive approach, based on combining post-foundationalist political theory with research on social contention and mobilization and with interpretive policy analysis. A social science perspective centered on social agency and the way actors attach meaning to social practices within a specific policy field is thus integrated with a post-foundational perspective on politics as a dialectics of hegemonic practices. This combined approach enables, on the one hand, to analyse the conditions for contention and conflict to emerge and develop in terms of the discursive and symbolic-cognitive practices of collective meaning-making involved in the expression of agonistic claims and of the forms of social mobilization and collective action by which agonistic claims are expressed. On the other hand, it enables to explore the capacity of social agency to (dis-/re)articulate a given policy situation and of transforming it into a new configuration through agonistic struggles. Contention and conflict are hence seen as expression of agonistic claims through processes of collective meaning-making, moments of collective identity formation, and the formation of new political subjectivities. Contention and conflict thus intended are emergent, interactive-relational, and co-evolutive phenomena which develop within specific socio-spatial fields of meaningful social practices, challenging and possibly generating alternatives to such socio-spatial practices.

The paper is intended as a tentative framing of the topic in view of the development of a research framework. Based on empirical observation of recent struggles in the field of urban policy in Berlin, it explores how contention and conflict in participatory practices – and the contestation itself of participatory politics – manifest themselves and develop in three distinctive fields of socio-spatial practice:
- challenging ‘invited’ forms of participation,
- addressing insurgent practices of ‘invented’ participation,
- contesting the ‘meta-politics’ of citizen participation.",Technische Universität Berlin,,,,,,,,Technische Universität Berlin,,Enrico Gualini,,,,,,,,Enrico Gualini,,Citizenship,Conflict,Contentious Politics,Democratisation,Critical Theory,,,,Contested participation:  Understanding agonistic struggles in the field of participatory urban policy,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65011&EventID=185
0,"The Covid-19 crisis put under stress the EU member states capacity to tackle the shortcomings created by the pandemic and called also into question the EU capacity to act autonomously and timely in order to deploy a coordinated and effective response. Differently from the past crises, the EU has launched a new instrument of cross-national solidarity, the Next Generation EU, to cope with the severe socio-economic consequences of the pandemic. Previous studies have framed the EU leaders’ strategy that has led to the approbation of the Next Generation EU as a choice of polity maintenance, that is the attempt to safeguards the integrity and the effectiveness of the supranational political system. But what have been the reaction of antisystem and Eurosceptic actors about this effort for strengthening fiscal solidarity?

0,"This research seeks to understand how various conceptions of sovereignty are contested in liminal settings (Loh and Heiskanen 2020), i.e., in territories whose statehood is not acknowledged internally or externally (Visoka 2018). The chosen case studies are Northern Kosovo and the Åland Islands, neither of which can be considered as states per se, but both of which perform differing discourses on sovereignty and autonomy. Northern Kosovo is a case of overlapping statehood of both Serbia and Kosovo (Vulović 2020), and the Åland Islands is an autonomous region of Finland with close ties to Sweden. Northern Kosovo is examined as a case of performative sovereignty in non-democratic settings, while the Åland Islands can be considered a democracy. The aim is to answer how sovereignty discourses are performed in these contrasting settings and investigate the different actors who perform them. Looking at past referendums and formal and informal challenges to institutional routines in both contexts, as well as the erection of barricades by local elites with the support of organized crime in Northern Kosovo, the article also seeks to answer how an array of local actors challenge, contest and reinterpret hegemonic discourses on sovereignty.
Theoretically, this article combines performative statehood theory (Grzybowski and Koskenniemi 2015; Neumann and Sending 2021; Visoka 2018; 2019; Vulović 2020) with sovereignty research that understands the body as the performative locus of sovereign power (Agamben 1998; Bernstein 2012; Hansen 2005; Hansen and Stepputat 2005; 2006; Jagannathan and Rai 2015). This can be termed performative sovereignty. Here, sovereignty is understood as “a tentative and always emergent form of authority grounded in violence that is performed and designed to generate loyalty, fear, and legitimacy from the neighborhood to the summit of the state” (Hansen and Stepputat 2006, 297). Relying on Agamben (1998), sovereignty is not just about violence, but also about the production of a political order based on practices of exclusion. With this in mind, the article’s empirical focus is on individual actors that embody sovereign authority, who cannot be considered state actors in the traditional sense: regional assemblies, local political and economic elites, shady businessmen, organized crime, as well as average citizens who, out of fear or political persuasion, support these elites and perform their discourses. By conducting ethnographic fieldwork in local communities in Northern Kosovo and the Åland Islands, as well as interviews with local elites, and media analysis, I aim to shed light onto sovereignty performances as everyday practices of authority through both violence and exclusion from the political order. These performances, in turn, have tangible effects on how contested territories are governed, reinforcing their position of liminality.",University of Helsinki,,,,,,,,University of Helsinki,,Marina Vulovic,,,,,,,,Marina Vulovic,,Europe (Central and Eastern),Conflict,Local Government,Organised Crime,Comparative Perspective,,,,Contesting Sovereignties in Northern Kosovo and the Åland Islands,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63573&EventID=185

Using an original dataset of about 2 million contributions to this public debate in six countries (Australia, Germany, Lebanon, Switzerland, Turkey, and the USA) and in three types of media (printed newspapers, news websites, and political blogs), we examine the sociocultural and technological antecedents of inclusion and justification in public debate. 
We show how the democratic institutions (majoritarian versus consensus) and degree of cultural division (stable versus contested secularism) in a country shape whose voices get heard and how much public justification of public policy occurs. We also show how the shift from traditional to online debate impacts public discussion of intractable social problems and the significance of the transition towards a greater importance of user-driven opinionated discourse in public debate. 
In sum, this paper identifies the degree to which the sociocultural and technological contexts produce specific assemblages of actors, political positions, and justificatory practices in mediated public debate.

0,"Some authors, analyzing the Brazilian political and economic crisis that led to the impeachment of Dilma Rousseff, pointed to republican actions (anti-corruption) of the former president that would have impacted the support of the parties of the so-called “centrão” (parliamentary super majority formed by physiological parties) to the ruling coalition. We seek to analyze these actions in depth using the cases of the Ministry of Mines and Energy, the Ministry of Transport and the state oil company Petrobras, focusing specifically on the relationship between political parties and the big contractors. We did this based on three categories of analysis: political and technical appointments of bureaucrats to public office, schemes between the legal and the illegal to undermine competition in public contracts, and bureaucratic and political circulation of contractors. We used the plea bargains and investigations within the scope of Car Wash Operation, triangulating testimonies and documents. The results indicate historical changes in the relationship between the State and contractors from 2012 onwards, which changed appointments, cartel operation and anti-competition schemes before the start of the Car Wash Operation.

0,"For several decades, Belgium has been engaged in a twofold process of institutional transformation, combining federalization and Europeanization. The transfer of competencies to the regions and communities requires them to develop new political and administrative governance mechanisms that may or may not support European projects. This chapter analyzes two distinct moments of institutional reform: the takeover of science policy by the two large communities (in 1989) and the organization of the transfer of family allowance policy (2014). In the first case, the aim is to include scientific policies in the dynamics of the knowledge-based Europe in support of the extension of the intellectual property market; in the second, to restructure a social policy in order to (re)define the modalities specific to the welfare state, despite the pressure of budgetary austerity principles. In both cases, Flanders and Wallonia show very different trajectories in the development of new policies and administrative arrangements.
We propose to compare these developments in the two regions by asking how they do fit the expansion of ""neoliberal"" governmentality in one or both regions? One of the characteristics of a neoliberalization process would be an extension of market (or quasi-market) relations into parts of society or sectors of the state that were previously untouched by them. The creation of market structures is not a natural fact but a state fact, a recomposition of the state's modes of action (Bezes, 2009). In other words, the State itself reinvents its functioning and its technology of governement to support the expansion of the market logic (as in the case of intellectual property), that is, the production in a logic of competitive selection of decontextualized and mobile objects whose competitive qualities are made legible. In this context, it is then a question for the researchers of highlighting the rationality of government that is reflected in the bureaucratic power mechanisms (Foucault 2004) and underline how they favor the logic of the market to the whole of society and generalize an economic rationality to instruct and manage public action (Dardot and Laval, 2010).  
The analysis of the singular trajectories of neo-liberalization traced by these two federated entities when they seized new competencies highlights the transformation of the repertoires of public administration and public action in the sectors analyzed. The question that motivates us is therefore the following: how are the new policies put in place through the action of administrative vehicles in the process of formation and what are the knowledge networks mobilized to establish their political rationality? What are the interplays between the bureaucratic power mechanisms and the political orientations of the governments in the two regions for two policy sectors.",Université de Liège,,,,,,,,Université de Liège,,Catherine Fallon,,,,,,,,Catherine Fallon,,Governance,Public Administration,Regionalism,Qualitative Comparative Analysis,,,,,"Contrasting administrative capacities as forms of neoliberalism in the two main regions of Belgium, Flandre et en Wallonie",https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65952&EventID=185
0,"Against arguments made on Marxism as a Eurocentric and determinist theory and methodology that is unable to offer avenues for peoples from the Global South, there is increasing effort to shed light on the contributions made by these very peoples in developing Marxism in their own diverse contexts. From Latin America and the Caribbean to Asia and Africa, political theorization was and still is a strategic endeavor of national liberation from colonization and neocolonization, for envisioning emancipatory avenues towards decolonized futures. Addressing questions such as racism and racial subjugation, religion, culture, nation and nationalism, and self-determination, intellectuals, party cadres and social leaders have drawn on Marx and Engels’ own writings and widened the scope of the critique of colonialism as a regime working to expand capitalism world-wide, including in its imperialist stage, unveiling the pervasive effects of such a regime in contemporary societies. This paper engages with some of these works by outlining a synthesis of tactical and strategic analyses made by these thinkers as contributions to political theory. Like others, the paper argues that these contributions deserve recognition and inclusion in the scholarly register —not only as research subjects but as efforts of political theorization in their own right.",University of Coimbra,,,,,,,,University of Coimbra,,Moara Assis Crivelente,,,,,,,,Moara Assis Crivelente,,Nationalism,Marxism,Political Activism,Capitalism,,,,,"Contributions from ""Southern Marxisms"" and National Liberation Struggles to Political Theory",https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64229&EventID=185
0,"The past decades have seen a veritable explosion of public authorities – at the national, regional and international organization level – implementing Corporate Sustainability Policies (CSPs) in an effort to lead firms towards “profit with purpose”. As widespread coverage of COP26 in Glasgow underscored, there is an increasing expectation that public policies are capable of steering business towards sustainability. The logic being that CSPs, whether taking the form of binding legislation or voluntary guidelines, function as blueprints for firms to follow, and specifying practices by which firms must act (e.g., disclosure requirements). Despite increased public CSP activity, and expectation, there is a paucity of systematic research testing whether public policies have, so far, been effective in achieving their aim; studies tend to examine more proximate determinants of firm strategy, on one hand, and the making and diffusion of public policy, on the other. In this paper, we bring together the full transmission chain, from public policy to firm strategy, to offer a novel analysis of when, how and to what extent public CSPs affect firms’ own sustainability communications, reporting activities and business strategies. We do this by using novel methods in natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) to measure text-reuse: the extent to which text from public CSP documents (e.g., the UN Global Compact) gets copied into firms’ own communications, reports, and sustainability strategy documents. Our analysis draws on a novel database of nearly 1500 CSPs over a 60-year time period from around the globe and a stratified random sample of over 750 firms (the largest cap firms from each of six world regions as well as the world’s most “woke” firms). In addition to identifying which firms adopt which public CSP language the most, we assess when firms tend to copy more CSPs into their own sustainability documents. Our argument is that firms tend to copy more CSP language when they face pronounced and public reputational issues around their own negative environmental, governance and social impacts. We measure these reputational issues using firm-level RepRisk data (which monitors global media sources to flag firms’ ESG risks and violations that have specific reputational, compliance, and financial impacts for the firm) and then test our argument using statistical analyses. Our results show that firms, in no small measure, rush to upgrade their sustainability strategies and communications by coping existing public CSP guidelines when faced with public reputational crises.",Kings College London,Kings College London,,,,,,,Kings College London,,Adam Chalmers,Robyn Klingler-Vidra,,,,,,,Adam Chalmers,,Environmental Policy,Regulation,Business,Climate Change,Big Data,,,,"Copenhagen, Glasgow, Paris and beyond: do regulations affect firms’ sustainability strategies?",https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64423&EventID=185
0,"Among the former Soviet Republics, Estonia together with the other two Baltic countries is an example of successful democratic consolidation. Yet, the last decade in Estonian politics has been shaped by an anti-political-establishment surge on both sides of the political specturm, which brought a conservative-populist party into government and is set to launch a liberal-technocratic newcomer, Estonia 200, into parliament as one of the most popular parties. This anti-establishment challenge has not undermined democratic political competition but has in a sense rather strengthened it. The current paper traces how this upheaval has unfolded in Estonian political discourse through an analysis of the entire media and parliamentary discourse from 2007 to 2022. 

The parliamentary elections in 2011 resulted in a four-party parliament instead of the usual six and the right-liberal Reform Party, which had been a member of every coalition since 1999, established almost a quasi-hegemonic position – no government coalition was possible without its participation, and it was in a position to dictate the terms of all government policy. 

In parallel to this concentration of power, public discontent began to visibly accumulate. By the elections in 2015, two protest parties – a moderate conservate Estonian Free Party and a populist-conservative Estonian Conservative People’s Party (EKRE) had established themselves and entered parliament. The former failed to endure, while the latter managed to triple its support by the 2019 elections and was included in a government coalition, which lasted until the beginning of 2021. 

This surge of populism, in part, triggered a liberal-technocratic counter-reaction in the form of Estonia 200, an entirely new party that was established a year before the 2019 elections. Even though they failed to enter parliament in 2019, three years later Estonia 200 is competing with EKRE over the position of the most popular party.

The current paper will give an account of how this transformation manifested itself in Estonian political discourse both in media and in parliament from 2007 to 2022. For this end, first, an almost complete media corpus for that period has been collected, which contains all content of the three major daily newspapers as well as the public broadcasting company (~3.5 million articles). Second, all parliamentary transcripts have been collected for the same period. Together, these two corpora cover almost the entire public political discourse in the country over almost four electoral cycles (except for social media). 

The analysis will trace the emergence of and counter-reactions to populism using supervised (classification of sentiment and populist speech) and unsupervised (topic modelling using word embedding and transformer-based models) machine learning techniques. As such, it will provide a unique overview of how the emergence and normalisation of populism has transformed the public political discourse in Estonia in terms of the range of issues that stand out and the level of emotionality of political discourse, while the democratic functioning of the political system as a whole and the basic democratic institutions that uphold democracy have, at least until now, held in place.",University of Tartu,,,,,,,,University of Tartu,,Martin Mölder,,,,,,,,Martin Mölder,,Media,Parliaments,Populism,Quantitative,Big Data,,,,Coping with an Anti-Establishment Surge Across the Political Spectrum: the Case of Estonia,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65296&EventID=185
0,"Decarbonisation efforts are forcing rapid whole-systems transitions in carbon-intensive regions. Local economies built up around coal, oil and gas are experiencing systemic disruptions in employment, and also in related social relationships, identities and institutions. In the face of this disruption, actors are coping with change in different ways. The “coping strategies” pursued by different actors depend upon who they are, the capacities that they have available to them, and the context in which they are embedded. However, in these situations, identities, capacities and contexts are in flux. 
This contribution present findings from a global inventory cataloguing the coping strategies that actors undertake in response to decarbonisation efforts in carbon-intensive regions. Our analysis examines how decarbonisation is (re)shaping who is considered “elite” and how elite power is being exercised in ways that can either support or hinder overall decarbonisation. Coping strategies in the inventory are characterised according to who is doing the coping, how the action (or non-action) is targeted, and what is being pursued. 
In order to determine who is coping, we make use of Avelino and Wittmayer’s ((2016) Multi-actor Perspective to classify actors as individuals, organisations or sectors who can operate at different levels, using different business models. To identify how the action is targeted, we build upon Axsen and Kurani’s (2012) typology of intended benefits. This is a matrix of actions intended to benefit either private interests or the collective, and characterised as either functional (i.e. things people “do”) or symbolic (i.e. things people “say”). To account for the contribution to decarbonisation, strategies are further classified as “supporting” or “hindering” of decarbonisation efforts. To classify what is being pursued, we group outcomes into broad categories (e.g. social, political) based on Sovacool et al (2020). We also note whether strategies are intended to adapt to changing conditions, resist changes, or if they try to modify or transform conditions (O’Brien 2012), and the intended timescale of impact.
Results, still preliminary at this point, reveal that early in transitions, elites with national and supranational reach usually resist change and try to prolong investment in fossil fuels. As transitions progress, these policy and business elites tend to support strategies that perpetuate the structural conditions associated with status quo institutional and socioeconomic conditions, through adaptive strategies that replace or compensate for carbon-intensive activities with lower carbon industrial activity (e.g. renewables installations, retraining workers for other industrial sectors). However, there are some elite actors, mostly at supra- and subnational scales who support transformative strategies that are more disruptive, but that better address injustices associated with the transition process (e.g. the development of local government-owned renewables installations; the establishment of energy communities).
The connections we map across actors, will help enhance our understanding of how different actions are emerging, and the ways in which equitable, socially sustainable approaches to decarbonisation can be best supported.",University of Sussex,,,,,,,,University of Sussex,,Roberto Cantoni,,,,,,,,Roberto Cantoni,,Energy Policy,Policy-Making,Transitional justice,,,,,,Coping with decarbonisation: the impact of elite power constellations on social responses to low carbon transitions,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65045&EventID=185
0,"The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a steep decline in demand for infrastructure lending by countries currently struggling to cope with its economic effects. Instead, the past two years have seen a steep rise in demands for COVID-recovery lending. This has presented a significant challenge to the newly established Asia Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), which focuses exclusively on infrastructure lending. The new bank faced various struggles from its inception, including US contestation and hesitancy by European partners to join its membership, as well as significant competition due to institutional overlap with the World Bank and the Asia Development Bank. Only a few years after its establishment, the pandemic has made matters worse for the AIIB. With its project pipelines focusing mainly on infrastructure lending, the fall in demand for infrastructure borrowing was bad news for the AIIB. This paper examines the strategies employed by the AIIB and its leadership to adapt to
the COVID-19 pandemic. As the findings suggest, the AIIB consciously engaged in collaborative partnerships with the World Bank to rely on the latter's more extensive project pipelines. This gave the AIIB access to World Bank lending projects with various clients interested in COVID-recovery and extended its lending operations beyond the infrastructure sector. By partnering up with the World Bank, the AIIB not only ensured continuity in its project stream but has also been able to gain expertise in recovery-plan lending necessary for evolving its own project pipeline. Finally, as a young institution with less credibility than its competitors, the AIIB has managed to improve its legitimacy in the eyes of stakeholders and clients through its partnerships with the World Bank, which have effectively given it the ""legitimacy stamp"". These findings are especially relevant to the IR literature on institutional overlap and regime complexity, where these factors are often argued to result in competition
and rivalry amongst IOs that share policy domains. In contrast to that conventional wisdom, the analysis in this paper showcases how institutional overlap has been a driver for cooperation between the World Bank and the AIIB, providing them with the opportunity to achieve interorganizational synergy when it comes to COVID-recovery lending in the Asia-Pacific. The analysis relies mainly on original data from 20+ interviews with AIIB, World Bank, and state officials as well as experts in the field.",Maastricht Universiteit,,,,,,,,Maastricht Universiteit,,Giuseppe Zaccaria,,,,,,,,Giuseppe Zaccaria,,Asia,Governance,Institutions,Global,World Bank,,,,Coping with the pandemic together: How the AIIB adapted to the COVID-19 challenge by cooperating with the World Bank,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63387&EventID=185
0,"In 1998 MoveOn pioneered a new and powerful form of digitally-enabled, multi-issue, member-driven, rapid response, advocacy organization. This model quickly spread around the world as other progressive activists emulated it in Australia (GetUp!), Germany (Campact) and in over a dozen other countries. These digital advocacy organizations are all united around common progressive values, and have been influential actors in national elections, and in public debate on a range of issues from the Iraq War to free trade agreements. Here we ask: Have right-wing groups also sought to copy this new digital advocacy organization’ model? And if so, how successful have they been? Drawing on the existing literature we identify three potential accounts for why the right might, or might not emulate the left on-line: 1) supply and demand; 2) ideological differences; and 3) transnational diffusion networks. We then examine four right-wing ""copycat” organizations - Grassfire, Advance Australia, Patriot Petition, and CitizenGo. We find that all four organizations are rapid-response, multi-issue on-line campaigning organizations, however none appear to be fully-member driven in their funding or decision-making. Rather these organizations seem to favour hierarchical top-down decision-making, as this is more compatible with norms on the right. Overall, this paper illustrates how some elements of an organizational model may diffuse from the left to the right of the political spectrum, but not others.",Johns Hopkins University,Freie Universität Berlin,Freie Universität Berlin,,,,,,Freie Universität Berlin,,Nina Hall,Annett Heft,Michael Vaughan,,,,,,Michael Vaughan,,Civil Society,Contentious Politics,Cyber Politics,Interest Groups,Internet,,,,Copycats: Does the Right Emulate the Left's Digital Advocacy Organizations?,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63853&EventID=185
0,"The paper investigates the utilisation of the coronavirus crisis by the Eurosceptic leaders in Visegrad Group (VG) counties. Our main argument is that the pandemic crisis reshaped and reinforced the Eurosceptic narrative frames in the region in two ways. First, as part of the ongoing polycrisis, it has contributed to maintaining Euroscepticism as a major and mainstream political narrative on the European Union. Second, it has helped to find new policy areas enriching the Eurosceptic arguments and vocabulary, such as Schengen cooperation, where the local leaders are attacking the mainstream policies of the European Union, using, e.g. securitising rhetorical strategies or blaming to frame the COVID crisis in Eurosceptic tone.
The VG countries are not the only examples of similar Eurosceptic discursive treatment of pandemic crisis, yet they represent an excellent research sample for our analysis. The VG countries have reinforced Eurosceptic narratives in the course of the European polycrisis, finally yet importantly, due to illiberal leadership predominant in the region. Therefore, considering the path dependence established in the period of polycrisis, we could expect a more evident manifestation of the trends mentioned above.
The paper explores analyses and compares the Eurosceptic narratives at the peak of the coronavirus crisis 2020-2021. We will analyse different texts produced by the selected politicians, such as official press releases, interviews, statements, or other longer and more profound pieces of communication produced by them since March 2020 (outbreak of the crisis in the region) and fall 2021 (termination of the delta mutation wave in the region). We will analyse the documents through the lens of narrative analysis. We prefer the analysis of narratives over discourse analysis since the latter is more suited to assessing individual actors’ discursive practices. A study of narratives was selected because it emphasises understanding the content and the discourse priorities expressed by the political actors.
We focus on the main actors dealing with the pandemic crisis, which means the prime ministers of VG countries. Czechia, Hungary, Poland, and Slovakia are parliamentary democracies. It means that both executive treatment and political communication of pandemic crisis are vested in the governments’ hands.",Masaryk University,Masaryk University,,,,,,,Masaryk University,,Vit Hloušek,Pavla Hosnedlová,,,,,,,Pavla Hosnedlová,,Europe (Central and Eastern),Democracy,Political Leadership,Euroscepticism,Narratives,,,,Coronavirus as a source of Eurosceptic narratives: Evidence from Central Eastern Europe,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63700&EventID=185
0,"Foreign agencies have been more actively sharing the resource burden of global investigations. In December 2016, Brazilian firms agreed to pay a record-setting penalty of over $3.5 billion to resolve a bribery case involving American, Brazilian and Swiss authorities. While it is difficult to deny the success of anti-corruption efforts represented by national and global corruption investigations, it is at the same time easy to realize that when such investigations involve significant politicians, several interest groups engage in an advocacy work consisting on politicizing a technical and complex issue, involving not only the Executive, but also the Judiciary and Legislative Branches. What is the role of mainstream/social media, fake news, prosecutors, and judges in such politicization of corruption investigations, and how all these players can influence the electorate in contexts of institutional crises and change political landscapes? This paper addresses these issues in the countries involved in the Car Wash/Jet Wash/“Lava Jato” case based on investigations derived from the aforementioned agreement before the U.S. DOJ, the Office of the Attorney General of Switzerland – OAG, and the Brazilian Federal Public Prosecution Office – MPF (Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Guatemala, Mexico, Panama, Peru, and Venezuela) in a comparative exercise with the aim of contributing to policy and legal decisions that could prevent politicization from affecting the corruption investigations, and at least mitigate the effects of such politicization over other fundamental (democratic) institutions. Finally, 5 years after the agreement, it seems important to analyze the Brazilian Supreme Court (STF) decisions that have addressed the allegations that the Car Wash/Jet Wash/“Lava Jato” investigations were politicized. As the Car Wash did influence other investigations in Latin America, it is expected that case law analyses about the STF trade-offs between anti-corruption measures and due process of law can be a contribution to comparative legal policy-oriented literature.","University of Michigan, Ann Arbor",,,,,,,,"University of Michigan, Ann Arbor",,Denis Guimaraes,,,,,,,,Denis Guimaraes,,Latin America,Corruption,Judicialisation,Policy Change,Policy Implementation,,,,"Corruption Investigations, Politicization, and Institutional Crises?

0,"Powerful alliances for social change become more urgent in times of multiple crises. Currently, authoritarian, patriarchal, racist, classist, and (hetero-)sexist patterns continue to gain momentum. However, in a world of intersectional oppression, it remains difficult to forge alliances demanding common demands and collective actions. It becomes even more difficult when we consider the different positions of power and domination from where we articulate and practice resistance. These (im)possibilities of intersectional alliances are still widely discussed in critical gender studies, black, and (queer-) feminist theory. 
The paper, thus, focuses on everyday life experience in which alliances can be forged. It does so through the lenses of hegemony theory to bring a currently underrated tool of critical analysis back into the discussion on intersectionality. Following feminist political scientist Brigitte Bargetz (2016), I argue that everyday life has an ambivalent role in the struggle for intersectional alliances. On the one hand, everyday life solidifies domination and, therefore, prevents intersectional alliances that emphasize interconnectedness and commonality in oppression. On the other hand, everyday life also provides possibilities for emancipatory resistance. However, does everyday life enable intersectional alliances? I will show in my paper that the answer depends on the way stories and the positions from where they are told in everyday life. With Antonio Gramsci (2012) and the feminist re-readings of Gundula Ludwig (2011), I understand stories as Common Sense [ital. Senso Comune] because they tell us what is normal, and thus without alternative, in certain societies at certain times and about which social consensus prevails. 
Common Sense represents a powerful instrument in the struggle of societal forces, which makes collective action (im)possible on an everyday basis: I will argue in a first step, that Common Sense as a ""single story"" (Adichie 2009) of consent to hegemonic positions, and privileges, makes intersectional alliances (almost) impossible. I will argue in a second step, that, contrastingly, Common Sense can offer the potential to enable fertile ground for intersectional alliances under certain conditions. I refer here to Gramsci's philosophy of praxis and feminist re-readings of counterhegemonic Common Sense (cf. Sara Ahmed 2021) to show that there are a lot of stories in the counter-archive telling of intersectionality. Therefore, stories do not only stabilize hegemony but can tell different stories, stories of difference that can be told from manifold positions.",Westfälische Wilhelms-Universität Münster,,,,,,,,Westfälische Wilhelms-Universität Münster,,Henrike Bloemen,,,,,,,,Henrike Bloemen,,Gender,Political Theory,Knowledge,Feminism,Narratives,Power,,,Counterhegemonic Storytelling: The Ambivalence of Common Sense in Intersectional Alliances,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64686&EventID=185
0,"Court-executive relations have been conflictive in many Latin American countries in the last decades. The independence of highest courts is frequently contested through formal and informal political interferences when courts take decisions contrary to government interests. 
 
During the pandemic, executives have been implementing protection measures against the spread of the virus that curtailed individual rights or that resulted in conflicts of competences between different levels of government. For example, court-executive relations in Brazil and El Salvador, where populist presidents Bolsonaro and Bukele reacted with public attacks to rulings from the highest courts, drew a lot of attention. In Brazil, the Supremo Tribunal Federal (STF) maintained its power to control a hostile executive unwilling to implement the necessary measures to fight the pandemic. On the contrary, in El Salvador, the conflict between the executive and the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court increased during the pandemic and, lastly, ended with the destitution of four judges.  
 
This paper starts with an overview of the court-executive relations among the region in the last decade. Then, it undertakes the first regional mapping of these relations during the pandemic, on pandemic-related court decisions and the respective government reactions. We discuss exemplary cases of court interventions in three areas: the protection of individual rights, the control of executive decrees on emergency measures and the arbitration of conflicts between different levels of government.

0,"In recent years, many countries experienced an increased support for far-right populists whose ideology clashes with central tenets of liberal democracy. As part of these developments, counter-majoritarian institutions such as high courts and independent judiciaries have come under intense pressure from populist actors who regard them as illegitimate restrictions on the presumed will of the people. Where populists entered governments, e.g. in Hungary or Poland, populist attacks paved the way for institutional reforms that led to a systematic erosion of judicial independence. The literature has acknowledged the threat posed by these trends and explained how and why populist rebuild the institutional order once in power; however, scholars have so far largely neglected to analyse the relationship between populism and courts in cases where populist parties are in opposition or lack the necessary majorities for sweeping reforms. This paper proposes a more holistic engagement with populist attacks on high courts. We argue that populists engage in different strategies depending on their strength and governing status. In particular, we focus on strategies of delegitimization directed against court decisions, judges and the concept of judicial review that are employed when populist parties are not in a position to effect institutional change. Thereby, populists in opposition particularly benefit from the rise and use of social media, allowing them to circumvent the gate-keeping role of traditional journalism. We illustrate our arguments using empirical evidence from tweets of politicians from Germany, the Netherlands, Poland and the United Kingdom.",Universität Hannover,Universität Hannover,Universität Hannover,Universität Hannover,Universität Hannover,,,,Universität Hannover,,Christoph Hönnige,Merle Huber,Merle Huber,Philipp Koeker,Dominic Nyhuis,,,,Philipp Koeker,,Democracy,Populism,Courts,Social Media,,,,,Courts under pressure: How populists seek to delegitimize independent judiciaries using social media,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64145&EventID=185
0,"This paper starts with an analysis of the healthcare policy process in the context of the different COVID 19 waves in France. It can be characterized by the key role of presidential authority, especially during the first wave. The main decisions were taken by the Sanitary Defence Council directly headed by Emmanuel Macron and announced by him. The President also launched a scientific council directly working for the Executive. This centralization of the decision process, reinforcing the presidentialization of the French political system, has led to a strong politicization of the COVID 19 policy issues and to a bypassing of the programmatic group: the “welfare elite”, a narrow group of senior civil servants, characterized by a specialized career path in the Social Security administration, which holds a key position in the healthcare policy process since the end of the 20th century (Genieys, Hassenteufel, 2015). Their policy change program has been heavily contested in the context of the COVID 19 pandemic, especially in the hospital sector with the lack of intensive care beds shedding the light on the negative effects of strict budgetary constraint on healthcare provision. The organization of a large discussion forum with the main stakeholders in June 2020 (“Ségur de la Santé”) has led to the adoption of different policy measures: the reopening of hospitals beds, recruitment of healthcare workers and medical staff, wage increase hospitals (especially for nurses) and the weakening of managerial power in hospitals (Hassenteufel, 2020). Therefore the COVID 19 pandemic seems to play the role of a focusing event (Kingdon 1984, Birkland, 1997), punctuating the established policy equilibrium (Baumgartner, Jones, 1993) in French healthcare policies. The paper will discuss this interpretation by shedding the light on previous changes in these policies, especially the elaboration of a new policy program oriented towards the reorganization of healthcare provision based on territorialization and new modes of coordination. It is strongly related to the agenda setting of the issue of “medical deserts” (Hassenteufel et al., 2020), and the growing involvement of elected local authorities in healthcare issues, reinforced by the COVID 19 crisis. The paper analyzes the policy actors involved in the shaping of this policy change program which are related to the “welfare elite” and how they try to make a strategic use of the current crisis in order to push it forward, in new institutions created before the crises, especially the regional health (state) agencies (ARS). Finally, we stress that the French programmatic elite in healthcare policies has been able to maintain its position in the policy process, especially in policy implementation, in the context of the COVID 19 crisis and therefore to pursue the new reform path initiated before.",The University Paris-Saclay Graduate School for Sociology and Political Science,,,,,,,,The University Paris-Saclay Graduate School for Sociology and Political Science,,Patrick Hassenteufel,,,,,,,,Patrick Hassenteufel,,Elites,Executives,Interest Groups,Local Government,Policy Analysis,Public Policy,Welfare State,Policy-Making,COVID 19 and the healthcare policy process in France: between presidentialization and programmatic reform path,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65777&EventID=185

For the covid-19 increasing the global poverty rate from 7.8 to 9.1 percent; 163 million more are living on less than $5.50 a day (World bank 2021). Poorer countries are contending with a deeper, longer-lasting crisis that has increased global poverty and is reversing recent trends of shrinking inequality. It is not possible to quantify the effect on global inequality yet, but simulations suggest that an increase of just 1% in within-country inequality would result in 32 million people living on less than $1.90 a day in 2021 and increase the gap between the income growth of the bottom and top 40 percent to 4 percent from 2.7 percent with no change in within-country inequality. Those who lost income due to the pandemic have been almost twice as likely to spend down assets or savings, leaving them less able to cope with continued or recurrent income losses. They have also been 57 percent more likely to go a full day without eating, which carries serious long-term consequences for cognitive and physical development when experienced among children. It is also estimated that covid-19 could lead to an aggregate loss of between 0.3 and 0.9 years of schooling, with poorer families the most impacted. Corona virus made their life more difficult.

0,"As Covid-19 hit Syria after a decade of protracted conflict, the fragmentation of the territory and governance system prevented the adoption of a national strategy to mitigate the impact of the pandemic. In Idlib governorate, Covid-19 highlighted the inability of the Syrian Salvation government to offer effective alternatives to the Syrian regime. While it failed to provide healthcare and social services and to corner the international aid market, international aid routes were blocked by al-Assad’s regime in an attempt to squeeze the opposition further. In this context, local civil society in northwest Syria emerged as another non-state agent of governance – with a focus on providing healthcare and social services – in Idlib. Based on 73 in-depth interviews conducted between June 2020 and April 2021 across Idlib governorate, this article exposes and interrogates the tensions in the political and humanitarian space between restrictions – in the case of the international community and opposition government – and transformation – namely that of local civil society.",University of Edinburgh,,,,,,,,University of Edinburgh,,Juline Beaujouan,,,,,,,,Juline Beaujouan,,Civil Society,Conflict,Governance,,,,,,"Covid-19 and Alternative Governance Systems of in Idlib, Syria",https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63090&EventID=185
0,"The Covid-19 outbreak has legitimised governments around the world to ban national rallies and demonstrations under the label of the health emergency. This measure, however, sounds rather sneaky in those regimes characterised by a vacillating rule of law and facing socio-political grievances during a revolution or after the fall of a decade-long authoritarian regime. This article sheds light on two case studies, Tunisia and Algeria, which have been hit very hard by the pandemic in the last two years and have witnessed increasing restrictions on civil liberties in times of profound political changes.  Based on semi-structured interviews with civil society activists mobilising in the two different countries and the document analysis of national authorities’ securitization strategies, this article focuses on the following research questions: How has the pandemic transformed the political opportunities of civil society and social movements in two countries characterised by a revolutionary process - the Hirak movement in Algeria and a bumpy democratization process in Tunisia? In other words, how have power relations between national authorities and their internal opponents changed in two countries classified as a faltering democracy (Tunisia) and a hybrid regime (Algeria) after the outbreak of the pandemic? More broadly speaking, how the reconfiguration of power relations given by the pandemic, including the countries turning in on themselves, has affected the state of democratisation in the two countries? By answering these questions, this article sits at the intersection of the literature on contentious politics and democratization studies.

It argues that, in general, social approaches are a good fit to the phenomenon of populism, as they capture the social dynamics that animate populist parties. To support this claim, first I point at the wider political and socio-economic context that abutted the contemporary emergence of populism in Europe and the types of grievances mobilized by populists. Second, I examine two types of existing social responses to populism: the social politics of Mouffe and Berman, and the social policies put forward by Galston and Mounk. After highlighting the problems with each of them, thirdly, I develop a distinct integrationist theory of democratic defence inspired by the Weimar-era theorist Hermann Heller. Its two central premises are that (1) extreme parties should be included because they channel distinct social concerns, and (2) social inclusion is the key to creating citizens loyal to the democratic project. The article ends by suggesting relevant measures that range from ensuring socially even political representation to effacing existential insecurities and promoting a non-patronizing type of cultural integration.",Uppsala Universitet,,,,,,,,Uppsala Universitet,,Anthoula Malkopoulou,,,,,,,,Anthoula Malkopoulou,,Democracy,Political Theory,Populism,,,,,,An integrationist approach to democratic defence,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65133&EventID=185
0,"The literature on interest groups and voluntary associations’ participation in policy processer is rather fragmented and most often focusing on a limited number of variables. The aim of this paper is to contribute to the development of a more comprehensive analytical framework for the study of how interest groups and voluntary associations’ try, and manage, to influence public policies. How are interest groups and voluntary organizations activated in public policy processes? To what degree do they get access to and participate in the process? What influence do they get in the making and implementation of public policies?  
Hopefully, the analytical framework will enable researchers to make more thoroughly thought through selections of variables for both comparative and single case studies. The framework will include and discuss various interrelated dimensions and subdimensions such as:
Political system: Concentration of public and private power; executive-legislative relations (presidential vs. parliamentarian, type of parliaments and governments).
Policy process: Stages in the policy cycle; decision streams; sector policies.
Actors and interactions: Public authorities (elected bodies, civil service, level of government); media (traditional, social media, party press); political parties (government – opposition, relationship with interest groups/voluntary associations);
Interest groups/voluntary associations: Attributes (membership, field of operation; goals, purpose); resources (number of members, financial resources, expertise); political strategies (mobilize members, media, lobby parliament or civil service, corporatist representation, framing/arguing)
Political impact: Influence (on actions and activities (of MPs, civil service etc.); final decision of policy); consequences (public authorities get access to information, legitimation, specialist interest and strong groups get too much influence).",University of Stavanger,Universitetet i Bergen,,,,,,,Universitetet i Bergen,,Hilmar Rommetvedt,Kristin Strømsnes,,,,,,,Kristin Strømsnes,,Civil Society,Interest Groups,Parliaments,Public Policy,Comparative Perspective,Influence,Policy-Making,,Analysing interest groups and voluntary associations in the policy processes,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63237&EventID=185
0,"Agricultural policy has generated empirical evidence for theoretical developments in political science in many cases over the years. In particular, research on the EU’s Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) has provided important insights to explain how policy instruments are chosen to achieve changing policy goals, highlighting, e.g., policy networks, path dependency, or policy paradigms. An important aspect that has received limited consideration in the CAP literature is that instruments are not merely tools to achieve contingent objectives, but also bearers of information about political interactions. Following a political sociology perspective, policy instruments “reveal a (fairly explicit) theorisation of the relationship between the governing and the governed” (Lascoumes & Le Gales, 2007, p. 11). They constitute a “condensed form of knowledge about social control and ways of exercising it” (ibid.).

In this research, we examine shifting ideas of social control underlying policy instruments, using the implementation of the CAP 2023 to 2027 in Germany as an example. Since 1992, a series of CAP reforms have added sustainability-related instruments and objectives. However, rather than effectively addressing challenges such as environmental degradation or animal welfare, they primarily sustain the exceptionalist legacy of farm income support. By examining the CAP from a political sociology perspective, Grant (2010) has shown how policy changes can be explained by the exhaustion and long-term contradictions of instruments that in the 1990s were no longer in tune with broader political trends. Internal contradictions and external pressures combined led to a substantial change away from price support towards direct income transfers. More than a decade after Grant’s analysis, it is time to re-assess the role of CAP’s internal contradictions and external pressures, given the enormous challenges reflected e.g. in the European Green Deal.

We ask what the CAP instruments tell about the governing of transition and transformation challenges. Based on a qualitative content analysis of the legislative texts for the CAP 2023-2027 and its implementation in Germany, we reconstruct the implicit theories of social control underlying the changing policy instruments in the CAP. The recent reform introduced a ""new delivery model"" that requires member states to link all instruments – including income support measures – to specific objectives, and explain the intervention mechanism. While this reflects external pressures to legitimize the CAP, it also betrays shifting theories of social control. New instruments e.g. Eco Schemes, Social Conditionality or animal-related interventions indicate that long-established income transfers are increasingly linked socially desired outcomes. The new governance arrangement expands public authorities’ and taxpayers’ ways to control farming practices. This in turn reflects broader changes in human-nature, human-animal and human-human relationships, the rise of the environmental state and Shifts in EU relations with its member states.  

By using the example of the CAP and reconstructing the shifting theories of social control implicit in its policy instruments, this research adds to previous understandings of policy instruments’ role in transition and transformation processes by adding a more nuanced understanding of the location and the functioning of power relations in the CAP, and in policy mixes in general.",Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin,Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin,,,,,,,Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin,,Peter H.

0,"Andrei Platonov (1899-1951) is probably the most fascinating author of the early Soviet Union. Though his most important novels were banned during his lifetime (eg. Chevengur & the Pit), he was still able to publish and was appreciated by all his colleagues. Both Nobel Prize winners in literature, Boris Pasternak and Mikhail Sholokhov, as well as Ilya Ehrenburg and Konstantin Simonov signed his obituary. Furthermore, he was in close contact with Georg Lukács, who also spoke up for him. As Andrei Platonov comes from a poor proletarian background he participated in the civil war and became later an engineer focused on irrigation. In the second World war he served as a War correspondent. Thus, it is not surprising that he portrayed himself as a proletarian and communist throughout his life. Given that Maxim Gorky wrote to him personally that he recognises his talent but do not know how to evaluate his work, the difficulty of his classification is hardly surprising. His work is still little known outside the former USSR, even though he is usually counted among the most important literary figures in the Soviet Union. 
Since the end of the Soviet Union, the discussion of him is dominated by a literary studies perspective. Indeed, his aesthetics are astonishing since Andrei Platonov pursued the enterprise of a new proletarian language. But it obscures the view of the exciting political-theoretical reflections on the emergence and early days of the Soviet Union. 
A main problem in dealing with his work is not only his special language, but that an understanding of his theoretical reflections presupposes a knowledge of materialist theory that goes beyond basics. Furthermore, his thought is ciphered due to the literary form. However, this is a general problem in the study of political theory in literature. In my paper, I will therefore first look at the complex ciphering in Andrei Platonov's work to be able to unfold the central aspect of his reflections: the human condition and his chains before and after the revolution. In his novel Tschwengur, he finally shows that the project of the ""new man"" is by no means easy, if not bordering on madness. Through his consistently empathetic examination of the human condition, he confronts several problems that faced the young Soviet Union. For example, in his novella Dzhan or the First Socialist Tragedy, he addresses the problem of the developmental contrasts between the European and Central Asian parts of the young state and the have-nots of the Russian tsarist empire. Based on this insight, I will use his particular and pioneering concept of labour and practice to arrive at a rationale, that can be developed with his work, for why the USSR failed. While some of these insights may not seem new from a contemporary perspective, the social sciences were still in their infancy at the time they were written (especially in the 1930s). From the perspective of the history of ideas, however, Platonov remains remarkable.","Universität Rostock, Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences, Institute of Political Science",,,,,,,,"Universität Rostock, Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences, Institute of Political Science",,Valerian Thielicke,,,,,,,,Valerian Thielicke,,Europe (Central and Eastern),Political Theory,Critical Theory,Marxism,Neo-Marxism,,,,Andrei Platonov and the conundrum of the human condition,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63285&EventID=185
0,"Among advanced industrial countries, the United States is conventionally understood as a benchmark for state-society relations under neoliberal capitalism, whereby minimal state involvement is the default preference. Nowhere does this reality seem more apparent than in the politics of US healthcare, where the government has mandated, over the last decade, expanded access to a predominantly privatized health insurance system through the Affordable Care Act (ACA). To counteract the unequal access of private healthcare, the ACA originally mandated: 1) the creation of state-based healthcare exchanges, with an eye to affordable, fair healthcare for those without employer-based plans, and 2) the expansion of Medicaid eligibility for those earning up to 133 percent of the Federal poverty line. Medicaid, a federally-subsidized, state-administered program for those in poverty, has met with the most state-level resistance, often demonized as another unnecessary and intrusive government intervention. Indeed, following a Supreme Court decision in 2012 that struck down this Federal mandate, 12 US states continue to decline participation in the ACA expansion, and a range of states have sought waivers that allow deviation from federal Medicaid guidelines.
In the context of grossly unequal access to healthcare in the US (30 million still uninsured and up to 44 million under-insured), as well as the devastating effects of the COVID pandemic across marginalized populations, scholarly explorations into public healthcare programs like Medicaid take on a special urgency. This paper will explore the unique and peculiar nature of Medicaid as a ‘public’ policy objective within the terrain of US political economy. Medicaid makes up some 18 percent of overall US healthcare expenditures, a figure that has grown by 10 percentage points since the Reagan administration. However, any cursory review of state Medicaid calls into question its purely public nature. In fact, the strong majority of states which have entered the ACA’s Medicaid expansion also utilize alternative delivery program, increasingly squeezing out public, single-payer, fee-for-service government medical insurance. Private, for-profit managed care organizations (MCOs), as mediating agencies, have grown from a minority position in state plans to almost three-quarters of all Medicaid delivery in 38 states, plus DC. Arguably, MCOs have proliferated across state programs to such an extent that beneficiaries’ recognition of the public origin of their health funding has been largely obscured.
In this sense, Medicaid appears to fit the model of what I have elsewhere referred to as ‘adaptive accumulation’, wherein private actors execute public state functions under pre-arranged, publicly-funded payment structures. They do so not only with an eye to stable, publicly-derived profit streams, but also under the legitimizing guise of public duty. For their part, state governments recognize the opportunity not only to stabilize budgets, which are often highly constrained at the state level, but also actively to reorient government function, tapping into a large swath of political culture that sees governmental activity as inherently inefficient and wasteful. Ultimately, Medicaid appears as one more instance in which the US version of neoliberalism enjoins the use of corporate America, but also paradoxically more—not less—government intervention.",York University,,,,,,,,York University,,Rodney Loeppky,,,,,,,,Rodney Loeppky,,Federalism,Policy Analysis,Political Economy,USA,,,,,Another Not-So-Public Program: US Medicaid and Adaptive Accumulation,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65840&EventID=185
0,"Anti-intellectualism in civic culture
The concept of civic culture tends to put citizenship in the center of democratic polity. The concept of citizenship often implies rational calculation of risks and benefits as a crucial stimulus of civic activities. From such assumptions it is easy to It assumes that articulation of interests must be based on certain usable pool of knowledge available to individual citizens and to the organizations which represent/transmit their interests versus the decision making bodies. Yet more often than not such implied rationality of politics is questioned when we observe and analyze the developments in the public sphere. Most of critical approaches to political rationality direct us into the study of values and emotions as determinants of human behavior at least equal to reason in their significance. What the study of populism has revealed is the existence of yet another driving force of human behavior – anti-intellectualism. AI (pun intended) bridges the spheres of reason and emotions in a marriage of convenience. It is a form of political consciousness which embraces a peculiar type of logic that mixes rationality and emotions in a powerful populistic package challenging the establishment, elites, experts, knowledge but unlike classic populism does not turn against the dominant institutions of the system and its normative foundations. Instead anti-intellectualism offers a revised reading of the practices and institutions by offering their new interpretation.

0,"Envisioning the future through Robert Rosen's theory of anticipation draws attention to the function of the system in order to achieve its desired state (Rosen 1985). The theory is considered as a novel approach to visioning futures, the present state and the past, arousing interest in a variety of scientific disciplines. At the heart of anticipation is envisioning, as well as consciously affecting the change towards the desired future, which connects the theory firmly with the fields of governance and decision-making.
In this paper, anticipation is considered as a recent approach to futures studies that is expected to add value to the development of value deliberation within decision-making. The paper elaborates deliberative democracy practices and citizens’ future perspectives in the spirit of late Mika Mannermaa, who already in the 1980s understood the significance of the community in observing our future (Mannermaa 1988: 287–288):
“But what is even more important to notice is that this ‘anticipatory possibility’ belongs to everyone in a society. The complexity view thus emphasizes the role of individuals, groups, movements, nations, etc., in ‘making their future’ much more explicitly than the traditional scenario thinking. Of crucial importance is that futures research in this process should have a clearly emancipatory interest of knowledge, i.e., it should help people to free themselves from old lines of thought and to create new ideas (and in this way to make ‘impossible’ into possible).”
Public policy related to sustainable development debate is an example of expectations for the future that strongly reflect the underlying societal values. Values are often associated with the responsibility of present decisions for future generations. However, in the context of scientific research on the energy transition, societal values have been approached at most as cultural factors, without an element of social vision. Increasing participation and citizen’s perspective in the discussion is not straightforward in the field of futures studies, traditionally focused on expert assessment. Nevertheless, the paper suggests that without utilizing the deliberation, the process of anticipation – as presented in Rosen’s theory of anticipation – is incomplete.","University of Vaasa, Finland",,,,,,,,"University of Vaasa, Finland",,Hanna-Kaisa Pernaa,,,,,,,,Hanna-Kaisa Pernaa,,Democracy,Green Politics,Political Participation,Normative Theory,,,,,Anticipating the future through deliberation,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63817&EventID=185
0,"“The great victory of the Vietnamese people at Dien Bien Phu,” Frantz Fanon said in his 1961 book Les Damnés de la Terre, “is no longer, strictly speaking, a Vietnamese victory.” Like Fanon, many anticolonialists around the world expressed jubilation at the astonishing Vietnamese military victory over France at the battle of Dien Bien Phu in 1954, ending nearly a century of French colonialism in Vietnam (1858-1954). Yet, outside of recent scholarship on Vietnamese history, few know that Vietnamese revolutionaries were in those years also struggling against an internal opponent—Vietnamese landlords—during the “land reform campaign” (1952-1955) and that this struggle did not produce clear victory but “mistakes,” “excesses,” and wrongful persecutions that leaders of the campaign later publicly admitted to. During the fallout of the land reform, shortly after victory at Dien Bien Phu, anticolonial thinkers published essays in two journals—Nhan Van (Masterpieces) and Giai Pham (Humanities)—that criticized their leaders for a lack of democracy, freedom of speech, and human rights, and called for liberal reforms. This period of public criticism is known as the Nhan Van Giai Pham movement (NVGP) (1955-1960). Drawing on these writings, this essay shows how Vietnamese anticolonial thinkers articulated internal political challenges facing them and their comrades in the new post-colonial communist state in northern Vietnam. Specifically, this essay explores how they sought to answer a question that persists for anticolonialists around the globe: how to create lasting freedom after expelling the colonizers? While it is easy to admire how the Vietnamese forged unified resistance and a sense of collective duty that paved the way to Dien Bien Phu, it is less obvious how to interpret the fraying of unity, demand for individual rights, and disenchantment expressed in the NVGP for the aim of decolonization, not only in 1950s Vietnam but also globally and in the long term. Fanon asked, “What must be done to bring about another Dien Bien Phu?” This essay focuses on another, equally important, question— “What must be done to avoid the need for a Nhan Van Giai Pham?” —and shows how Vietnamese anticolonial revolutionaries have answered it.",Gettysburg College,,,,,,,,Gettysburg College,,Kevin Pham,,,,,,,,Kevin Pham,,Nationalism,Political Theory,Social Justice,Transitional States,Global,Marxism,Transitional justice,,Anticolonial Jubilation and Postcolonial Disenchantment:  Vietnamese Political Thought and the Nhan Van Giai Pham Movement,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63912&EventID=185
0,"One of the most dominant axioma’s in political science is the collective action problem. This refers to a situation when those who benefit from public resources do not pay for them. In lobbying research this refers to a situation where some organizations spend actual resources on lobbying, while other organizations may still profit from these efforts without doing any work. While a dominant theory, there are no actual empirical studies confirming or rejecting this mechanism. That is, studies do not disentangle whether organizations which lobby (more) than others are more satisfied with the outcome of the lobby efforts compare to organizations which do less or nothing at all. In other words, we do not know to what extent organizations can free ride on the success of other organizations. In this paper we set out to analyze exactly this: is there are a difference between organizations which indicate to have lobbied and influenced policymakers and organizations which indicate to have not been influential at all or have not even bothered to lobby? We answer this question based on a unique survey among interest group leaders regarding Covid policies across 9 countries in Europe. The survey asks about the strategies, influence, and satisfaction with specific Covid policies across the countries in two waves: one directly after the outbreak of the pandemic in 2020 and one a year later in 2021. Our data collection strategy is uniquely structured to answer this question because – first – we approached organization based on a bottom-up sample of interest organizations. This means we have both active lobbyist and free riders in our sample. Second, we asked organizations about both the influence they had on lobby outcomes as well as their satisfaction with policy outcomes. Combined this allows us to test whether organizations are more satisfied with lobby outcomes if they were actively engaged in lobbying and/or were successful in doing so.  Our results are important for theory development in the field of collective action problems as well as for more specified studies focusing on the sources of influence of interest organizations.",University of Amsterdam,University of Copenhagen,,,,,,,University of Copenhagen,,Marcel Hanegraaff,Wiebke Marie Junk,,,,,,,Wiebke Marie Junk,,Interest Groups,Public Policy,Quantitative,Lobbying,Mobilisation,Policy Change,Survey Research,Influence,Are active lobbyists more satisfied with policy outcomes than free riders?

0,"Today, the party democracy model faces a number of challenges: citizens do not trust parliament (Catterberg and Moreno, 2006), voter turnout is declining (Gray and Caul, 2000; Blais, Gidengil, and Nevitte, 2004), and the role of political parties as intermediaries between the citizens and the authorities is weakening (Dalton and Wattenberg, 2002; Dalton, 2004). Meanwhile, independent local lists have been successful in local elections in various countries (Otjes, 2018; Drápalová and Vampa, 2018). Local independent lists compete with political parties for political representation in local governments. This article addresses one of the critical questions in the scholarly literature on local independent lists: whether and how local independent lists are different from the local branches of traditional political parties in municipal councils (An Heyerick, 2016). This paper uses data from Lithuanian municipal councils to investigate whether and how members of independent lists behave differently from members of political parties at council meetings. 

To explain the behaviour of politicians in representative institutions, researchers typically analyze politicians' personal goals and institutional and electoral rules. In this study, the main factor explaining the different behaviour of politicians is the form of organization to which they belong. Since the same electoral rules apply to political parties and independent lists in the Lithuanian local election, the country is suitable for exploring the relationship between the type of organization and the behaviour of council members. Local independent lists have been allowed to nominate candidates for municipal councils in the country since 2015. In addition, it is assumed that members of political parties and independent lists pursue the same objectives (re-election, personal career and policy implementation). 

Based on previous research, I predict that membership of different forms of organization (independent lists and political parties) leads to the different behaviour of councillors in the municipal council. I hypothesize that members of independent lists are more likely to vote against their group and the ruling coalition (opposition); they speak more often and for longer in council meetings than party members. The dataset consists of one year (2019-2020) of coded municipal council meetings in three Lithuanian municipalities.",Vilnius University,,,,,,,,Vilnius University,,Jogilė Ulinskaitė,,,,,,,,Jogilė Ulinskaitė,,Local Government,Party Members,Voting Behaviour,,,,,,Are local independent lists different from political parties in municipal councils?

0,"Recent research has increasingly acknowledged the important role of the resistance to shifting gender relations for the radical right backlash. However, few studies have attempted to single out and systematically assess how dynamics of women's increasing power affect attitudes and voting behavior among both men and women. On top of that, there is a lack of research causally testing these relations. 
This paper applies a survey experiment to address this gap and causally identify whether gender resentment plays an independent role in the radical right backlash. It does so by investigating whether the increasing political representation of women evokes a social status threat among men. Conversely, it assesses whether women express societal discontent about persisting inequality and how perspectives of future status gains affect their attitudes and political behavior. 
The priming experiment was fielded in an original online survey in Germany in January 2022. It manipulates how strong shifts towards more female representation in parliament appear to respondents. The results show that gendered political power relations and their trajectories influence respondents' social status and perceptions of political deprivation. For men, priming the topic of women in politics led to more negative evaluations of their future standing and political power. However, these negative evaluations did not translate into higher radical right voting propensities. This result highlights the importance of paying more attention to the political reactions of status winners, as the effects on voting propensities among women – in favor of Green parties – were stronger than among men.",University of Zurich,,,,,,,,University of Zurich,,Magdalena Breyer,,,,,,,,Magdalena Breyer,,Extremism,Gender,Public Opinion,Survey Experiments,Voting Behaviour,,,,Are Shifting Gender Relations Perceived as a Social Status Threat?

0,"This paper seeks to assess the extent of political polarization in Europe in the last two decades, utilizing a novel measurement of mass political polarization applied to European Social Survey data. The main aim is to describe the developments of ideological polarization in Europe across time, polities and opinion dimensions. A secondary aim is to develop a more theoretically grounded measurement of polarization, based on  DiMaggio, Evans and Bryson's (1996) seminal definition, while also departing from it in some important respects. 

While the concept of polarization has been extensively studied in recent years, it “appears not as one concept but many” (Bramson et al., 2017) even when considering only a qualified definition (i.e. mass ideological polarization). I argue that polarization should conceptually be understood as being about closeness to an in-group, as well as distance to out-groups, for the individual. In this spirit, I measure polarization as the extent to which opinions are dispersed and the extent to which variation in opinions is explained by party choice (i.e. sorted), as a multiplicative index. This conceptualization departs from other proposals such as polarization as (solely) dispersion, extremism, or sorting (Oscarsson et al., 2021)While these concepts are useful for describing characteristics of a (ideological) distribution, I argue that they are not the correct ways to identify ideological polarization. 

The results suggest that polarization varies significantly across European polities, and as a point of comparison, the US is not an outlier in this respect compared to the European countries. The general picture of change is that polarization has not increased, while a slight increase of polarization on immigration-related attitudes can be seen from 2014 to today.

0,"Democratic innovations have blossomed in recent years as part of attempts to avert a democratic malaise. Attention of scholars has focussed on devices that aim to augment public consultation by further democratising their processes of recruitment, deliberation, and decision-making. Many of these deliberative processes aim to elicit considered judgements through collective reasoning of a diverse group of citizens. A key challenge is ensuring inclusion and equality of voice for participants while integrating expertise. Can existing and emerging technologies help rather than hinder this process? In computer science and related fields work on argument mining, mapping and reasoning has developed tools for identifying, mapping and interpreting argument structures and disagreements as they emerge. There are at least two potential uses of these tools in democratic innovation: First by classifying and mapping arguments we can develop visual presentations of the structure of a discussion and the key components of arguments. Such a tool can then be used to reduce redundancy, neatly structure discussion around support for claims, and expose unstated assumptions. Secondly, techniques can be used to identify signals or predictors of anti-democratic modes of speech allowing early intervention in discussions. The potential for computational linguistics to enhance political deliberation among citizens remains mostly untapped. In this paper we report on work carried out in partnership with city councils in England where these techniques were applied to existing consultation processes. We gathered data through a combination of quantitative measures of actor behaviour and interviews with stakeholders. We assess the extent to which using tools of argumentation in public consultation affects transparency, learning, inclusion, deliberation, and decision making itself.",University of Southampton,University of Southampton,University of Southampton,University of Southampton,University of Southampton,,,,University of Southampton,,Paolo Spada,Matthew Ryan,Timothy Norman,Rafael Mestre,Masood Gheasi,,,,Paolo Spada,,Cyber Politics,Democracy,Decision Making,,,,,,Argument Mapping in Public Consultation,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64886&EventID=185

0,"Between 1996 and 2021, Brazil created eleven autonomous regulatory agencies at the federal level.
Despite the expansion of the model over this 25-year period, literature hasfor the most part described
a perennial state of instability surrounding them. Critics contend that the Brazilian regulatory agencies
were strained to the limit especially during left-wing presidential administrations, from early 2003 to
mid-2016. A hostile attitude coming from the Executive would have compromised agencies’ autonomy
and performance, putting the whole model permanently at risk. We empirically question this
assumption through a longitudinal quantitative analysis based on a novel budgetary dataset. Overall,
our findings show rising budgetary trends across all the four budget categories that we report on,
suggesting a process of continuous institutional embedding even if formal administrative autonomy
was not secured. The article’s main contribution lies precisely in unravelling new ways in which de
facto autonomy can develop, allowing also for a more nuanced understanding of the level of

0,"Although significant controversy in the political science literature has crystalised around the question of interest group influence in policy processes, scholars focus mainly on policy influence. Studies analysing IGs’ agenda-setting influence are scarce due to difficulties inherent in conceptualizing and operationalizing the abstract concept. The purpose of this research note is to stimulate further research on the extent to which groups can affect the process of political agenda-setting. First, it proposes a typology of agenda-setting influence which considers instances of both pushing a ‘dream’ issue on the agenda and blocking a ‘nightmare’ issue off the agenda. Second, I outline the methodological challenges associated with identifying and empirically studying cases in which an issue was kept off the agenda and suggest ways to overcome them. Finally, I discuss common approaches for gauging groups’ policy influence to detect opportunities for operationalizing agenda-setting influence. Two operationalizations are distinguished for large-N studies: an assessment of attributed agenda-setting influence and an evaluation of whether groups’ attained their preferences vis-à-vis the political prioritization of an issue.

0,"Contemporary societies are becoming increasingly polarized along socio-political lines. Unsurprisingly, social scientists’ attention to it has grown exponentially over the past decade. However, as it often happens with buzzwords, the notion of “polarization” is becoming increasingly heterogeneous and fuzzy, being applied to an ever wider set of related yet distinct empirical phenomena. In fact, clarity in definitions and empirical operationalizations is often missing, thus hampering knowledge accumulation.

This article proposes a network-analytic structural approach for the study of what is arguably the least studied polarization-related phenomena: interactional polarization. The aim is to theoretically and empirically distinguish a truly “polarized” social setting from other possible structural scenarios, as well as to identify different pathways leading towards it. This would add much needed precision to the study of the severity, causes and consequences of polarization an enable longitudinal and cross-section comparisons. We propose a new analytical framework that simultaneously assesses three crucial dimensions: composition, homophily and structural topography. Based upon this framework, we set out a novel classification of 10 ideal-type network structures, including an ideal “polarized network”. The latter requires the concurrence of (i) high diversity (i.e. distant positions/attitudes), (ii) strong homophily (i.e. preference to establish and/or maintain social interactions with those alike), and (iii) a marked community structure (i.e. presence of subgroups that are more densely connected internally than with the rest of the networks). Furthermore, the article reviews specific procedures and metrics for the assessment of each dimension and discusses potential empirical applications for both socio-centric and ego-centric approaches.",Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona,Autonomous University of Barcelona,,,,,,,Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona,,Alejandro Ciordia Morandeira,Miranda Lubbers,,,,,,,Alejandro Ciordia Morandeira,,Cleavages,Political Methodology,Political Participation,Political Sociology,Political Engagement,Political Ideology,Empirical,,"Assessing polarization in relational terms: diversity, homophily and communities",https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65327&EventID=185

It is aimed to identify issues related to understanding and interpretation of words and phrasing used in a survey question. Also, it helps to identify issues related to memory retrieval (i.e., memory erosion), rationale and decision making when determining an answer, and assessing how respondents map their thinking into response categories. The International Social Survey Programme (ISSP) is developing a new survey module (National Identity and Citizenship) which covers a variety of relevant topics, including questions on populism. These questions will be fielded across the globe by ISSP members. The USA team conducted a cognitive test on newly designed question on populism, covering topics such as: will of people, people vs. politicians, inaction of politicians, political compromise, perception of people by politicians, political elitism, perception of economic policy.

0,"Previous scholarship has been concerned about regulatory authorities’ weak democratic and legitimacy deficits. At the same time, scholars identified increasing democratic qualities, such as participation and inclusiveness, that confer power to external actors. This paper tests these arguments utilizing a novel comprehensive database on the democratic qualities of regulatory authorities covering 47 regulatory agencies in nine European countries over three different regulatory sectors: data protection, food safety and the financial sector. This database offers a unique opportunity to assess institutional designs in a systematic and quantitative way. In the paper we describe the indicators utilized to measure the legal obligations and the actual performance of four democratic qualities: transparency, participation, accountability and inclusiveness and two additional control variables: political independence and managerial autonomy. We then explore variations between agencies to investigate whether higher levels of political independence and managerial autonomy are correlated with more democratic qualities.

0,"The literature on the growth effects of populism remains inconclusive. This is due to severe methodological difficulties mostly driven by country heterogeneity and because of the difficulty in conceptualising populism. In this paper, we try to overcome the limitation by looking at the Hungarian example, chosen as a representative example of right-wing populist rhetoric in Europe with consistent data availability. The paper approaches this problem in two parts, following some of the most recent trends in policy evaluation. In the first part, it quantitatively analyses Hungary’s Prime Minister’s public speeches and different Eurostat indicators. The analysis shows a disconnection between implemented policymaking and logical economic and political threats. Overall, we see that the Hungarian democratic transition is impeded by societal fears and by some real problems in knowing the policies that would fully foster this transition. This creates in turn a sense of urgency that is compensated by a strong leader that uses it to foster cronyism and neo-feudalism. In the second and deductive part, the paper uses the Synthetic Control Method (SCM) of Abadie et al. (2010) to give quantitative substance to this hypothesis. It constructs a counterfactual for Hungary between 2010 and 2019 with countries with similar political and economic characteristics. We find that growth effects from populist rhetoric are negative. We estimate that without populist rhetoric and policymaking, per capita incomes would have been, on average, approximately 10% higher over the selected period.",Corvinus University of Budapest,,,,,,,,Corvinus University of Budapest,,Elena Cossu,,,,,,,,Elena Cossu,,Political Economy,Populism,Quantitative,Policy-Making,,,,,Assessing the economic performance of a government characterised by populist rhetoric in Hungary: A synthetic control approach,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63072&EventID=185
0,"Citizen participation in policymaking is often said to stem from a need to educate citizens in politics (normative), to control government (liberal), or to increase support for government decisions (instrumental) (Pedersen & Johannsen, 2016). Even though citizen participation in policymaking has grown in the last decades, civil society organisations remain essential in established democracies (Foley & Edwards, 1996). Civil society significantly contributes to influence policy and hold policymakers accountable, partly in an effort to make policies more inclusive, especially in neo-corporatist countries. 
A significant body of literature has explored how the increasing space for participatory democracy influences citizens, politicians  and civil servants (Vetter, 2009; Michels & De Graaf 2010). Yet, we know very little about the impact of said citizen participation on civil society and its organisations (for a few notable exceptions, see for instance: Bherer et al., 2016). In this article, we address this gap by exploring how the increasing space for individual citizen participation affects how local civil society organisations perceive the legitimacy of participatory democracy. 
The context of our study is Belgium (Flanders), a country with a neo-corporatist tradition in which many civil society organisations have a long standing relationship with (local) governments (e.g., through strong advisory and collaborative relationships). With our research we aim for a better understanding of how traditional preferential partners of government (civil society) perceive the shift towards a participatory democracy in which individual citizens are increasingly solicited by government to participate in local decisions. 
Our research focusses on following two research questions: “What are civil society organisations’ perceptions of legitimacy of participatory democracy?” And “To what extent are civil society organisations’ perceptions of the legitimacy of participatory democracy dependent on the conditions under which participation takes place?” 
We formulate the following hypotheses: on the one hand, civil society organisations may perceive increased citizen participation as not legitimate because they fear losing their own preferential relation with government. On the other hand, civil society organisations may perceive increased citizen participation as legitimate because it creates social capital, which turn may strengthen civil society.
To test these two competing hypotheses, we conduct a survey-experiment with a mixed-factorial design. We have two types of respondents: civil society organisations that answer on behalf of their organisation, and individual citizens that serve in the governance of civil society organisations. The survey-experiment contains vignettes with different decision-making scenarios that are randomly assigned over the respondents. This design allows us to compare the results of the dependent variable (input-, throughput-, and output-legitimacy) within the group of different civil society organisations (organisational factors serve as mediating variables). The conditions are included in the independent variable- vignettes differ on the type of initiator of citizen participation (between-manipulation), and on the extent to which citizens are involved (within-manipulation). 
With our research, we directly address the panel’s call for contributions aiming to explore the role of societal actors on the local level, in our case civil society organisations, and the quality of democracy.",Ghent University,Ghent University,Ghent University,Ghent University,,,,,Ghent University,,Liese Berkvens,Bram Verschuere,Arne Roets,Tessa Haesevoets,,,,,Liese Berkvens,,Civil Society,Governance,Local Government,,,,,,Assessing the legitimacy of participatory democracy: the perspective of civil society organisations,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65406&EventID=185
0,"Clean hydrogen is believed to be a cornerstone for decarbonizing hard-to-abate sectors such as aviation and shipping, steel or the chemical industry. In 2020, Germany therefore launched its National Hydrogen Strategy (NHS), in line with similar European-level efforts. To satisfy the expected demand for clean hydrogen, Germany is eying select countries as supplying the country with green hydrogen in the medium and long term. This raises the question of how to judge the sustainability of the emerging energy partnerships with potential producer nations. Much of the available research has focused on estimating their hydrogen production capacity and on comparing the assumed import costs, while some have stressed non-economic factors such as political stability. The present paper presents a more policy-focused approach to assessing the potential for hydrogen partnership. Building on a broad set of criteria, we develop a formal index comprising aspects such as environmental commitment, regulatory environment, and governance. The index on the one hand offers a structured way to compare and contrast producer nations with regard to their policy potential for sustainable hydrogen production, and an alternative approach for assessing possible hydrogen partner countries for Germany and Europe. On the other hand, it adds empirical substance to a growing academic conversation on the external dimension of the EU Green Deal and the foreign policy imperatives of the European Union going low carbon.",Institute for Advanced Sustainability Studies (IASS),"Willy Brandt School of Public Policy, Universität Erfurt",,,,,,,Institute for Advanced Sustainability Studies (IASS),,Almudena Nunez,Andreas C.

Extant explanations of these patterns have all focused primarily on economic factors, framed as current economic hardship, left-behindedness, or long-term decline. We put forward a new explanation: the location of a locality within the nation-state. Specifically, we argue that populist radical right parties are able to capitalize on long-standing grievances and attitudes in peripheral regions, which often predate the emergence of these parties. Analyzing results from national parliamentary and European elections in the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany at the county and municipality levels, we show that a region's location in the nation state influences voting behavior even when controlling for present and past economic circumstances. Ours is the first study on the contextual determinants of populist radical right success that analyses two countries jointly by combining election results from both countries in a single dataset. Certain regions have been peripheral for a long time and have seen strong results for other challenger parties in the past.

0,"In the paper entitled ‘Moral Authority and the Academy under Attack’, Elizabeth Buckner (Buckner, 2022) suggests that a central basis of Turkish academics’ resistance towards increasing neoliberal authoritarianism at their universities was a sense of ‘moral authority’ that is associated with their profession as autonomous scholars and thinkers in the public realm. Such moral authority is a well-rehearsed concept in the sociology of intellectuals. And while it may sometimes represent political narratives of the state, reconceived as ‘social justice’ or ‘speaking truth to power’, it often gravitates towards, or formulates, critical sites of resistance to political power within HE. In the context of Turkey, both conservative populist intellectuals of the ruling Justice and Development party (AKP) (Gürpınar, 2020) and the critical intellectuals of the Academics for Peace movement (Buckner, 2022) have drawn on and performed such ‘moral authority’ in numerous ways with the goal of addressing diverse publics and audiences. As this article will argue, drawing on interviews with Turkish academics living in exile as a consequence of ascending authoritarianist politics, the idea of moralising discourse as a form of authority has a genealogy that needs examination. If ‘good’ according to Nietzsche is that which ‘heightens the feeling of power, will to power and power itself’, then in what ways and to what extent are intellectuals’ moral authority itself another form of power, even where it resists and uncovers the machinations of power. And more importantly, how do we engage with critical intellectualism as  a ‘problem space’ (Scott, 2004, p. 4), that is, as a space of dispute, political contestation and rival views where previous questions, concepts, constructs, ideas, configurations, and so on have irrevocably changed, and where new historical conditions make old questions ‘not so much wrong as irrelevant’. The paper also queries the place of the postcolonial intellectual in this problem space and the figurations it can or might offer to shift registers of resistance in the academy from one of ‘moral authority’ to more humble figurations such as that of the ‘cartographer’ of knowledge, power and resistance (Braidotti, 2021, p. 531).",University of Cambridge,University of Cambridge,,,,,,,University of Cambridge,,Zeina Al Azmeh,Joanne Dillabough,,,,,,,Zeina Al Azmeh,,Conflict,Populism,Knowledge,Critical Theory,Higher Education,Memory,Activism,Political Cultures,"Authorial power, authorianism and the sociology of intellectuals in Turkey",https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65409&EventID=185
0,"The climate crisis is a key challenge for the future of humanity, and it is generally accepted that transport systems need to be redesigned as part of addressing the crisis. Yet little meaningful policy change has been achieved globally beyond rhetorical commitments to ‘de-carbonisation’. One reason may be that policy makers are nervous about the unpopularity of restrictions to car use. Debates about transport policy and practice tend to be framed by the assumption of a conflict between individuals’ autonomy, which mostly favours car use, and environmentally necessary restrictions to car use. Phrases such as ‘giving up your car’ indicate the perceived personal loss restrictions would lead to. Individual autonomy is highly valued and strongly associated with car use. 
This paper seeks to contribute to a reframing of debates about transport by first setting aside environmental considerations for the time being and asking instead which ideas for the (re)design of transport systems a focus on autonomy suggests. The paper also seeks to develop the currently limited research which applies philosophical theories of autonomy to transport (see Lomasky 1997; Stradling, Meadows and Beatty 2000; Nordbakke  and Schwanen  2014; Martens 2017a, 2017b; and  Van Wee 2011).  
Drawing on current conceptions of autonomy – which include Kantian ones (see e.g. Christman and Anderson 2005; Mackenzie and Soljar 2000; Meyers 1989, 2005; Stoljar 2018) – I will address the  question of what kind of principles for the (re)design of transport systems applying the following results in  : 
1.	‘procedural’ individual autonomy 
2.	‘substantive’ individual autonomy 
3.	‘relational’ autonomy
4.	Kantian moral autonomy 
For 4. I will include a consideration of how helpful Kant’s distinction between the empirical self and the noumenal self is in this context. 
The paper will conclude with an outline comparison between the principles for (re)designing transport systems on the basis of autonomy and how transport systems should change to address the climate crisis.",Radboud Universiteit Nijmegen,,,,,,,,Radboud Universiteit Nijmegen,,Bettina Lange,,,,,,,,Bettina Lange,,Political Theory,Freedom,Normative Theory,Policy Change,,,,,Autonomy and Future Transport Systems,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65246&EventID=185
0,"The Enlightenment ideal of maturity is one of the central norms of democratic societies. However, Kant’s moral understanding of autonomy has never been uncontested, as notion of autonomy in modernity (Simmel 2007 [1918]) and later as appropriate normative ideal per se (Allen 2008; Foucault 1982; Mackenzie und Stoljar 2000), nor has it ever overcome its initial state of an unfulfilled regulative ideal (Blühdorn 2021; Haderer 2021). In light of its fragile state, calls to revitalize autonomy have been posed time and again. Against the backdrop of new surveillance and online manipulation of contemporary digitalization, concerns about moral self-determination and the socio-political consequences for democracy of its undermining are at the center of academic debates (Susser et al. 2019; Zuboff 2019; Rössler und Mokrosinska 2013). These debates call upon civil society to reclaim maturity from digitalization’s danger for the 'healing of the autonomous self anew' (Zuboff 2017). Given the ever more fading boundary between the online and the offline worlds (Susser et al. 2019), the issue of new surveillance’s threat to moral autonomy reaches beyond the digital sphere, but concerns every emancipatory project in a digitally mediated society that relies on the values of equality, freedom and justice.
Besides individual and collective struggles against surveillance infrastructure, and despite ever-growing knowledge about the issue of new surveillance and accompanying privacy concerns, the devotion to the use of social networking sites has increased considerably. This low visibility of privacy concerns in behaviour on social media has been framed as 'the privacy paradox in the social web' (Taddicken 2014). There is a variety of plausible explanations for this empirical paradox such as addiction to social media, the relation to self-esteem, convenience, structural constraints for perceived social relevance, cynism or ignorance. These explanations might, however, be only half the story.
Instead, this contribution aims to propose a further perspective that conceives of the privacy paradox in the social web as hint for the need to look towards a critical problematization of our historical moment’s social norms of autonomy in the digital sphere. Put differently, to understand the obstacles of digital maturity in the social web, this contribution puts forth the questions: if the Kantian understanding of autonomy in social networking sites is not considered worth defending, then what notion of autonomy is productively produced in social media profiles? And, how does this notion of autonomy affect public space in a digitally mediated society? These questions require firstly, an extended perspective of autonomy as variable ideal to act (Allen 2008), and secondly, a take on digitalization, not as external hazard to autonomy but as socialization factor in a productive power relationship (Thiel 2018). 
This contribution proposes the conceptual part of an ongoing empirical research project that aims at a critical understanding of autonomy in contemporary digital times. Conceiving of the Kantian ideal as something “never given, it is always a task” (Derrida 2006 [1993]:54), it includes critical perspectives on the autonomous subject but ultimately holds on to the fulfillment of modernity’s moral values (Allen 2016).",Vienna University of Economics and Business – WU Wien,,,,,,,,Vienna University of Economics and Business – WU Wien,,Karoline Kalke,,,,,,,,Karoline Kalke,,Political Sociology,Critical Theory,Social Media,Big Data,,,,,Autonomy within Digital Surveillance and Control,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65517&EventID=185
0,"Growing public backlash against international organizations (IOs) (i.a. Copelovitch & Pevehouse 2019) and attacks of national political elites on the rule of law increasingly challenge governance by IOs. Public opposition to IOs is fueled by populist attacks on the liberal world order (Börzel & Zürn 2021) and the rule of law. When international organizations seek to enforce the rule of law at the national level, they risk provoking hostile reactions of citizens and fueling public opposition to the IOs themselves. The primary research question that this project addresses is: How can international organizations safeguard the rule of law without provoking public backlash? 

We develop theoretical arguments that the acceptance of enforcement actions crucially depends on the relevance of procedural fairness, transparency and ideational consistency between the new norms and existing legal rules, and is moderated by how much people (a) already trust the international organizations and (b) identify exclusively with their own country. The influence of these moderating factors is hypothesized to be activated to a greater extent for citizens of countries that are likely targets of rule of law related enforcement actions. 

These hypotheses are tested using experimental surveys fielded in Poland and the Netherlands. The context of experimental surveys is the enforcement of rule of law by the European Commission and the Court of Justice of the European Union. The findings contribute to our understanding of the conditions that make enforcement actions related to the rule of law legitimate and acceptable in the eyes of European citizens.","Departments of Political Science and Public Administration, Universiteit Leiden",Leiden University,"Departments of Political Science and Public Administration, Universiteit Leiden","Departments of Political Science and Public Administration, Universiteit Leiden",,,,,"Departments of Political Science and Public Administration, Universiteit Leiden",,Honorata Mazepus,Darinka Piqani,Dimiter Toshkov,Nikoleta Yordanova,,,,,Dimiter Toshkov,,European Union,Europeanisation through Law,Experimental Design,Public Opinion,,,,,Avoiding public backlash: Enforcing rule of law in the European Union,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65336&EventID=185
0,"Political parties must be legitimate in order to operate as agents of citizens' interests. Historically, the political legitimacy of mass party organisations was heavily dependent on their large membership base. As is generally known, since the mid-1960s, the organisational model has collapsed, becoming more state-oriented than citizen-oriented (Kirchheimer 1966). (Katz and Mair 1995). In times of political instability, membership and party loyalty have fallen, leading in the rise of alternative forms of partisanship and civil society representation (see Scarrow, Poguntke and Webb 2017, Bolleyer 2020).
This paper looks at partisanship and civil society interests from a different perspective: the financial one. Financial resources have long been considered for their perceptive power and the public dependence of parties, particularly in European democracies. Private contributors, on the other hand, will help us comprehend the legitimacy foundation of the public political actor. Recent changes in the way politics is structured have resulted in digitalization as a kind of modernisation for both old and new political players.
This paper focuses on the adaption process and analyses how political parties in Western countries connect to the web-society and their digital fundraising strategies. Taking into account the major European countries' political parties, the disparities between old (mainstream) organisations and new (more digitalized) players appear to be less striking than imagined. However, the new fundraising tactics pose serious concerns about the legitimacy of political parties and the amount of transparency that they enjoy now.",Sapienza University of Rome,,,,,,,,Sapienza University of Rome,,Chiara Fiorelli,,,,,,,,Chiara Fiorelli,,Civil Society,Comparative Politics,Political Parties,Party Members,Party Systems,,,,Back to the Ground.

0,"Domestic climate change mitigation scholarship focuses largely on explaining policy action/nonaction within and across countries, but less attention is given to explaining adverse counteraction where policy action is taken but later rejected. For example, while pushback, policy repeals, and social mobilizations against climate action have certainly attracted the attention (and consternation) of scholars in recent years, such counteractions tend to be treated as aberrations or unintended consequences. But counteraction should also be studied as a dependent variable, particularly given the growing and often varying experiences of post-adoption climate politics in advanced democracies over the last decade. 

Backlash to coercive or ‘hard’ climate policy (i.e. regulatory and economic policy that imposes mandatory requirements and/or sanctions) is a particular challenge because such policy is likely to be required to meet ambitious global climate targets but may provoke strong resistance. Backlash involves an abrupt and forceful reaction by a significant number of actors within a political community (e.g. mass publics, political elites, organized interests) seeking to reverse introduced climate policy, often through extraordinary means that transgress established political procedures and norms. Such reactions may attack not only policy substance, but also the underlying political authority of those involved in its formulation. Nonetheless, understanding why and how backlash occurs remains challenging. 

Some scholars have recently proposed explanations of backlash to move beyond its common use as a descriptive metaphor. Combining such insights about backlash as either escalating feedback (policy feedback view) or as an eruption of discontent (contentious politics view), this paper argues that backlash needs to be ultimately grounded in a view of contested legitimacy. This is because a coercive or ‘hard’ climate policy mobilizes a new relation of power over policy recipients which must be accepted as legitimate to become normalized and durable. But if this does not happen, then deep discontent is likely to be provoked, and the volatile reactions characteristic of backlash become possible. Such a view locates a common foundation for different emerging explanations of backlash, and for its diverse empirical manifestations (e.g. across both electoral and party politics, and social mobilization and dissent). It also foregrounds the need to empirically understand the processes by which legitimacy is contested within a specific polity. Cases from Australia, France, Canada are used to probe this argument, and to abductively derive propositions for comparative research. Overall, the approach suggests a primarily ideational explanation for backlash, rather than an interest-based or institutional one.",University of Utrecht,,,,,,,,University of Utrecht,,James Patterson,,,,,,,,James Patterson,,Contentious Politics,Environmental Policy,Governance,Public Policy,Political Sociology,Climate Change,,,Backlash to climate policy,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65393&EventID=185

Known as the zaniato principle (lit. taken or occupied), it became widespread during and after the Georgian-Abkhaz war in 1992-1993, which resulted in a mass flight of the Georgian population from Abkhazia and a large-scale redistribution of the abandoned properties among the remaining residents. On a ‘first come, first served’ basis, people entered empty homes and claimed ownership by writing zaniato (often followed by the surname of the occupier) in Russian at the entrance gate or on the walls of a dwelling. Historically, it can be linked to military traditions of looting and trophy taking, now prohibited under international law. 

Although it occurred primarily in the immediate post-war period, , the effects of the practice continue to linger on. Drawing on data collected during long-term ethnographic fieldwork, this paper focuses on a particular legacy: the ruination of Abkhazia’s built environment, which can only partially be explained by wartime destruction. The ubiquity of ruins and abandoned, overgrown spaces has become a defining feature of Abkhazia’s landscape. While many abandoned houses appear ownerless because of their decrepit state, most of them are in fact taken rather than simply a ‘dead matter’ (Stoler 2008). Although the de facto authorities officially nationalised many abandoned buildings after the war, by that time the majority had already been informally claimed. As their ownership remains disputed, numerous buildings – including architectural icons – are left to decay. 

Exploring the informal dynamics behind these buildings, the aim of the paper is to highlight how Abkhazia’s poor socio-economic recovery over the twenty-eight years that have passed since the end of the war in 1993 cannot be explained exclusively by external factors as the lack of international recognition due to its disputed status.  Instead, it is also a result of internal dynamics, including ongoing property disputes. As a civil society activist put it, ‘it is thanks to the “occupied” principle that half of the country is still in ruins.

0,"In the last two decades, China has become less vulnerable to external pressure and has instead launched a counter-discourse against international criticism of its domestic human rights record. A key aspect of China’s foreign policy and diplomacy under president Xi Jinping is to “struggle for global discourse power” in order to “break Western hegemony” around global norms. According to the Chinese Communist Party’s (CCP) historical narrative, China has suffered a century of humiliation and “three afflictions” at the hands of Western powers: “being beaten”, “being starved” and “being scolded”. The first two problems were solved under Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping. In Xi Jinping’s new era of “national rejuvenation”, China will no longer accept being scolded. Instead, the time is ripe to “tell China’s story well” and defend “China’s right to speak”. Projecting an image of confidence in its own system, Beijing no longer presents China’s political and economic model merely as different to liberal democracies in the West, but as superior. The CCP has “opened a new path of human rights protection and added diversity to the concept of human rights”, said a White Paper issued last year.  “China’s socialist democracy is the most comprehensive, genuine and effective democracy”, according to Xi Jinping.  “The standard of democracy and human rights is whether the people of the country are satisfied and happy”, as foreign minister Wang Yi put it in 2021. What is China seeking to achieve with these claims and statements? This paper will analyse how China’s discourse around key UN concepts and terms like human rights, development, rule of law, and democracy has evolved over the last two decades, and assess how effective China’s new narrative is in terms of influencing UN negotiations and debates, and, ultimately, international norms and standards.",The Raoul Wallenberg Institute of Human Rights and Humanitarian Law,,,,,,,,The Raoul Wallenberg Institute of Human Rights and Humanitarian Law,,Malin Oud,,,,,,,,Malin Oud,,China,Democracy,Development,Human Rights,UN,,,,Beijing’s Struggle for Global Discourse Power: Decoding China’s Narrative at the UN,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63361&EventID=185
0,"Why is it important to live under a democratic state? Most people would respond that democracy gives the people the power to rule themselves. Democracy is the ‘power of the people’. It means that individuals are free to determine by themselves under which rules they want to live. This response pictures democracy as an ideal of freedom. However, this view has recently been contested by scholars working on democratic theory (Kolodny 2014a, 2014b, 2019, Viehoff 2014). A prominent figure in this critique is Niko Kolodny (2019), who criticises what he calls the ‘Kantian-Republican’ position, according to which the democratic state is justified because it guarantees that individuals are not under the power of others. Kolodny argues that the Kantian-Republican approach leads to the unwanted conclusion that individuals are being dominated by the democratic state. To avoid this, Kolodny proposes an alternative approach based not on the notion of domination, but on the notion of subordination to social hierarchies.
In this paper, I defend the Kantian approach against Kolodny. I suggest that Kolodny’s approach cannot fully capture the reasons why the state is necessary in order to protect not only equality but also freedom. Disentangling the Kantian from the republican approach, I argue that the former does not suffer from the problems that Kolodny identifies with regard to domination. More specifically, I argue that for the Kantian approach, the state is not merely a means to prevent one’s subjection to others but also necessary in order to render the absence of such subjection possible. Therefore, while the state might still pose a threat of domination, this does not undermine its moral salience. This provides a stronger justification of the state, not only as a contingent means to prevent subordination, but also as a necessary condition to realise freedom and equality.

0,"This paper provides an inside into economic policies put forward in Poland since 2015, when national populist Law and Justice (PiS) party, leading the coalition of United Right scored doubly victory in both parliamentary and presidential elections, repeating its success in 2019 and 2020 respectively. 
The political side of policy-mix installed by PiS government have been the subject of much academic and political deliberation. The reforms to the judiciary, starting with the law on Constitutional Tribunal, have put PiS government in the collision course with the EU institutions on the grounds of the rule of law infringement. The economic reforms however, have received less attention, and at the same time they have proven more difficult for the analysis. 
For one the problem lies in the economic assessment approach itself, which typically is based on macroeconomic performance. To put it differently, the rationality or prudence of economic policies is usually assessed through the prism of macroeconomic indicators, such as fiscal balance or GDP growth. When those indicators look good, then the economic policies in place typically do not raise red flags. 
The second (and related) problem, arises from the conventional understanding of economic populism, which usually is interpreted through the prism of unsustainable short-sighted macroeconomic policies, in short: it is associated with bad economics.
Bearing this in mind, Poland is at best a puzzling case. Between 2015 until the beginning of 2020, i.e. the outburst of coronavirus pandemic, Poland, macroeconomically-speaking, was actually doing fairly well, with strong GDP growth, decent public finances (both fiscal deficit and total public debt to GDP ratio within margins), law unemployment rate, and until the end of 2019 moderate inflation. 
The problem, as this paper argues, lies underneath the macroecoonmic panorama. The true, and most important change that has happened as the product of populist reforms has had to do with incentive structure of the economy which PiS reforms have tampered with, the institutional landscape, and the ownership laws that has been changed in a systematic way since 2015. 
The paper focuses mostly on three types of policies, and their so-far results: large-scale redistribution programmes, with flagship ‘Family 500plus’ programme, the tax reforms, including very controversial ‘Polish Deal’, and renationalization programmes, including the so-called Repolonization initiatives.",Jagiellonian University,,,,,,,,Jagiellonian University,,Joanna Orzechowska-Waclawska,,,,,,,,Joanna Orzechowska-Waclawska,,Europe (Central and Eastern),European Union,Institutions,Political Economy,Populism,,,,Beneath macroeconomic indicators: how populist in Poland have been reshaping Polish economy,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65935&EventID=185
0,"In the absence of international legal state recognition, the ‘statehood’ of de facto states has been prominently conceptualised as based not on absolute physical political power, but on overlapping, networked, improvised, discursive, constructed, and/or performative social processes (e.g. Isachenko 2012; McConnell 2016; Visoka 2018). In a sense, such scholarship argues, de facto states are recognised imaginatively, before they are recognised legally or materialised politically. The statehood of de facto states may be legally non-recognised, but is nonetheless realised through the imagination of local elites and populations. 
In that light, it is rather puzzling that scholars of de facto statehood pay so little heed to Benedict Anderson’s Imagined Communities. While this classic work on nationalism is occasionally referred to in passing, its foregrounding of national imagination(s) in opposition to state sovereignty receives surprisingly little attention in de facto states scholarship. This presentation aims to remedy this caveat.
After highlighting the ‘imaginary’ conceptualisations of de facto statehood prevalent in existing research, this presentation will delve into the potential significance of Anderson’s work for these conceptualisations. First of all, it will argue that both Anderson and de facto state scholarship reject traditional notions of state sovereignty. Instead, secondly, Anderson finds that nations are imagined as sovereign – a contention that will be compared to notions of de facto (state) sovereignty. Third, the imagination of nationhood as ‘limited’ will be analysed in light of de facto states’ tentatively non-cosmopolitan stance against ideas of transnational humanity. Fourthly, Anderson’s critique of Gellner’s ‘invention of nations where they do not exist’ sheds interesting light on popular representations of de facto states as ‘places that do not exist’. Finally, therefore, Anderson’s refusal to outright condemn nationalism per se speaks to ideas of de facto statehood as emancipatory projects.
This paper, thus, brings common theories of de facto statehood in conversation with Anderson’s foundational piece on nationalism, revealing how such a conversation could offer a deeper understanding of the distinctions between imagined political communities and ‘real’ (de facto) statehood – nations without states, and nations with states.",Rijksuniversiteit Groningen,,,,,,,,Rijksuniversiteit Groningen,,Lucas Knotter,,,,,,,,Lucas Knotter,,International Relations,Nationalism,State Power,,,,,,Benedict Anderson and De Facto States: Imagined Communities on the Road to Statehood?,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64654&EventID=185
0,"Do popular party leaders increase the vote share of their political party? The individual-level relationship between the popularity of party leaders and reported vote choice has been well established by existing survey research on parliamentary elections. Yet, whether a greater popularity of party leaders actually translates into a higher vote share for political parties has received no systematic attention. I argue that polarizing party leaders have a greater positive effect on their party's vote share compared to universally popular leaders, because of their greater mobilization potential. This paper examines the relationship between leader popularity and changes in party vote share using cross-national survey data and administrative election statistics. The results enhance our understanding of polarization and the personalization of politics by identifying potential micro ecological fallacies in existing research. They further have important implications for leadership selection within political parties.","Department of Political Science, Trinity College Dublin",,,,,,,,"Department of Political Science, Trinity College Dublin",,Jan Berz,,,,,,,,Jan Berz,,Comparative Politics,Elections,Elites,Electoral Behaviour,,,,,Better to Polarize than be Popular?

0,"The beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic offers a unique experiment for scholarship on substantive representation, political leadership, and gender. Especially, this situation allowed for comparisons of how women and men government leaders acted when confronted with similar political choices on issues that had not yet been the object of party politics. Most notably, scholars have studied possible relations between the gender of government leaders and the success of countries' pandemic strategies (e.g. Bosancianu et al., 2021; Coscieme et al., 2020; Piscopo, 2020; Purkayastha et al., 2020; Windsor et al., 2020). Conducting a first in-depth review of this literature, we find that the conclusions of these studies are surprisingly conflicting. Most notably, the degree to which scholars find women-led governments to be more successful than men-led governments is related to the way success is calculated, of which control variables are chosen, as well as the time span studied. Due to the methodologically sensitive nature of these findings, we suggest that scholars cease approaching the question of differences between men and women government leaders during the beginning of the pandemic as a question of countries’ pandemic performance. Rather, we suggest that this question is approached through studies of whether or not men- and women-led governments applied different policies during the beginning of the pandemic. Thus far, this question has only been studied as a question of the pace of the various lockdown measurements (Aldrich & Lotito, 2020; Garikipati & Kambhampati, 2020) and differences within testing policies (Profeta, 2020; Purkayastha et al., 2020). Thus, the relation between the strength of government responses and the gender of government leaders has not yet been scrutinized. To gain knowledge of this, we conducted a 36 OECD-country study of this. We find that countries led by women did not apply more extensive response strategies. If anything, such countries applied less strict closure and containment measures. Hence, our findings support the idea that the gender of a government leader was not very important for the pandemic performance of the OECD countries during the spring of 2020.",Karlstad University,,,,,,,,Karlstad University,,Mette Marie Staehr Harder,,,,,,,,Mette Marie Staehr Harder,,Comparative Politics,Executives,Gender,Government,Political Leadership,Comparative Perspective,,,"Better, Faster or More Comprehensive?

The main purpose is to explain the perceptions variation related to external threats to national security in the context of the current crisis generated by Russian Federation. The paper seeks to test the explanatory power of several variables such as knowledge about contemporary events, media exposure and threat assessment.

0,"Under the Paris Agreement, 194 governments have submitted Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) detailing their pledged climate change mitigation targets and actions. This centrally orchestrated but nationally driven system underpins the increasingly polycentric nature of global climate governance. Achieving the Paris Agreements’ overarching temperature goal requires both that the NDCs are ambitious enough, and that they are implemented domestically through appropriate laws, policies, and regulations. In this paper, we investigate the drivers of both the NDCs’ ambition and their alignment with those national policies and laws. We argue that ambition and alignment may not only depend on countries’ structural, political, and macroeconomic characteristics such as their income, their governments’ quality, their vulnerability, or their dependence on fossil fuels, but also by their level of involvement in the polycentric climate governance system. We assess this dimension by looking at the level of experience and leadership displayed by government delegates participating in the Paris Agreement negotiation meetings, as these characteristics may enable delegates to influence domestic policymaking in a way that makes it more aligned with international commitments, and by their degree of involvement in other climate-related IGOs and transnational climate governance initiatives, as these connections may provide them with information and tools to design and implement their NDCs. We apply regression analysis to novel data on the characteristics of countries’ negotiation delegations and on the alignment of NDCs and national policies, combined with existing data on level of ambition of NDCs and on transnational networks to test these expectations.",Universität Bern,ZHAW School of Management and Law,,,,,,,ZHAW School of Management and Law,,Marlene Kammerer,Paula Castro,,,,,,,Paula Castro,,Environmental Policy,Governance,Climate Change,,,,,,"Between Global Goals, Domestic Actions, and Polycentric Networks: Explaining the Ambition of International Climate Change Mitigation Commitments and their Alignment with National Policies",https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63429&EventID=185
0,"Migrant populations are highly affected in the event of health emergencies. They are more exposed to experiencing greater vulnerabilities due to a combination of political, sociocultural, economic and legal barriers, that might curb migrants’ access to the healthcare system and welfare services. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the risks these communities are subject to. Even if migrants were exposed to the same health threats as the rest of the population, linguistic and cultural barriers, cost, exclusive health policies, and a lack of legal and regulatory frameworks often compromise their access to the healthcare system and social services. The health crisis is also affecting long-term migrants due to the severe economic collapse and financial crisis.
Since 2020 a range of emergency-driven measures were implemented but they often failed to address the specific needs and vulnerabilities of target populations. Portugal adopted exceptional measures to protect this group, through the implementation of an extraordinary regularisation process to all foreign citizens with pending processes. The adoption of these extraordinary measures sets an example of good practices to safeguard migrants’ human rights and human security in critical times, despite the temporary character of these instruments.
The purpose of this presentation is to offer insights on migrants’ vulnerability in the context of COVID-19, through the case study of Portugal, based on selected indicators of vulnerability (regularisation, access to healthcare and to social security services) which directly concern the impact of the health crisis on migrants.","Instituto Português de Relações Internacionais, IPRI-NOVA",Antonio Nebrija University,,,,,,,"Instituto Português de Relações Internacionais, IPRI-NOVA",,Teresa Rodrigues,Susana Ferreira,,,,,,,Teresa Rodrigues,,Social Welfare,Welfare State,Immigration,,,,,,Between theory and practice.

0,"Certification of voluntary sustainability standards have become a main strategy to enhance human well-being of producers, workers and communities involved in agri-food value chains. Accumulating evidence however points to the limited and sometimes even adverse effects of certification schemes. Partly in response to these mixed results, agri-food companies and producers have developed various alternative and complementary governance approaches to promoting sustainability in value chains. These include inclusive business/direct trade, and solidarity economy.
This growing institutional diversity in approaches to sustainability governance creates an empirical and theoretical challenge of mapping the range of instruments applied in different strategies. Existing typologies in this field classify instruments at a broad level, without disentangling the precise institutional details regarding, e.g., ownership, voice, and the distribution of benefits, risks and costs. The proposed paper addresses this challenge by developing a typology of instruments of private and community-based sustainability governance. It will therefore examine and compare certification, inclusive business, solidarity economy and other strategies with regard to the specific instruments intended to enhance human well-being of producers, workers and rural communities.
Empirically, this study presents the results of an extensive survey of organizations based in Peru and Switzerland that are involved in the production, processing, trading, selling, and certification of coffee and cacao and derived products. Analytically, the study is rooted in the institutional analysis and development (IAD) framework which structures the typology and embeds the discussion of sustainability governance instruments in larger policy analysis.
The expected results demonstrate, first, that value chain actors combine instruments of different strategies into their portfolio which reflects their specific value chain position, organizational mission and motivations regarding sustainability governance. Certification, inclusive business/direct trade, and solidarity economy strategies are therefore neither pure alternatives nor purely complementary. Second, the typology disentangles the precise similarities and differences of these strategies in terms of governance instruments used and underlying theories of change.
In the context of renewed demands to solve persistent sustainability issues in the agri-food sector, the presented typology of instruments associated with strategies including and beyond certification sheds light on important dynamics of partial transformation of private and community-based governance. It may also become a useful tool for further analysis of strategies and instruments of sustainability governance. Finally, it can serve as a foundation for empirical studies tracing the effects of specific instruments and instrument portfolios on various sustainability outcomes.",Universität Bern,Universität Bern,Centre for Development and Environment (CDE),,,,,,Universität Bern,,Samuel Bruelisauer,Christoph Oberlack,Gesabel Villar,,,,,,Samuel Bruelisauer,,Development,Governance,Institutions,Latin America,Policy Analysis,Comparative Perspective,Solidarity,Empirical,Beyond Certification: A Typology of Instruments of Private and Community-Based Sustainability Governance in Agri-Food Value Chains,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65422&EventID=185
0,"The socio-political processes that the European Union and its Member States (MS) have gone through in the last decade - the euro crisis, refugees, Brexit and more recently the coronavirus pandemic and the climate challenge - have fuelled reactions related to the process of integration, giving rise to the (re) emergence of a new transnational cleavage (Hooghe and Marks 2017, 2021). The political controversies related to Europe have allowed political parties to mobilize the European issues from different frameworks, revealing that the orientations towards the European integration process are not linear or homogeneous, but, on the contrary, have different roots and motivations. This research is based on the idea that a more complex political and attitudinal reality is hidden behind the orientations of the parties and that, when we refer to Euroscepticism as a phenomenon structured in a single dimension, there is a loss of relevant information. We propose to build a new typology of orientations and attitudes towards the European integration process that offers a more nuanced perspective and encompasses different ways of orienting the EU beyond the classic distinction of hard and soft Euroscepticism. We investigate the precise nature of variations in orientations towards the EU (principle, polity, policy) in Southern Europe, a region where a decade ago low levels of Euroscepticism at both partisan and public opinion arenas were exhibited.

0,"Previous research has found that citizens’ perceptions of elites’ left-right polarization are one of the causes behind Affective Polarization (AP). But conflict and competition go beyond this axis in many countries in which other dimensions are politically relevant, such as the case of territorial polarization in multinational states. In order to fill this gap, this paper examines the role of perceived polarization along the two main axes of political competition in Spain (the left-right and the territorial dimensions) in the shaping of individuals’ AP. In spite of the alleged ability of the left-right axis to absorb any other political divisions, we find evidence that the perceived territorial conflict also affects AP and that the salience of the territorial conflict shapes this relationship. Furthermore, the impact of perceived elite conflict on each of the axis on AP differs depending on individuals’ self-reported ideology: perceiving polarization on the territorial axis leads to AP only among right-wing individuals, whereas perceiving polarization on the left-right axis leads to AP mainly among left-leaners. We examine the link between elite polarization as perceived by citizens and individual-level AP as well as the moderating role of ideology using an 11-wave Spanish panel survey.

0,"With covid enforcing a retreat to privacy accompanied by appeals to social solidarity based in physical distance, the state appears to be taking back control of public life. Indeed the new regulatory and social practices open a contentious field of claims making which connects the specific physical places of everyday interactions with the political sphere of public governance. But instead of a new state authoritarianism limiting public space, this repoliticization of the city as issue, arena and actor of public politics may contribute to negotiating democratic legitimacies in face of complex uncertainties. For example, in advance of Vienna‘s municipal elections on 11 Oct 2020, the covid crisis has facilitated an unprecedented politicization of otherwise local urban matters in national politics. Questioning how Covid transforms the governance of urban public spaces, this case study uses interpretative policy analysis to trace the electoral contentions of covid to highlight the multifacetted functions of public space for democratic crisis management through diverse discursive interpretations of the ‚right to the city‘. The case of Vienna showed that otherwise local matters of urban planning gained importance for national politics, thus increasing public awareness of the democratic functions of urban space. But as leading political representatives appropriated urban claims for party-political conflicts, such discursive capturing of the right to the city remained rather detached from actual problems of rising social inequalities as well as the diverse spectrum of citizens' creative coping practices evolving on the ground. In order to counter conflictive escalations spreading from party politics toward wider societal distrust, this study aims to highlighting the current political moment as crucial for critical experts to contribute toward democratic deliberation of the rights to the city.",University of Vienna,,,,,,,,University of Vienna,,Monika De Frantz,,,,,,,,Monika De Frantz,,Cleavages,Contentious Politics,Democracy,Local Government,Populism,Political Sociology,Agenda-Setting,Mobilisation,"Beyond Lockdown: how Covid Repoliticizes, and Captures Urban Public Space - the case of Vienna's Elections",https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65165&EventID=185
0,"This paper explores the value-based foreign policy of Lithuania towards Taiwan. Lithuania has come into the spotlight after the opening of the Taiwanese Representation office in Vilnius, resulting in a very intense relationship with People's Republic of China, leading to economic consequences. The decision was based on the so-called ""value-based"" foreign policy approach that The Homeland Union-Lithuanian Christian Democrats (TS-LKD) declared in their election program. Consequently, it was transferred to the Government's program after the victory. However, the question remains open as to why Lithuania has decided to conduct a ""value-based"" policy towards Taiwan. Small states usually choose to focus their foreign policy on their region. Meanwhile, for a long time, Taiwan was beyond Lithuanian geopolitical imagination. Thus, this foreign policy choice is atypical for a small country like Lithuania, despite its strong stance towards its undemocratic neighbours, Russia and Belarus. Besides, the Lithuanian decision to open the Taiwanese representation led to PRC's economic sanctions, which were not considered before the Lithuanian MFA's decision. Therefore, the rationale behind this decision will be the centre of this paper.
The first step of the more extensive research of the decision to open up the Taiwanese Representation office is to figure out how experts perceive Lithuanian ""value-based"" foreign policy. Thus, this paper will initially be focused on the expert discourse regarding the decision while analysing the responses of six experts who will participate in a focus group discussion. The selected experts fall under three categories: university-based, think tank-based, and independent experts. The outcome of this research is combined with the semi-structured interviews of the Lithuanian decision-makers and diplomats. Finally, the expected outcome of the research is to contribute to the small state studies, explaining why and how small states sometimes may take messianic democracy promotion goals and conduct foreign policy outside the traditional geographical scope of small states.",General Jonas Žemaitis Military Academy of Lithuania,,,,,,,,General Jonas Žemaitis Military Academy of Lithuania,,Danguole Bardauskaite,,,,,,,,Danguole Bardauskaite,,China,Elites,Foreign Policy,National Identity,Decision Making,,,,Beyond Small State's Geopolitical Imagination: Value-based Foreign Policy of Lithuania towards Taiwan,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63677&EventID=185
0,"Sweden is one of countries in the world with highest levels of generalized trust and social cohesion. After four decades of generous refugee immigration policy, peaking with the immigration crisis in 2015 with 160 000 asylum seekers, Sweden drastically restricted its immigration laws. Following these events, the political agenda has in a short time changed from being tough on immigration to being tough on immigrants, by emphasizing law and order, the fight against violent crime and what often is labelled parallel societies and neighborhoods at risk. This situation puts issues of generalized trust and social cohesion in a new perspective. 

One of the most recurrent findings in the comparative politics literature on social trust is the negative relationship between ethnic diversity and generalized trust. This paper follows in this tradition and aims to investigate how ethnic background and ethnic diversity in the neighborhood is associated with generalized trust at the individual level. Despite stable trends in generalized trust at the national level in Sweden, it’s important to go beyond the aggregate average and understand how trust varies across local contexts with very different economic and social conditions. 

To reach the aim, we test three hypotheses: 1) that generalized trust is higher among natives than foreign born, 2) that trust levels are lower among individuals living in neighborhoods with more ethnic diversity and higher shares of foreign born, and 3) in line with Putnam’s Constrict theory, that the difference in trust levels between natives and foreign born are equally negatively affected by increases in ethnic diversity at the neighborhood level.

To answer the research question and test the hypotheses, this paper utilizes unique and high–quality cross–sectional survey data annually collected 2016-2021 in Gothenburg, Sweden’s second largest city, by the SOM Institute at University of Gothenburg. The multi-level regression analyzes are based on survey responses from 17 000 individuals age 16-85, nested in 96 larger neighborhood areas where share of foreign born adults varies from 7 to 80 percent. The preliminary findings suggest that foreign born indeed has slightly lower trust than natives, but this difference is much smaller compared to the difference found between individuals living in different neighborhoods. Also, it’s not ethnic diversity per se that is negatively associated with generalized trust, rather the total share of foreign born in the neighborhood. Additionally, native’s and foreign born’s generalized trust are equally negatively affected by an increase in share of foreign born in the neighborhood. The paper concludes with a discussion on how absent integration policies, particularly regarding housing, has led to a very close connection between economic, social, and ethnic segregation with detrimental effects on generalized trust and local social cohesion.",University of Gothenburg,,,,,,,,University of Gothenburg,,Maria Solevid,,,,,,,,Maria Solevid,,Political Psychology,Social Capital,Immigration,Public Opinion,Survey Research,,,,Beyond the Average: Ethnic Diversity and Generalized Trust in a Segregated City,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=62325&EventID=185
0,"Studies on the restructuring of political conflicts in Western democracies postulate that Europeanisation and globalization have led to the emergence of a new cultural cleavage. The resulting polarisation around communitarian and cosmopolitan attitudes creates a significant fault line in contemporary societies, exploited by populist political actors. As a result, national identity dynamics have become re-ignited in the European Union (EU). This paper asks how such communitarian/cosmopolitan cleavage relates to the erosion of the post-WWII democratic consensus within European societies. In particular, we explore how the integration vs demarcation dynamic translates to actual value polarisation and whether it is related to the changing patterns of media use. The paper explores an original dataset on values and social media use in Europe from the ValCon survey (2021). We use self-declared identification as national/European as an indicator of the communitarian/cosmopolitan cleavage and cluster people accordingly. We then test whether these groups are also distinct in a) support of core democratic values and b) patterns of media consumption. We argue that polarisation in the context of cultural cleavage goes beyond a simple divisive line between the support or opposition to democratic values. Rather, we show that different clusters of values (authoritarian, communitarian, illiberal) are supported/opposed in different ways by these groups, and are related to their distinct patterns of media consumption and seclusion in relatively closed information worlds.",Universidad Carlos III de Madrid,Universidad de Granada,Scuola Normale Superiore,,,,,,Universidad de Granada,,Kavyanjali Kaushik,Aleksandra Sojka,Hans-Jörg Trenz,,,,,,Aleksandra Sojka,,Cleavages,Democracy,Identity,Social Media,Survey Research,,,,Beyond the cultural cleavage: Polarisation or differentiation of values?,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65403&EventID=185
0,"In spite of the formal responsibility for European Member states to ensure compliance, the EU´s decentralized policy implementation structure places subnational authorities (SNAs) in a rather important position to achieve compliance. Yet, few studies have gone beyond the national level when analyzing compliance to EU law. Parting from state-centric compliance research, this study investigates instances of subnational noncompliance to EU environmental law, giving agency to subnational levels. In order to explain why some SNAs violate EU law more than others, I argue that compliance to EU law is a multilevel phenomenon wherein SNAs play crucial roles in both the implementation and compliance of EU policy objectives. Building on insights from compliance theory, I test the extent to which politicization, capacity, and power condition the capacity and willingness of SNAs to deal with costs associated with complying to EU law. Instances of noncompliance are measured based on environmental infringements occurring between 2005 and 2020, uncovering notable variation from SNAs across Europe. In turn, opening the door to variation within and across countries helps traverse levels of analysis while adding to current understandings of compliance to European law.",Universitat Pompeu Fabra,,,,,,,,Universitat Pompeu Fabra,,Marie-Thérèse Wilhelm,,,,,,,,Marie-Thérèse Wilhelm,,Comparative Politics,Environmental Policy,European Union,Regionalism,Domestic Politics,,,,Beyond the Member state-Subnational compliance to European environmental law,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63534&EventID=185
0,"On November, 25 2020 activists from the Italian feminist movement Non Una di Meno (NUDM) symbolically submitted receipts (printed on billboards) detailing the costs of the pandemic to the government. The care work performed freely or precariously by women and other essential workers during the first year of the crisis figured prominently among the expenditure items. The present paper explores this engagement with care and social reproduction and does so by grappling with a dilemma that has long haunted social movement studies, related to the relationship between structure and agency. Critical events – and thus, the present conjuncture – represent good empirical tests for any theory addressing this dilemma. Because critical events alone cannot univocally explain outcomes, much of the scholarly debate is focused on factors that mediate and explain movement agency. The role of movement opportunities, organization and grievances, are often explored in this sense. In contrast, this paper uses frame analysis to investigate pandemic discontinuities within the discourses and alliance practices of feminist contentious politics. 
By reflecting on 27 movements’ documents, 46 social media posts (posted between March, 2020 and December, 2020) and four in-depth interviews with movements’ activists, this work explores how the increased salience of care prompted the movement to expand its own frames in intersectional ways, making the struggles of ‘essential workers’ their own. On the one hand, the movement maintained its classic approach and denounced the exploitation of domestic-bound and feminized care work; on the other, it also began to question more radically the private/public boundary implied in this interpretation, showing how the work of social reproduction is performed by essential (and in most cases, underpaid, precarious and racialized) workers as well. These discursive innovations, prompted by the pandemic crisis, make NUDM’s diagnosis of an oppressive link between care and economic, patriarchal, capitalist violence all the more clear. Most importantly, however, this creative force shaped NUDM contentious politics and its alliances in the following two years. The movement’s ties with Yoox, GKN and multi-services sector workers as well as its participation to the central and eastern European collective E.A.S.T (Essential Autonomous Collective Struggles Transnational) all represent instances of intersectional, marginal feminist solidarity. NUDM alliance politics will be qualitatively assessed by retrieving movement documents and social media posts, as well as by analyzing transnational online movement assemblies as well. The expectation is to find a link between the aforementioned expanded movement frame and the direction of movement alliances. In unveiling the reciprocal influences of ideology and alliance practices in social movements and tracking how they have mediated the impact of the pandemic crisis, this paper tries to further complicate a picture which may otherwise appear too deterministic.",Scuola Normale Superiore,,,,,,,,Scuola Normale Superiore,,Greta Rossi,,,,,,,,Greta Rossi,,Contentious Politics,Social Movements,Feminism,Solidarity,,,,,Beyond the unhappy marriage between workers’ and feminist struggles: frames and alliances in pandemic Italy,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65860&EventID=185
0,"Discussions on vulnerability during fieldwork in political science research are frequently limited to arguments on ethics and focus on the static and oftentimes loaded label of “vulnerable populations.” Problematising this focus, the paper makes a twofold argument. First, by surveying existing literature as well as departmental guidelines of the top ten political science departments across the US and Europe, we show that vulnerability frequently remains ontologically restricted to certain pre-defined groups, instead of appreciating the existential nature of vulnerability as universal human condition. Considering vulnerability in this way allows us to focus on the importance of a broader discussion of the concept in the context of fieldwork. Second, building on this critique, we propose a relational view of vulnerability: Instead of focusing on the vulnerability of certain groups or individuals, a relational approach underlines how vulnerability can be exacerbated or alleviated within relationships with others in the field. Drawing on various examples of fieldwork from the literature, we show that understanding vulnerability as a relational concept provides researchers with a powerful analytical lens to identify ethical and methodological challenges arising from their engagement in the field.",European University Institute,Ecole de Hautes Etudes en Sciences Sociales,,,,,,,European University Institute,,Wolfgang Minatti,Frédéric Guillaume Gass Quintero,,,,,,,Wolfgang Minatti,,Methods,Qualitative,Ethics,Theoretical,,,,,Beyond ‘Vulnerable Populations’: Towards Relational Vulnerability in Fieldwork,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65036&EventID=185
0,"This paper focuses on the biggest and arguably, most successful, party within the literature on the populist radical right—the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), or Indian People’s Party, in India. Despite its success, however, the BJP has thus far been largely ignored in the party family. Hence, this paper provides an in-depth analysis of the BJP’s guiding ideology—Hindu nationalism—and situates the elements of nativism, populism, and authoritarianism as defining attributes of the populist radical right as a springboard for comparison. It draws attention to “the people” versus “the elite” dichotomy within populism, highlighting that the BJP was elite-driven in its origin and continues to represent elite interests. The inclusion of the BJP as a case study also challenges much of the ‘received wisdom’ of pre-existing literature, in particular the so-called Third Wave of the populist radical right. In recent years, the increasing use of violence sharply contrasts with the BJP becoming a mainstream party in the electoral arena, which has seized upon the opportunity to legislate in line with a Hindu nationalist agenda. The resulting effectiveness of a populist radical right party in government generates lessons for this body of scholarship, not least thinking beyond a “Western” and European focus; whether a post-industrial precondition is necessary; favoring pro-market neoliberal policies; and challenging previous claims of weak party organization as characteristic of the populist radical right.",Tilburg University,University of Georgia School of Public and International Affairs – SPIA,,,,,,,Tilburg University,,Eviane Leidig,Cas Mudde,,,,,,,Eviane Leidig,,India,Populism,Political Ideology,,,,,,Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP): The forgotten populist radical right party,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63714&EventID=185

The decoupling tendency has not been reversed under the Biden administration and China has practically closed its doors to the outside world. Both in the academia and the media there is a lot of talk about a New Cold War – which might turn out to be a lasting condition.

The visit of Vladimir Putin at the opening of the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics and his meeting with Xi Jinping can be read as a very strong sign of Russia and China uniting fronts. With the two of them at one pole and the US at the other, the rest of the world seems to be facing the choice of joining one camp or the other. Yet, the question remains what names these camps will have on their flags – what stories, what narrative context will support their choices. This is why it is well worth looking into the narratives as they appear in the mainstream media in several countries.

My research focus would be the narratives that appeared in the Chinese, Russian, US, German and Hungarian press about Putin’s visit to Beijing and his meeting with Xi Jinping on 4th Feb. 2022. I will look into what specific binaries are constructed around the visit: e.g. a) difference in governmental systems: democracies – autocracies? b) geocultural difference: East – West? c) value-based difference: free world – slave world? The research will be based on close text analysis of articles in at least ten mainstream media outlets with the biggest readership in each country, within the time range of 4th – 6th Feb. (4th Feb. being the day of the meeting). Although they are narratives surrounding a single political event, yet, they should be able to unveil the differences between the two poles in their interpretation of the current polarization. Media narratives of the perceived “other” can be called “master narratives” of a nation, as they serve to unite politicians and the public, ensuring domestic support for decisions in foreign policy. We live in a world of binary narratives – we also need to see what kinds of binaries they are.

As US and German media might offer greater diversity in their “official stories”, it might also be interesting to see what binary narratives are constructed in media at different parts of the political spectrum. The inclusion of Hungarian media will offer an insight into how the media (itself polarized) of a small country on the semi-periphery of the EU reacts to an event that might prove decisive for its future.

0,"If philanthropy means “love of humanity,” the definition of what constitutes humanity is of increasing importance as self-identified philanthropists seek out increasingly precise ways of quantifying human value. Today’s philanthropists call their gifts “investments” in social improvement, and insist on quantifiable proof that their dollars generated sufficient “returns on investment,” culminating in the growth of the Effective Altruism movement, which determines giving priorities based on “impact per dollar,” typically in the form of lives saved or years of life added to the beneficiaries of their recommended charities. This paper explores the extent to which such quantification threatens democracy at the level of the political subject, and the ability to form and maintain the thick bonds necessary for plurality, deliberation, and recognition. The financialization of giving and the treatment of giving as another form of commercial consumption now threatens solidarity even in nominally radical political initiatives, as with the demands for “receipts” and “refunds” from a bail fund that raised an unprecedented amount of money during the 2020 protests against racial injustice. This paper reads Georg Simmel, Maurizio Lazzarato, and Wendy Brown’s perspectives on valuation and neoliberalism, as well as Amia Srinivasan, Iason Gabriel, and Jennifer Rubenstein’s critiques of Effective Altruism. This set of thinkers provides a genealogy of quantifying the value of human life, and links it to the instrumental vocabularies of contemporary philanthropy, positing that contemporary giving conflates love of humanity with maximizing human labor power. These practices are juxtaposed with Aristotle and Arendt’s explorations of plurality, deliberation, and civic friendship as necessary qualities of the political realm. This comparison elucidates the antidemocratic ramifications of philanthropy’s broader paradox, reducing people to their biological and productive utility and replacing collective solidarity with political pessimism and paternalistic benevolence.",Darmouth College,,,,,,,,Darmouth College,,Amy Schiller,,,,,,,,Amy Schiller,,Citizenship,Civil Society,Democracy,Political Theory,Critical Theory,Normative Theory,Political Activism,Capitalism,Biopolitical Philanthropy: The Antidemocratic Tendencies of Benevolent Quantification,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65882&EventID=185
0,"The refugee crisis that broke out during 2021 at the Eastern border of the European Union and achieved its peak in November 2021 was accompanied not only by massive media coverage, but also by a rhetoric “struggle” among the political representatives of the main actors involved: the European Union, the Belarusian executive (esp. Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko), but also the representatives of the executive of Russian Federation and the representatives of Polish government (EU member country most effected in this crisis). 
The paper builds theoretically and methodologically on the existing research of the phenomenon of “blame” in discursive strategies of political actors. This research (e.g. Hansson 2017 and 2018, Hinterleitner 2017 or Hart 2016) has often focused on such phenomena as the strategies of blame assignment and/or blame avoidance in the discourse of governmental and/or oppositional actors within particular state-political system. This paper aims to contribute to this research in the fields of international relations and also security studies (the refugee crisis at Poland-Belarus border was called by many commentators as another manifestation of “modern hybrid war”).     
The paper will explore political discourse of responsible representatives of the EU (European Commission and European Council) and the executives of Belarus, Russian Federation and Poland, concerning the refugee crisis at the border between the EU and Belarus during the period from spring 2021 to the end of 2021. The textual analysis will be built on the basis of discourse-historical approach. The two-step analysis will include: 1) the qualitative content analysis devoted to dominant narratives included in the public speeches (statements, press conferences, medial outputs) of the responsible representatives of the above-mentioned actors; 2) in-depth discourse analysis focused on discursive strategies of the actors, i.e. argumentation schemes; denying; framing/positioning; strategies of social actor and action representation; legitimation and manipulation strategies.
Contextual dimension, which influenced the motivations of the actors involved, will be also taken into the account: i.e. the differing nature of the actors involved (actors representing both democratic and non-democratic governments; state-actors and actors representing the international organization “sui generis” – the European Union); the context of on-going tensions in relations between the West/the EU on one side and Russia and its allies (Belarus) on the other side, the role of hybrid and information campaigns in these relations; the overall sensitivity of the topic of refugee crisis in the EU context.",Masaryk University,,,,,,,,Masaryk University,,Petra Kuchyňková,,,,,,,,Petra Kuchyňková,,Europe (Central and Eastern),European Union,Security,Qualitative,Narratives,Refugee,,,Blame as a phenomenon in discursive strategies: the case of political discourse about the refugee crisis at Poland-Belarus border in 2021,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65416&EventID=185
0,"Throughout the pandemic, President Trump has been the most prominent voice in American political discourse. Since his 2015 presidential campaign, he has used populist messages to frame an antagonism between “us” and “them”, frequently blaming “Others” for a variety of problems. During the pandemic, rather than actively managing the crisis, the Trump administration attributed blame for the state of the country to “Others”. In doing so, Trump re-adjusted his framing of who these “Others” were and how they were to blame throughout the first year of the pandemic, often relying on conspiracy theories and lacking proof of his accusations.
I conducted a case study combining quantitative and qualitative analyses of Trump and White House communication during 2020, which traced the adaptation of Trump’s positions. It showed how populist framing serves as a malleable strategy that communicators can reapply towards a variety of situations to attribute blame to “Others”. Trump re-aligned his framing of the out-group multiple times, blaming out-groups such as Democrats and “the left”, subordinate political entities, public health experts, and news media for failing the country and “the people” during the pandemic. While he adjusted his framing to the rapidly changing situation during the pandemic’s first days, he framed political opponents as the main culprits for the country’s situation. Thereby, Trump rhetorically polarized the country, often relying on conspiracy theories to minimize the crisis’s political costs for himself during an election year.",Ruprecht-Karls-Universität Heidelberg,,,,,,,,Ruprecht-Karls-Universität Heidelberg,,Maren Schaefer,,,,,,,,Maren Schaefer,,Populism,USA,Communication,Narratives,Power,POTUS,,,Blaming the “Others” – Trump’s Populist Framing During the Covid-19 Pandemic,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65695&EventID=185
0,"EU peace missions have in the past mainly focused on promoting formal or institutional settings in their peace-building efforts in fragile contexts. However, peace missions are involved by practice on a day-to-day basis in informal domestic politics and deal to a certain extent with clientele networks. They have to achieve support by local actors, to follow requirements of ‘local ownership’ or to gain security guarantees. In the literature, it is highly contested if and to what extent this strengthens or inhibits the long-term success of state building and democracy promotion as a peace-building exercise. Thus, the paper explores the following research question: How do EU peace missions collaborate with informal power networks and how do these practices influence the legitimacy of state building efforts? We start from the assumption that the level of convergence between normative legitimacy (the formal right to rule) and empirical legitimacy (the shared belief of the population in the right to rule) is highly contested in post-conflict settings. More often than not, these societies are vulnerable to state capture, i.e. the persistence of informal power networks who ‘capture’ emerging state institutions for rent-seeking and / or control of decision-making. External actors are thus adapting their practices of democracy promotion and more often than not establish informal collusion “under the radar”. As a result of these practices, increasing levels of normative legitimacy of state institutions is often contrasted by decreasing levels of empirical legitimacy of state institutions. In our paper we introduce a new dynamic model of “blended” legitimacy by which we can better explain the impact of these practices of informal collusion in state building in captured post-conflict states. 

We will illustrate our conceptual framework by comparing the two cases of Kosovo and Mali, notably the EU missions EULEX in Kosovo and EUCAP in Mali. Both missions had a strong focus on state building through capacity building of law enforcement agencies but have been facing strong power networks undermining these efforts. Our comparative case study is based on original data from field research in 2019 and 2021, notably expert interviews and focus group discussions.",University of Leipzig,University of Duisburg-Essen,,,,,,,University of Leipzig,,Solveig Richter,Siddharth Tripathi,,,,,,,Solveig Richter,,Conflict,Democratisation,Ethnic Conflict,Peace,State Power,,,,Blended Legitimacy: Informal Practices of Collusion and State Building by the EU in Post-Conflict States,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65790&EventID=185
0,"Political institutions are populated by living, breathing, desiring, suffering, ageing human beings. And yet these institutions are frequently depicted as if they were designed and indwelled by disembodied minds, detached and distinct from their corporeal existence. Paradoxically, the political bodies in which citizens and their representatives congregate and communicate are depicted as forums in which human bodies are largely irrelevant.  
I argue in this book that theories and models of democracy can be challenged and improved by greater attentiveness to the embodiment of its political agents. Referring to an eclectic set of empirical examples and drawing on various bodies of theoretical literature, particularly the work of Michel Foucault, Maurice Merleau-Ponty and Simone de Beauvoir, the book investigates the bodies of democracy, grappling with their various performances and illustrating their capability to rupture the political realm and any reductive account of their own existence.
By standing attentively or turning away, by moving or staying, by eating or starving, by dancing or wailing, embodied humans can challenge stereotypes, inspire protests, rupture conventions and provoke change.

0,"The extensive digitalisation of both internal public administration processes and their services for users is an uncontested goal of politics and society in most countries. However, besides technical challenges, cultural change and data protection regulations appear to be a problem for the visible success of these digitalisation efforts. 
The paper argues that projects with the goal of digitalising public administration often lead to measures and implementation processes that are characterised either by anticipatory obedience or ""practical illegality"". Expecting that data protection considerations could stand in the way of a technical solution, bureaucratic organisations reject possible solutions in the early stages of a project. Commercial enterprises, on the other hand, tend to act on the premise that the first step should be to develop solutions, which do not explicitly violate data protection rules. Users (citizens/clients) are partly directly affected and acting stakeholders, partly their interests are represented by data protection authorities. These authorities play the role of ""prophets"" who interpret and construe the GDPR. Their judgement on good and appropriate data protection is justified by the belief that they are acting as a trustee for the users as beneficiaries. However, the powerful role of data protection authorities means that the good intention of protecting personal data becomes a compulsory exercise that is perceived as a burden.
Against this background, data protection rules cannot be identified as a driver of innovation and improvement. Rather, the menacing interpretation of regulations has the effect of putting the brakes on projects, where technological implementation and digital transformation are breaking new ground. Hence, digitalisation projects have to deal with data protection issues in a more strategic way.
The case study of the project ""ID Ideal"" in Saxony (Germany) demonstrates the impact of data protection on the development and realisation of applications based on the concept of Self-Sovereign-Identities (SSI). In the area where administration, economy and society overlap, use cases are designed for the real life adoption of SSI-based solutions. Only privacy compliant applications achieve the necessary level of trust, which enables their (voluntary) provision and use. Thus, data protection in the broader sense is addressed under the heading of ""acceptability and usability"".
However, the topic of data protection is always an elephant in the room in the ""ID Ideal"" showcase project. When it comes to project management, data protection issues are in fact sidelined for the time being, even for internal procedures within the public administration. The work on appropriate SSI applications spotlights the issues of acceptance, operational efficiency and user orientation. The expectation is that by demonstrating user acceptance under real-lab conditions, a positive judgement on data protection rules will be made later on. So the project is driven by the spirit of demonstrating which regulatory provisions may have to be adapted - and not so much about which technology is allowed by the regulatory framework.",HTW Dresden University of Applied Sciences,,,,,,,,HTW Dresden University of Applied Sciences,,Stefan Handke,,,,,,,,Stefan Handke,,Public Administration,Lab Experiments,Technology,,,,,,Boosted or busted? – The impact of data protection on the digitalisation of public administration,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63808&EventID=185
0,"This paper studies the relationship between the assembly of 150 citizens chosen by lot and other protagonists of civil society and public authorities during the Citizens' Climate Convention held in France from October 2019 to June 2020. The Convention gave rise to interactions that went far beyond discussions between randomly selected citizens involving climate experts, economic experts, legal experts, members of the governance committee, researchers, activists, journalists, elected officials and interested citizens. By inviting those selected by lot to intervene outside the discussion sessions, in the media, at private meetings or public events, the governance committee has kept the model of closed deliberation away. However, the imperatives of good deliberation required control over the intervention of external actors. This tension led to a continuous shift of the boundaries between what can be considered inside and outside the Convention. This contribution aims to highlight the construction and displacement of these boundaries, particularly focusing on the transgression attempts by selected citizens and by external actors seeking to gain access to the deliberative process. Therefore, it contributes to the literature on deliberative systems, by showing that the different arenas cannot be analysed as independent spaces. The paper is based on an ethnographic study carried out by three researchers who observed the entire process, as well as spaces of discussion outside the Convention. We also conducted fifteen interviews with citizens, four with members of the governance committee, three with experts in support of citizens and ten with actors who had taken part in the experience from the outside, in order to capture their profiles, evolution and motivations, and to collect information on the interactions that we were not observable.",Sciences Po Paris,Université de Paris I – Panthéon-Sorbonne,Université Paris 8 Vincennes-Saint-Denis,,,,,,Sciences Po Paris,,Maxime Gaborit,Laurent Jeanpierre,Romane Rozencwajg,,,,,,Maxime Gaborit,,Democracy,Governance,Green Politics,Political Participation,Climate Change,Political Activism,Political Engagement,,Boundaries of a climate assembly: regulations and transgressions: The case of the French Citizens' Climate Convention,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64012&EventID=185
0,"Whereas most democratic theory on participation reveals an uneasy attitude to passion and conflicts, practices of participatory democracy are often initiated and intensified by conflict and opposition. Moments of open conflict emphasize and explicate stakes, stirring up the emotions and passions necessary to fuel political engagement and stimulate collective action. But what to do with the interests of those non-human actors/actants who are not themselves activated by emotions? In environmental conflicts, participation by non-human actors affected or involved in the process sits uneasily with classical procedures of representative participation. 

In this paper, we argue that the representation of non-human actors is often conceived in de-sensitized, emotionless, scientific, juridical forms, as an ‘external factor’ imposing its rules as boundaries on the participatory process. When looking at concrete conflicts in participatory processes however, we can observe other ways of non-human representation which are more embodied, affective, lived and which open up perspectives towards democracy as co-creative processes in which non-human actors are actively involved with and through the bodies of human participants in the production of our lifeworld.

0,"As a young democracy, the twentieth century in Brazil was marked by alternance between democratic and authoritarian periods. During the First Republic (1889-1930) the states of São Paulo and Minas Gerais led the first Republican and Federal experience. The Revolution of 1930 put Getúlio Vargas in the presidency and the new government increasingly constrained the regional elites; particularly, in the civil dictatorship “Estado Novo” (1937-1945) when the federal power was strongly centralized and weakened regional groups.  After 15 years of Vargas era, with the democratization in 1945 regular elections returned, and the Constitution of 1946 established a more balanced Federalism. The brief moment of 1945-1964 is known as the first democratic period that ended with a coup d’état in 1964 that culminated with the military dictatorship (1964-1988).
The research about the democracy from 1945 to date has tended to focus on the National Congress rather than the state’s Assemblies. The subnational legislative perspective is still largely unknown, which is relevant because state-based politics influence Brazilian national politics. What is the state parliament role in the career pattern? Is the state Assembly its own arena or stepping-stone to other positions? The democracy of 1945-1964 was an interesting legislative experience when the states increased their administrative and legislative autonomy; the Constitution of 1946 did not limit the parliamentary initiative and the executive and legislative competed for the same state competencies. In contrast, in the military regime, the legislative Assemblies had restricted legislative competencies, and some of these limitations are still present in the democratic Constitution of 1988.
Due to the fact of wider legislative autonomy,  this proposal investigates seven state Assemblies (Rio Grande do Sul, Santa Catarina, São Paulo, Minas Gerais, Bahia, Ceará e Goiás). The objective is to analyse the trajectory of 1.118 state legislators from 4 legislatures (1947-1963) from the first to the last office held, considering elective and non-elective positions at local, regional, and federal levels. The approach to empirical research adopted consists in seeking career patterns of assembly members. Furthermore, the number of state legislative mandates per politician was considered and the percentage of newly elected members as well. 
The findings of this study suggest that political professionalization from the states had different patterns and the Assemblies were a springboard in the political career for both the state and municipal executive offices and to federal legislative. 
This is the first study to undertake a comparative analysis of state parliamentary career about 1945-1964.

0,"Over the last decades, public opinion on European integration has grown in political importance. To date, studies on Euroscepticism and European integration have predominantly been concerned with explaining whether citizens are generally in favor of or against further European integration. However, European integration has largely shifted away from a simple yes or no question. Rather, it has become a multifaceted process that affects various issues of supranational integration and political cooperation. It is therefore important to understand how citizens evaluate different integration issues, to what extent they support closer cooperation with the EU, and in which policy domains. The bilateral relationship between the EU and Switzerland serves as a unique example to study citizens’ opinions because it is characterized by a variety of policy-specific integration aspects that are time and again contested in the Swiss direct-democratic arena. The analyses will draw on data collected in the framework of the Swiss Election Study (Selects). They first shed light on differences in support levels for various aspects of the Swiss-EU relations. Second, using latent profile analysis, the article identifies groups of citizens that share similarities in their support and opposition patterns regarding these aspects. Finally, it explains the drivers of adherence to these different groups. I argue that not only European integration itself is multidimensional but also explanations of citizens’ support of this process. Because of the risen importance the cultural dimension plays in political conflicts, I expect more opposition to European integration issues that are rather cultural than economic in nature.",Université de Lausanne,,,,,,,,Université de Lausanne,,Lukas Lauener,,,,,,,,Lukas Lauener,,European Politics,European Union,Political Parties,Europeanisation through Law,Euroscepticism,Political Ideology,Public Opinion,,Breaking Down Public Opinion on European Integration: On the Multidimensionality of Swiss-EU Relations,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63800&EventID=185

At the same time, political leadership in member states remains male-dominated which is also reflected in the Council of the European Union. This raises two questions: 1. Which factors influence women’s access to these political leadership positions, how and why? 2. How does the rising number of women in political leadership positions in EU-institutions influence gender equality within these institutions? 
The dissertation therefore aims at identifying best practices in women’s access to political leadership by comparing the central supranational EU-institutions: European Parliament, European Commission and Council of the European Parliament by focusing on women in leadership in the respected institutions.",Hochschule Fulda University of Applied Sciences,,,,,,,,Hochschule Fulda University of Applied Sciences,,Maria Keller,,,,,,,,Maria Keller,,European Politics,European Union,Gender,,,,,,Breaking the glass ceiling?

0,"Recently, social tipping dynamics relevant to sustainability have become the subject of a rich literature. Numerous publications seek to bring the concept of tipping (back) from the natural to the social system and make important contributions to its conceptualization, definition, and constant refinement. Despite its wide array, the current literature has a blind spot: it does not adequately integrate, conceptualize, and measure the role of the political sphere and thus underestimates its importance for social tipping processes. This is the starting point of our contribution, which not only emphasizes the political dimension’s relevance to the analysis of social tipping, but also proposes two main ways to integrate it into such analyses: by conceptualizing the political sphere either as a trigger of social tipping, or as an element that can tip itself. Moreover, to capture the complexity of the political sphere, namely the interaction between networks, actors, and processes, we suggest analysing the political sphere along its three elements: polity, politics, and policy. Finally, we also discuss the main challenges to measuring and empirically testing social tipping in the political sphere.","GESIS, Leibniz",Universität Bern,,,,,,,"GESIS, Leibniz",,Christina Eder,Isabelle Stadelmann-Steffen,,,,,,,Christina Eder,,Environmental Policy,Green Politics,Political Leadership,Quantitative,Empirical,Influence,Policy-Making,,Bringing the political system (back) into social tipping relevant to sustainability,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63993&EventID=185
0,"In the Basque Country, popular movement and local community initiatives have precipitated interesting changes in the relationships and the form in which dialogue is conducted between social movements, public administrations and politicians. Based on two of these initiatives, the objective of this paper is to analyze alternative models of relationship between public administration and social movement networks and initiatives. The paper also draws attention to contributions that the university and social sciences can make in terms of both facilitating the internal strengthening of community initiatives and increasing their legitimacy with respect to public administration and other community agents. To this end, we highlight the epistemological importance of studying and increasing the visibility of instances political creativity. These initiatives make important social contributions including the community management of disused spaces; free training, leisure and culture activities; places for rehearsal and experimentation; barter, recycling and responsible consumption and material and emotional support for excluded people. However, they also facilitate the democratization of political institutions, expanding the horizon of what is understood as possible and achievable. After contextualizing and briefly presenting the two case studies, we conclude that a careful dialogue between popular initiatives and public administrations facilitates a strengthening of those spaces and of grassroots participatory networks of political participation. These networks contribute to the coexistence of diverse groups and identities; to social cohesion and community articulation; to social and institutional transformation; and to the de-commodification and de-bureaucratization of spaces for the exercise of civil rights, and for the self-managed satisfaction of social and cultural needs.",University of the Basque Country UPV-EHU,University of the Basque Country,,,,,,,University of the Basque Country UPV-EHU,,Izaro Gorostidi,Andere Ormazabal,,,,,,,Izaro Gorostidi,,Civil Society,Democracy,Governance,Institutions,Local Government,Activism,,,Broaden the political coordinates of what is possible and what is achievable: relationships between popular initiatives and public institutions.,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64079&EventID=185
0,"How is forced migration governance affected at critical junctures of state formation? Do such situations of high uncertainty trigger change or do path dependencies still continue? Drawing on interviews and archival material from Tunisia between 1950 and 2020, this paper compares how the Tunisian state has dealt with the arrival of refugees from neighboring countries during two crucial junctures of state formation: its independence in 1956 and its democratic opening since 2011. During the Algerian War of Independence (1954–1962), nearly 200,000 Algerians fled to Tunisia, where they were welcomed as prima facie refugees in a spirit of brotherhood between two independence-seeking nations. Multiple local, national and international actors provided short-term support to Algerian refugees and later organized their return – making it the UNHCR’s first mission in Africa. Similarly, since the beginning of the Libyan conflict in 2011, an estimated 500,000 Libyan refugees arrived in post-revolutionary, democratizing Tunisia. While they initially received a warm welcome, especially from families in Tunisia’s south, the Tunisian state has been reluctant to provide humanitarian assistance and residence permits to Libyans. Despite significant differences across both cases, important path dependencies stand out, such as the absence of a crisis discourse surrounding large-scale displacement, the prevalence of a no-camp policy or solidarity narratives without legal implications. These insights suggests that to understand forced migration governance at critical junctures of state formation, we need to analyze whether accommodating a refugee group is perceived as instrumental for – or a risk to – the political transformation process.",Danube University Krems,"Departments of Political Science and Public Administration, Universiteit Leiden",,,,,,,Danube University Krems,,Lea Müller-Funk,Katharina Natter,,,,,,,Lea Müller-Funk,,Africa,Governance,Asylum,Policy Change,,,,,Brothers without rights?

0,"Digital Democratic Innovations (DDIs) have largely been seen by the academic community as a possible solution to the crisis of representative democracy. Unlike non-digital Democratic Innovations (DIs), DDIs can transcend the physical borders to citizen participation and help create wider access to information and collaboration. There is also a hope that DDIs (and DIs) could help nurture political trust in governing institutions. Yet the vast majority of research on political trust and democratic innovations focuses only on one side of trust – the trust of citizens vis-à-vis government and its practices. What has largely been ignored, however, is the trust of actual decision makers towards citizen participation and its outcomes. We conceive of trust as  a two-sided relationship that implies reciprocity. Therefore, when it comes to DDIs, citizens’ trust should not be the only one that matters. It is crucial that decision-makers also have trust in democratic innovations and in the common citizens’ abilities to generate valuable political suggestions. If political decision-makers do not trust citizens and processes of DDIs, then they also won’t trust and implement recommendations generated by them. Therefore, we claim that it is necessary to design DDIs in such a way that they generate political trust from both common citizens and decision makers – citizens must trust institutions and processes designed by the ones in power, and public officials must trust the input of citizens’ participatory processes. In this paper, we argue that transparency is a crucial element which ensures that DDIs generate reciprocal political trust. In order to achieve transparency, all processes surrounding DDIs should be clear and understandable, the platform itself should be user-friendly, engaging and accessible, and both citizens and decision-makers should be involved with the procedure of designing and implementing DDIs as much as possible. Trust is built through experiences, and therefore we believe that being exposed to transparent DDI procedures can enhance relationship of trust between decision-makers and citizens.",Rijksuniversiteit Groningen,Rijksuniversiteit Groningen,,,,,,,Rijksuniversiteit Groningen,,Anna Mikhaylovskaya,Elise Roumeas,,,,,,,Anna Mikhaylovskaya,,Democracy,Government,Normative Theory,Policy-Making,,,,,Building Political Trust with Digital Democratic Innovations,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65003&EventID=185

The analysis will be focused on the extra-parliamentary opposition and on the new parliamentary parties which entered the parliament after the three different legislative elections, held in 2021. There is no proper regulation on electoral campaigns in Bulgaria, or on digital parties. The digitalization of party’ s electoral campaigns have been bolstered by the Covid-19 pandemic. New parties and political entrepreneurs, challenging the mainstream parties, have appeared and developed mostly in a digital mode. Few parties, like the “Movement Yes, Bulgaria!  are implementing digital tools for intra party decisions and communication, candidate’ nomination and selection. Some political parties are designated by their opponents as only “Facebook” parties or clubs of friends.  During the different 2021 electoral campaigns, the anti-system populist party “There is such a People” make usage mainly of its own private TV channel 7/8 TV, Facebook and Youtube.  The digitalization of campaigns appears to be if not more advanced, at least more important for the new parties than for the established ones. Partly it is due to the lack of public funding and access to conventional channels of information and communication. Partly it is related to the type, the essence and the characteristics of newly appearing parties.

0,"Environmental agencies in developing countries frequently struggle to implement policy. Yet few researchers seeking to explain environmental outcomes in the developing world have focused on the internal functioning of environmental agencies. 

I address this gap by analyzing the relationship between administrative structure and regulatory effectiveness in Brazil’s Chico Mendes Institute (CMI), a federal agency which oversees one of the world’s largest systems of protected areas. I focus on two questions. First, how might the re-allocation of CMI's personnel improve its performance? Building on findings suggesting the potential for substantial gains from personnel re-allocation, I then ask: what explains the severe misallocation observed?

To answer question (1), I use fixed effects OLS regression to estimate how the effect of protected area management team size on deforestation varies based on key predictors of deforestation pressure. This analysis covers 322 of the agency’s 334 protected areas over the first ten years of CMI's existence (2008-2017). Model results suggest that various re-allocation initiatives may have prevented roughly 2,200 km2 of deforestation—approximately 38 times the area of Manhattan—over the study period. More than 40 interviews with CMI staff who worked in the Amazon region during this period complement the econometric analysis.

To understand what accounts for the severe workforce imbalance observed, I primarily rely on interviews (n=45) and process tracing. In addition to the field staff mentioned above, informants included former agency executives and headquarters-level staff who are familiar with personnel allocation decision-making processes. Results suggest that the imbalance results from multiple causes. I highlight the role of two institutions in preventing the agency from addressing rangers’ preferences for working in biomes facing greater deforestation risk. First, I emphasize resistance by the Ministry of Planning to the installation of incentive-based personnel management systems commonly used to prevent workforce imbalances. Second, I underscore labor laws, which limit the agency’s ability to mandate transfers. 

These findings carry important implications for environmental governance scholarship focused on developing countries, which tends to focus on political obstacles to policy adoption and policy implementation, as well as policy design. They demonstrate that administrative structure can greatly affect the extent to which a public environmental agency is able to meet its objectives. Furthermore, they illustrate how less commonly discussed political institutions—i.e. resistance from agencies responsible for governing a civil service and public service laws—can undermine environmental outcomes.",Stanford University,,,,,,,,Stanford University,,Gus Greenstein,,,,,,,,Gus Greenstein,,Environmental Policy,Governance,Government,Public Administration,Developing World Politics,Policy Implementation,,,Bureaucracy matters: Administrative structure and performance in Brazil’s federal protected areas agency,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63753&EventID=185
0,"An extensive literature has argued that a professional, meritocratic civil service that is shielded from extensive politicisation is conducive to better political and policy outcomes. The measurement of politicisation of the civil service, however, has been mostly approached through cross-national perception-based expert surveys (e.g. on the extent of meritocratic hiring), which allow for scant differentiation within different agencies or sectors of the bureaucracy and also between different levels of it. The latter is relevant inasmuch as it has been suggested that patronage can be used for very different ends, such as controlling policymaking at the higher echelons of the bureaucracy – a strategy typical of more developed civil services – and rewarding supporters or sustaining party machines at the lower end. In this paper, we contribute to overcoming these limitations by studying the politicisation of the Chilean civil service through a newly assembled dataset that is equivalent to an almost-complete personnel registry of its central government bureaucracies. Covering over 300,000 individuals and over 15 million data points across more than 200 agencies, the panel allows us to analyse the turnover dynamics of Chile’s central government over 14 years (2006 – April 2020), including three presidential elections and their aftermath. As a country with a relatively well-developed bureaucracy for Latin American standards (IADB 2013), and yet as one of the newer and less developed countries of the OECD, Chile provides a test study of bureaucratic turnover dynamics and politicization outside the group of rich, highly stable democracies. Preliminary findings suggest that yearly turnover is not dissimilar to that reported for the U.S. federal civil service (around 12%), but turnover varies highly across agencies, thus highlighting the need for more nuanced measures of bureaucratic dynamics. We also find that, after elections, turnover increases not only for top civil servants but across the board, though decreasingly so as one moves down the bureaucratic hierarchy. The structure of turnover also has a clear temporal pattern whereby turnover is highest for top civil servants in the first year after the election, while turnover for middle-ranking officials peaks in the second year. The pattern is consistent with that found in more developed civil services where control of policymaking is the key driver of turnover. However, the finding that turnover percolates down the hierarchy over time suggests a less than fully Weberian civil service. Overall, our results help us to identify both the Chilean state's ""islands of excellence"" and its zones of more extended political patronage. They also lend support to Gingerich’s (2013) call for disaggregated measures of national bureaucracies to avoid the “level of analysis” problem when treating the state as a causal factor in political science.",The London School of Economics & Political Science,,,,,,,,The London School of Economics & Political Science,,Daniel Brieba,,,,,,,,Daniel Brieba,,Government,Latin America,Public Administration,Big Data,,,,,Bureaucratic turnover and politicisation in the Chilean state,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65761&EventID=185
0,"Public administration scholars have for long devoted intellectual efforts to study and understand the uneasy relationship between elected politicians and non-elected civil servants in democratic systems. The viability of liberal democracies is found to be accommodated by a variety of relationships between politicians and bureaucrats that are based on democratic norms and values, reflected by attitudes and role conceptions that are attuned the specific positions politicians and bureaucrats occupy. We will argue in this paper that the election of the authoritarian politicians and populits to positions of executive power within stable and consolidated liberal democracies urges us to revise our understanding of these relationships. More specifically, whereas our understanding has for a major part of the past century been guided by the idea that the uneasy relationship between the two is due to the inherent unresponsiveness of bureaucracy. Instead of thinking that the bureaucracy is there to be under control of elected politicians, we need to see bureaucracy as an institution that is a pillar under the democratic architecture. This brings us to exploring the idea and concept of ‘guardianship’ for the bureaucracy. The concept has often been used by students of civil-military relationships to denote the often self-proclaimed role of the military within weaker democratic regimes. In this paper we are going to delve deeper into this concept and use it as a starting point for theorizing a possibly new role type for bureaucrats in democracies under populist threat.","Departments of Political Science and Public Administration, Universiteit Leiden",University of Pittsburgh,University of Gothenburg,,,,,,"Departments of Political Science and Public Administration, Universiteit Leiden",,Kutsal Yeşilkağit,B.

0,"In the last decades, interest representation has changed in notable ways. Among the crucial developments are an increased professionalism of lobbying and a more prominent role of other actors than traditional interest groups (Ihlen et al. 2021). Recent research has for example documented the prominent role of private corporations across different policy relevant contexts arenas (Aizenberg and Hanegraaff 2019).
This paper focuses on a context that may be relatively resilient towards an increased political role of private corporations: Scandinavia. The Scandinavian countries are characterized very well organized interest group systems. They also have a strong corporatist tradition where representatives of labor and business have been routinely involved in policymaking. Still, there is reason to expect that particularly major private corporations have adapted to the rupture in corporatist institutions and the more dominant role of other political arenas such as the media (Binderkrantz and Christiansen 2015).
In this paper, we ask: To what extent have individual corporations increased their political activity in the last two decades and what factors explain variation in the political activities of corporations? The analysis draws on two surveys among Danish companies. The first one was conducted in 2001 (Christiansen and Nørgaard 2003)and the second will be conducted in the spring of 2022. This allows us to directly compare to what degree corporations are politically active today with the situation two decades ago. The surveys include questions about both contacts to decision makers, media directed activities and the use of public affairs agencies. In the 2022 survey, we will include questions designed to capture the firm level factors that may affect political activities and the factors related to specific issues that may affect the strategic choices of a firm.

0,"The past two decades have seen substantial deterioration of commitment to democracy and rule of law in a number of countries. In response to this trend, the term 'democratic backsliding' has emerged. The term reflects the fact that, in contrast to the Cold War era, today the displacement of democracy is often a gradual process. Thus, it is possible to pinpoint critical junctures where democratic backsliding either advances or stalls. Since domestic and international courts are now an arena for cases involving 'mega-politics', such junctions would often fall into the jurisdiction of those courts. Based on this presumption, my presentation will explore the courts' institutional potential to forestall democratic backsliding at a critical junction. Specifically, my focus will be on issues of election integrity, which determine commitment to political democracy on many of the critical junctions. I will use the European Court of Human Rights (the ECtHR) as an example of an international court and the Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation (the RCC) as a domestic court. I will argue that the courts' efficiency in forestalling democratic backsliding is dependent on the relative strength of political actors at a given junction. A court will be efficient only if these actors are willing to bring a mega-political issue before a court, and subsequently rely on the resulting judgment in their actions. 
To illustrate this thesis, I will discuss the history of the RCC against the backdrop of democratic backsliding in Russia. Initially the court has been actively involved in the mega-political struggle between the President Yeltsin and the parliament. Yet, this struggle has been resolved in an extra-constitutional fashion, bringing about a new institutional configuration. Ultimately, this configuration has significantly limited the appetite for bringing further mega-political issues for judicial resolution. While some of them have made it to the RCC, it was clear that relevant political actors lacked clout to rely on a wide-ranging judgment. Ascending to power, Vladimir Putin made use of the existing institutional imbalances facing little resistance. As a result, a number of critical junctions occurred by effective acquiescence. I argue that in these circumstances the RCC could not serve as an effective bulwark against democratic backsliding. Rather, the only conceivable strategy for its institutional survival was to adapt to the changing environment.
In contrast to the RCC, the ECtHR is insulated from immediate pressures of domestic politics. Yet, at the same time it might not seem the optimal forum for litigating mega-political issues related to electoral politics. Indeed, the early influential jurisprudence of the Court indicated such issues as a purvey of domestic jurisdictions. However, this approach has clearly changed once political actors in a number of countries indicated their willingness to litigate election-related issues. Today the ECtHR has a growing body of jurisprudence that is directly relevant to critical junctions on the road to democratic backsliding. Yet, which turn will be taken depends not on the Court, but rather on the individual circumstances in the country concerned.",University of Helsinki,,,,,,,,University of Helsinki,,Dmitry Kurnosov,,,,,,,,Dmitry Kurnosov,,Contentious Politics,Democratisation,Elections,Elites,Courts,,,,Can Courts Forestall Demoratic Backsliding?,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65923&EventID=185
0,"Election pledges play an important role in models of representative democracy, as they link the policy offers of parties to voter preferences. According to these models, election pledges enable voters to choose the party representing their preferences before the election and then hold it responsible for keeping or breaking their election pledges at the next election (Mansbridge, 2003). Previous studies have shown that heterogeneous vs. homogeneous election pledges have effects on voter turnout and protest voting intentions (Schnepf et al., forthcoming). So far, however, it has not been examined whether the election pledges of a party can actually attract voters to it. One reason for that are difficulties with measuring the effect of election pledges on vote choice since voters know (or think to know) the political stances of parties. Therefore we make use of the German case where there is to date no party with a high potential to enter the federal parliament that is leftist on the classical socioeconomic dimension (i.e., being in favor of the state intervening in the market) and rightist on a societal libertarian vs. authoritarian dimension (i.e., for example being against immigration, a multicultural society, LGBTQ rights) (Hillen & Steiner, 2020). Using an experimental design (N = 600) we present a fake new party with this novel policy position to participants, either via showing election pledges of the party or by informing participants of the new party via a news article. After the treatment we ask participants about their evaluation of the party and if they would vote for it. We expect that participants supporting Die Linke or the AFD will be attracted by the fake party. Moreover, we expect presenting information on the new party in form of a news article to be more convincing than election pledges since many citizens do not trust parties to keep their election pledges. Additionally, we analyze potential moderating effects of evaluations of election pledges in general and media trust.

0,"As countries worldwide adopt renewable energy, governments can either decide to import or localize the production of components for renewable power plants. Local content requirements (LCR) in

conditions or qualitative evaluations based on anecdotal and aggregate, industry-level evidence. 
Taking advantage of a unique quasi-experimental setting in India where auctions with and without LCR were held in parallel from 2013-2017, we provide first counterfactual evidence of the effect of
LCR on auctions’ participants production and innovation. We analyse data from 41 solar PV auctions in which 6 GW of capacity were allocated, generating a demand shock worth 8.65 billions USD in solar PV modules. While a naive ex-post comparison suggests LCR participants filed more solar patents, matched difference-in-difference estimates reveal participating or winning LCR auctions has no effect on firms’ solar patents and sales until three years after the end of LCR. We quantify and show that low competition in and an insufficient demand shock from LCR auctions likely explain why LCR did not induce firms to produce and innovate more.",Technische Universität Berlin,,,,,,,,Technische Universität Berlin,,Fabian Scheifele,,,,,,,,Fabian Scheifele,,India,Policy Analysis,Quantitative,Causality,Climate Change,Empirical,Energy Policy,,Can local content requirements in solar auctions promote domestic innovation and production?

One potential explanation is that losers (i.e. citizens who voted for parties that lost the election) are dissatisfied because they are less likely to obtain their preferred policies. But to what degree is that actually the case? To what degree is policy-making responsive to electoral losers? And can this potential policy incongruence explain the winner-loser gap in satisfaction with democracy? In this paper we evaluate to what degree policy making in Europe is more responsive to preferences of electoral winners as compared to preferences of electoral losers.

The second dataset consists of all of the Twitter communication of the two main contending candidates, Donald Trump and Joe Biden.

0,"The Internet has been heralded as having the potential to ‘revitalize’ political parties by helping them respond to the participation demands of increasingly individualized citizens, who spurn collective identifications in favor of personalized political action (Margetts, 2006; Chadwick & Stromer-Galley, 2016). This argument is often illustrated with the example of Podemos, a ‘digital party’ that experienced rapid membership growth by opening up intra-party decisions virtually to anyone who registered online (Gerbaudo, 2019). Most research to date has focused on the early development of Podemos, leaving largely unexamined the longer-term effects of its loose, internet-based structures. This paper amends this gap by examining a set of organizational reforms Podemos has introduced to address shortcomings of having a primarily online organization. Drawing on an in-depth analysis of internal reviews, reform pamphlets, and conference resolutions, it shows that Podemos has gradually established new boundaries between affiliation categories and increased incentives to motivate participation of the most politically committed local activists. Lowering barriers of entry helped Podemos to quickly build a large membership base and thus create a sense of legitimacy for the fledgling party, but it was less useful for creating the organizational strength political parties need to survive and thrive in the long run.",University of Warwick,,,,,,,,University of Warwick,,Lluis de Nadal,,,,,,,,Lluis de Nadal,,Political Participation,Political Parties,Internet,Party Members,Technology,,,,Can the Internet Revitalize Political Parties?

But do these protests also lead majority members––whose power to maintain current conditions makes them crucial addressees of protests––to evaluate minority members more positively? While some research suggests that they do, other work finds that majority members interpret minority protests as threatening. We argue that the effect of minority protest on majority members’ group attitudes is conditional on their previous sympathy towards minorities, as informed by their partisanship. To test this argument, we leverage the random variation in timing around the BLM protests to estimate their differential effects on majority members’ perceptions of Black minority and white majority members. We find that this event indeed affects favorability ratings differently, depending on a majority member’s partisanship.

0,"The concept of tipping points is rising on scientific and political agendas, describing the point in time in which a transition happens, the process of overcoming lock-in mechanisms and tipping from a previous system state into a qualitatively new state. Tipping points are well known in sustainability science, for example in climate system research, and are presently entering social sciences as well. There is little doubt that tipping points exist in both social and socio-technical systems, because we can observe that systems and societies are fundamentally different today than they were in the past. Such fundamental system shifts can be observed in many systems (e.g., mobility: horses to cars; communication: telegraph to telephone, to mobile telephone and the internet; human right: abolishment of slavery). The ongoing sustainability transitions, such as the energy transition, will mark similar systemic shifts into fundamentally different systems. If the energy transition is to be successful, the energy system must eventually pass a tipping point into a new stable system state, qualitatively different that the existing one.
This raises the question of whether and how social and socio-technical tipping points can be predicted. The dominant view so far is that they can be observed ex post, but not predicted. However, we argue, if tipping points cannot be predicted, they are politically irrelevant, because that makes policy interventions to affect them impossible (or subject to guessing). Because we can observe (ex post) that tipping has happened and the changes in technology and regime that enable them, we have significant knowledge about how tipping works. And because we can also observe the effects of policies that also at the time of implementation (i.e., ex ante) were intended to trigger deep changes, we here suggest that tipping points can be predicted, and that they can be predicted with some precision – but that precision and predictability is higher in smaller, sectoral systems and lower in larger, more society-wide systems. In this paper, we elaborate on the conceptual issues of predicting tipping points and illustrate our arguments with ongoing developments in which we argue that tipping points can be predicted. All three cases are controversial, but illustrative for the conceptual argument: we will describe why there will be no nuclear renaissance; why the demise of the gasoline car is a done deal; and why the transition to renewable electricity can only fail through dedicated policies to transform the system back to fossil fuels.",Institute for Advanced Sustainability Studies (IASS),Institute for Advanced Sustainability Studies (IASS),University of Oxford,,,,,,Institute for Advanced Sustainability Studies (IASS),,Johan Lilliestam,Franziska Mey,Diana Mangalagiu,,,,,,Johan Lilliestam,,Environmental Policy,Green Politics,Methods,Causality,Climate Change,Policy Change,Technology,Energy,Can we know?

0,"The impact of foreign aid on foreign public opinion has been examined in very few studies. Overall, the correlation between foreign aid disbursements and public opinion in recipient countries seems to be weak. However, aid has been found to improve public opinion of the United States under specific circumstances. Tokdemir (2017) finds that this is conditional on the regime type, with positive effects found in recipient states that are democratic, but not in non-democratic states. Goldsmith, Horiuchi, and Wood (2014) find that positive attitudes about the US develop when US aid is, “… targeted, sustained, effective, and visible.” Our findings lead to a more skeptical perspective. The analysis uses newer Pew Research Center data that moves us into the Trump years. A cross-sectional longitudinal analysis indicates that correlations between aid contributions and foreign public opinion disappear when controlling for attitudes about the US president. These results are corroborated in crucial case studies of Kenya and Turkey.

0,"This paper critically addresses the study of citizenship in a postcolonial context like Kenya. It draws on a digital ethnography with a group of young activists in Western Kenya involved in processes of civic education and engagement to explore notions of citizenship that centre its political subjects. 

Postcolonial and postmodernist scholars have questioned the suitability of Western political theorising of citizenship in postcolonial contexts considering the role of the West in suppressing certain social relations and governance structures or amplifying inequalities and divisions (Kabeer, 2002) as well as considering the contingent and relational nature of citizenship across contexts, scales and sites of belonging (Chung, 2017; Isin, 2009). This relational understanding of citizenship takes its conceptualisation beyond the legal framework of rights and into a multi-layered construct (Pailey, 2016).

This paper follows this critical conceptualisation and presents an interdisciplinary approach to studying citizenship. It does so by combining critical citizenship studies, the Capabilities Approach (Robeyns, 2016; Sen, 1999) and intersectional feminist theory.  It is based on an in-depth case study using digital ethnography, which combines online and offline qualitative methods, including semi-structured interviews, an online focus group discussion, online observations in WhatsApp groups and in-person observations in meetings and public participation events. 

Kenya as a postcolonial state has in place a relatively recent new constitution (2010) and associated legal framework of devolved governance. Yet, this legal framework, which favours citizen sovereignty, decentralisation and public participation is intertwined in practice with exclusionary colonial legacies of subject-state relationships. The paper argues that, in this context, certain civil society initiatives and discourses are enabling the activation and performance of citizenship as a way to challenge discriminatory and elitist practices. For example, sharing knowledge on constitutional rights and accountability mechanisms as well as creating safe spaces that can enable a sense of worthiness and purpose can help to ‘activate’ excluded groups in civic or political engagement. Enacting citizen sovereignty in front of elected officials in public spaces of participation is helping ‘perform’ citizenship among oppressed groups, such as youth and women, even when public participation is not effectively implemented due to weak systems or clientelism. These processes can help to challenge both a lack of implementation of democratic principles enshrined in the constitutional legal framework, as well as a lack of interaction between citizens and the state. In doing this, the activation and performance of citizenship can work as conversion factors for excluded groups to move from a colonial subject-state relationship to enacting the citizenship capabilities they value.",The Open University,,,,,,,,The Open University,,Anna Colom,,,,,,,,Anna Colom,,Africa,Citizenship,Political Engagement,Technology,Activism,,,,Capabilities and intersectionality: studying citizenship in Western Kenya,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64102&EventID=185
0,"Industrial decarbonization remains one of the major challenges in climate policy approaches worldwide. For „hard-to abate“-industries such as the cement industry, simply shifting to a renewable electricity supply or to green hydrogen will not do the trick in achieving net-zero emissions. CO2 will still be emitted as it stems from industrial processes and is not all energy related. What is more, industrial processes such as chemical production often require carbon as a resource. So far, this carbon mainly stems from fossil resources.

It is becoming increasingly apparent that industrial decarbonization will call for a range of different strategies that will have to be developed in parallel. One of the available approaches to achieving carbon neutrality in industry is Carbon Capture and Utilization (CCU): CO2 is captured, converted, and then used, for instance, to produce synthetic fuels or as a feedstock for the chemical industry. As a building block in industrial decarbonization strategies, this so-called CCU approach, although technologically available at least in its early stages, does not seem to receive a lot of attention – neither in academia nor in politics.

This paper seeks to learn more about why that is, thus beginning to address an existing research gap on CCU. It focuses on Germany as a single case study to analyze how CCU is perceived in media discourse. Applying framing as a conceptual framework, it studies which actors are involved in media discourse on CCU, what the perceived problems and challenges around CCU are and what types of solutions actors suggest. For the analysis, the paper draws on a unique dataset of print, online and social media for the years 2020, 2021 and 2022. The analysis enables us to understand better the issues of public and political acceptance of CCU technologies.

Preliminary results reveal the many open questions and challenges surrounding CCU technologies, including high costs, high energy demand, questions surrounding the certification of sustainability of different CCU approaches and its actual contribution to reducing emissions and/or contributing to a circular economy approach. Moreover, it shows that only a very limited number of actors from science and industries are part of the media discourse. It is not a broad societal discourse. Based on its media analysis, the paper finally develops an assessment of the feasibility of CCU approaches as an industrial decarbonization strategy.",Institute for Advanced Sustainability Studies (IASS),,,,,,,,Institute for Advanced Sustainability Studies (IASS),,Sonja Thielges,,,,,,,,Sonja Thielges,,Media,Social Media,Climate Change,Communication,Energy Policy,,,,Carbon Capture and Utilization: The hidden industrial decarbonization strategy?,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65435&EventID=185
0,"This communication is about the evolution of the career patterns and the evolution of the staff turnover of the French administrateurs du Sénat (1950-2010). Unfortunately, it does not have any comparative dimension with European staffers. However I would like to share some data on their professionnal careers as an invitation to think of career analysis as a tool to a better understanding of their roles, and of the collective ressources and constraints of the corps. Facing the confidentiality of their practical work and the impossibility to observe some interactions, career pattern analysis seems to be a way to supplement declarative and reputational methods. (I made 80 interviews with French MP's, staffers, assistants, etc.)

Quantitative data obtained from the reconstruction of careers of about 280 individuals who were administrateurs du Sénat between 1950 and 2013 show that overall, there is no ‘revolving door’ process. Even if staff turnover is increasing slowly since the 2000’s, there is no correlation between committees change of political majorities and administrateurs’ turnover, and there is no correlation between staff turnover and the change of committees presidents. 

The evolution of the career patterns, and especially the evolution of the positions held outside the Senate, such as the increasing number of administrateurs being appointed in ministerial cabinets since the 2000's, confirms the corps' reputation of doing a political work (agenda setting, political advice, etc.). I stress out several types of careers based on loyalty (to the Senate's institution), voice, apathy and exit : politicos, policy entrepreneurs, etc.",,,,,,,,,,,SAMI Mahbouli,,,,,,,,SAMI Mahbouli,,Elites,Parliaments,Public Administration,Political Sociology,Quantitative,,,,Career patterns and staff turnover of the French administrateurs du Sénat (1950-2010) :,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65166&EventID=185
0,"Building on the seminal work by Easton (1957), research on the state of legitimacy beliefs in democratic societies has consistently found that support for the more general objects such as regime principles (e.g. democratic norms and values) and even for regime performance (i.e. how democracy works in the country) remains unwavering (van Ham et al. 2017; Norris 2011; Kneip, Merkel, and Weßels 2020). In contrast, the assessment of the everyday reality of democratic systems is more negative, illustrated for example by low levels of trust in democratic institutions such as the parliament, and low satisfaction with the performance of political authorities such as the government.
While most of the research has focused on assessing the state of public support for national level objects, knowledge of what citizens expect from local democracy and how they assess its state in relation to country as a whole remains scarce (see Vetter 2013 for a notable exception). This is despite the fact, that local democracy is of particular relevance for wider public support. So are local and national democracy evaluations correlated (Vetter 2013, 379; 2002, 612) and it is plausible to assume spill-over effects from local evaluations to more general perceptions of the political system, supporting the notion that local experiences can act as a “school of democracy” (van Deth and Tausendpfund 2013). This is true in particular as it is on the local level where the public is most directly confronted with the consequences of political decisions, as has become particularly apparent during the Corona-pandemic.
Therefore, we aim to contribute to our understanding of the structure of public support of local democracy, its causes and consequences. Based on representative survey data collected in (districts of) four German cities (Hamburg-Altona, Marburg, Offenburg & Wuppertal-Heckinghausen) in 2021 we aim to answer the following research questions:
1.	First, what are similarities and differences in citizens perceptions of local and national political objects? In answering this question, we also show how national and local democracy evaluations relate to one another.
2.	Second, what are the antecedents of (in particular local) political support? We consider both individual-level as well as contextual factors. On the individual level, apart from standard predictors such as socio-economic resources or political efficacy, we also account for the influence of individuals’ understanding of democracy and test how individuals’ preferences for different forms of local decision-making influence evaluations of local institutions and actors. In relation to the context, we investigate the relevance of the respective city in which citizens live and how citizens subjectively assess the impact of the Corona pandemic on their satisfaction with local and national political authorities.
3.	Finally, what are the consequences of political support? Here we focus on how these assessments relate to different levels and structures of political participation.
In sum, we aim to provide a better understanding of the state of legitimacy beliefs in local democracy as well as its causes and consequences at a point in time in which democracies have faced severe challenges.",Heinrich-Heine-Universität Düsseldorf,Heinrich-Heine-Universität Düsseldorf,,,,,,,Heinrich-Heine-Universität Düsseldorf,,Tobias Escher,Katharina Huseljic,,,,,,,Tobias Escher,,Democracy,Local Government,Political Participation,Political Sociology,Survey Research,Political Cultures,,,Causes and Consequences of Citizens’ Perceptions of Local Democracy: Findings from a Survey in Different German Cities in 2021,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65276&EventID=185
0,"To meet its long-term climate targets, the European Union (EU) has decided to move away from fossil fuels to ‘Clean energy for all’. The decarbonisation of the energy system requires fundamental changes to the way we produce, transport, store, and consume energy. While there is a wide consensus that the energy systems must be decarbonised, it is less clear how the future design of the energy system will look like: What renewable energy infrastructure do we build and where? What degree of energy independence do we aim for and at which level (continental, national, local)? What visual and landscape impacts are socially acceptable? And who will ultimately own and control the energy assets? These questions often lead to political and scientific debates around the centralisation or decentralisation of the future energy system. However, the degree of (de)centralisation of the energy system is rarely a variable in research on policy visions and measures, and the policy narratives and potential narrative changes for a centralised vs a decentralised energy system have been underinvestigated. In this paper, we conceptually build on ideas from policy narratives and socio-technical transitions, and we perform a process tracing based on policy documents and interviews, to investigate policy narratives and potential narrative changes of centralisation/ decentralisation of the electricity system in the EU and three different Member States. We expect to find different co-existing elements or features of energy system centralisation and decentralisation. The three central research questions are: How have the centralisation and decentralisation narratives in the EU changed? Why have narratives changed, or in order words, what motivates those changes at EU and national level? Are there differences in narratives and narrative changes between the EU and studied MS, and what explains those differences? To answer this research question, we, first, analysed policy strategies and legislations to identify key elements or features of dominant centralisation or decentralisation narratives, and arguments supporting a rather central or decentral energy system design in the EU and three MS (Greece, Poland, and Spain). Furthermore, we conducted interviews with different actors in the policy arena to receive their perspectives and deeper insights on the dominant policy narratives to understand how specific narratives have changed and why specific policy directions have been taken. In this talk, we will provide important insights into current policy directions and discuss potential implications for the overall energy transition in Europe.",Institute for Advanced Sustainability Studies (IASS),Institute for Advanced Sustainability Studies (IASS),,,,,,,Institute for Advanced Sustainability Studies (IASS),,Diana Süsser,Germán Bersalli,,,,,,,Diana Süsser,,Democratisation,European Union,Narratives,Energy Policy,,,,,Centralisation or decentralisation?

0,"The welfare state in Greece has experienced multiple challenges and problems prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, as a result of its chronic structural pathologies and the financial constraints imposed by austerity. The pandemic that followed the ten-year economic crisis led to a new multidimensional crisis, which increased the pressure on the national health system, and precipitated the uptake of targeted measures and policies to uphold employment due to lockdowns. Arguably, these pressures have brought to the fore the need to establish a new welfare state, more flexible, more inclusive, and more efficient, to live up to the increasing societal, health and economic demands. That said health and employment account for those two sectors that were under huge strain throughout this period and constitute significant areas of thorough investigation. The purpose of this paper is to explore the variations in health and employment policies (key pillars of the welfare state) during the COVID-19 pandemic, and assess whether there is a need for further interventions with regards to social security and prosperity of citizens.  Methodologically, mixed methods in the form of secondary quantitative and qualitative data in the fields of health and employment will be employed for the analysis of this research.

0,"The unprecedented success of and backlash against the trans-national LGBTQ+ rights movement has spurred an increasing amount of research on LGBTQ+ issues in political and social science research. This burgeoning literature includes empirical analyses of queer-related political and social phenomena, and using queer theory and methods to critically engage with broader political issues. The study of LGBTQ+ politics and use of queer theory and methods has never been more popular in political science. Yet, despite increased use of queer theory and method and study of LGBTQ+ politics, there is still very little scholarship that considers the political perspectives, experiences, and opinions of LGBTQ+ people. Bergersen, Klar, and Schmitt (2018) reported that less than three percent of all published political science work on LGBTQ+-related issues involved actually interviewing or surveying an openly LGBTQ+ person. The absence of work on LGBTQ+ experiences and perspectives limits our understanding of politics. The dearth of scholarship on LGBTQ+ people also reveals significant methodological problems. The most notable is that large population surveys typically do not count LGBTQ+ people because they do not include measures of gender identity beyond a binary and they do not include measures of sexuality. On the rare surveys that do include measures of sexuality, the measure is poorly constructed, which limits both the quality and the usability of the data. For example, one measure of sexuality asks respondents to identify as either 1. Straight or 2. LGB. This construction undercounts LGB responses because LGBTQ+ people, in focus group settings, have indicated they stop participating in surveys or other research when their identities are trivialized—in this case, queer sexualities are portrayed as only unique in the way they are “not straight”. Measures that increase LGBTQ+ non-response lowers the quality of the collected data. Additionally, this measure construction limits researchers’ ability to assess differences among LGB people because the data cannot be broken down further into different identity groups. A measure that reduces researchers’ ability to make inferences lowers the usability of the data collected. And this is just one example of a problematic measure of sexuality. The point is that problems in counting and coding LGBTQ+ responses in research settings are prevalent within political science. This paper intervenes in survey research and measurement development by employing a mixed-method approach to construct and test better measures of sexuality and gender identity. The goal is to develop measures that lower LGBTQ+ non-response error and give researchers greater flexibility in their research designs. I accomplished this by first interviewing LGBTQ+ people in Britain about sexuality and gender identity survey measures. I then analyzed their feedback and constructed several different variations of sexuality and gender identity survey measures. To test the efficacy of these measures, YouGov UK will field these measures to a UK general population sample in a survey experiment. The results of this experiment will help us infer which measures effectively count and code LGBTQ+ respondents, thereby solving a major methodological problem in survey design and research.",University of Cambridge,,,,,,,,University of Cambridge,,Nate Roundy,,,,,,,,Nate Roundy,,Identity,Methods,Experimental Design,Survey Research,Empirical,LGBTQI,,,Challenging Heteronormativity in Survey Measure Development: Evidence from a mixed-method study on measures of sexuality and gender identity.,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=62528&EventID=185
0,"This paper asks under which conditions elected representatives are more congruent with the policy preferences of affluent citizens. Ample research has shown that the rich are better represented in policymaking than the poor. Yet, we know little of the sources underlying these inequalities in policy representation. This paper points at the role of civil society organizations in empowering the poor. It argues that civil society can act as a mouthpiece for poor societal segments and diminish congruence imbalances between wealthy and poor public segments. To test our hypotheses, we conducted a content analysis of statements made in eight European news outlets on a sample of 13 policy issues and combined this with Eurobarometer polls. Our results indicate that elected representatives are relatively more congruent with poor voters when civil society mobilizes and when representatives hail from leftist parties. Conversely, civil society mobilization weakens congruence between elected officials and the rich, and rightist politicians are relatively more congruent with wealthy societal segments.

0,"In 2010, when Fidesz-KDNP, a right-wing party coalition gained a two-thirds majority in Hungarian Parliament, legislative processes changed significantly. On the one hand, government parties were able to achieve their legislative purposes without the support of opposition MPs. However, parliamentary election of 2010 reshaped also the field of policy agendas, as the relation between executive agenda and legislation became tighter, than ever before. Statements of the Prime Minister emerged as the most important forum to draw the lines of decision-making (for example to put a legislative focus on executive policy priorities), while opposition parties usually tabled their interpellations and questions to give a reaction to the laws, already passed by pro-government MPs. In other words, if Prime Minister Viktor Orbán put an emphasis on a policy issue in his parliamentary statements, the number of laws on that policy field increased rapidly. However, Orbán’s speeches did not serve only to draw the important lines of legislation. In general, the Head of the government usually reported on executive goals and results, as well as on some symbolic policy issues. For example, he always devoted time to the field of social policy in order to underline the importance of financial and social programs to support families and retirees. Parliamentary statements of the Prime Minister, therefore, were used to be a key indicator of Hungarian parliamentary work.  
However, I assume that pandemic re-shaped the executive-legislative relations significantly. As a starting point of the process, Hungarian Parliament passed the Act on the Protection Against the Coronavirus in 2020. The Act represented the official introduction of a special legal order, the state of danger, which allowed the government to use decrees to prescribe extraordinary legal measures in order to alleviate the epidemic crisis faster and more effectively. Therefore, the new status quo pushed laws into the background from the podium and highlighted decrees as a key tool in Hungarian policy-making. How these changes did affect the executive-legislative relations? How did coronavirus reshape Hungarian parliamentary work? What are the important similarities and differences between the previous decade and the first years of pandemic? I assume that former strong connection between the policy content of Prime Minister's parliamentary statements and legislation weakened significantly. Speeches no longer served as predictors of laws but of regulations, while laws remained the most important tools to introduce decisions on issues unrealted to the health crisis.
I investigate all of the parliamentary statements of the Prime Ministers, every adopted law and each of the promulgated decrees from the last two years. I use three datasets (‘Parliamentary Speeches of the Prime Minister’, ‘Laws’ and ‘Decrees’) built by the Hungarian Team of the Comparative Agendas Project (CAP). Based on my preliminary results, pandemic reformed the parliamentary work significantly. Statements became a forum for the Prime Minister to give comprehensive overviews on the latest news about coronavirus, while focus of legislation remained on issues of other policy fields.",Centre for Social Sciences,,,,,,,,Centre for Social Sciences,,Zsanett Pokornyi,,,,,,,,Zsanett Pokornyi,,Parliaments,Policy Analysis,Public Policy,Policy-Making,,,,,Changes and constancy in Hungarian parliamentary work in the first years of pandemic and before: A comparative analysis,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64738&EventID=185
0,"Climate change skepticism and policy support varies between and within countries (Lee et al 2015). Scholars disagree on how to convince skeptics and increase support for policies (Druckman and McGrath 2019). Research shows behavioral messages often have small or negligible effects on climate change action and policy support (Nisa, Schumpe, and Faller 2019; van der Linden and Goldberg 2020). Sometimes the intended effects of messages are limited or even reversed (e.g. Schultz et al. 2016). We present evidence from two concurrent preregistered survey-experiments in Germany and the United States of America focusing on the source of a message promoting a climate change tax. In both countries, we tested the effect of the same message from the government, an environmental NGO, or a deliberative minipublic—randomly selected small groups of citizens that deliberate on a public issue—on citizens’ support and willingness to pay for said tax, as well as belief in the consequences of climate change. Taken together, the findings suggest that deliberative minipublics are more likely to raise or sustain policy support among citizens compared to the government or environmental NGOs. Across our three treatments in two countries (six tests) we found, on average, a significant small to moderate impact of minipublics in five instances, compared to two significant effects across 12 tests of messages from the government or an NGO. The evidence shows a minipublic endorsement of a climate change tax can a) prevent policy backlash; b) convince citizens to pay higher taxes; and c) influence beliefs about climate change consequences. These findings call for further research and experimentation on message sources, and especially minipublics.",Pennsylvania State University,Duke Kunshan University,Leuphana Universität Lüneburg,,,,,,Pennsylvania State University,Leuphana Universität Lüneburg,John Gastil,Kristinn Már,Janosch Pfeffer,,,,,,John Gastil,Janosch Pfeffer,Democracy,Elites,Governance,Public Policy,Climate Change,Communication,Public Opinion,Survey Experiments,Changing Attitudes on Climate Change: Public Deliberation versus Elite Direction,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=62236&EventID=185
0,"Our aim is to explore, analyse, and compare possible changes in political parties rhetorics during the Czech and Slovak Parliamentary plenary debates using data collected from July 2018, i.e., one and a half years before the COVID-19 crisis has broken out, to June 2022, when the crisis, hopefully, will go down after more than two years.

Countries in Central and Eastern Europe, especially Czechia and Slovakia, might represent interesting cases for analysis in this regard. For both countries, the increase of populism and Euroscepticism has been typical in recent years, but, on the other hand, it seems that these two countries can still be seen as the liberal and democratic part of the Visegrad Group, which is sometimes perceived as the ‘toxic brand’.
As scholars argued (e.g., Buštíková and Guasti 2017; Conti 2018; Moffitt 2014; Pirro et al. 2018), populism and Euroscepticism can be triggered and by themselves can also act as triggers for the crisis. At the same time, Special Issue of Politics (Pirro et al. 2018), focusing on several case studies of Western and Southern European countries and their party systems, concluded that populist parties reacted to the multiple crises the EU faced in the last decade differently. The same can be claimed for Eurosceptic parties as well. Various forms of populism and Euroscepticism are also apparent among Central and Eastern European political parties (see, e.g., Bugaric and Kuhelj 2018; Taggart and Pirro 2021) and are, moreover, evident not only geographically but also between several crises. For example, Kneuer points out (2019) that the migration crisis impacted more old populist parties than the debt crisis, while for the new populist parties, the opposite direction of the influence of the particular crisis was true. Such a cleavage might also occur in the case of the COVID-19 crisis. The general assumption was that the health, and related economic, crisis, as previous crises experiences showed, would further strengthen Eurosceptic positions, but some scholars (e.g., Baute and de Ruijter 2021) warn that national context has to be taken (again) into account. Therefore, the national response to the pandemic could have a different impact on the increase of Euroscepticism and populism.

0,"Recent years have seen a growing scholarly interest in how civil society organizations, organized labor and political parties relate to one another in the production of social contention. Much of this research, however, has remained rather limited in scope: either by examining localized processes, considering a short time span or by looking at specific organizations only. This paper aims at broadening the scope by looking at an entire country (Spain), a relatively long time span (2000-2017) and by not limiting a priori, the types of actors considered. The study is furthermore novel in that it suggests an inductive, data-driven approach to identifying periods of relative network stability and moments of significant network change. The study relies on a protest event dataset on Spain, which was compiled through an exhaustive review of the two major national print newspapers (El Mundo and El País) for the period 2000-2017 (n=3919). Based on the information on the reported co-presence of organizations in protest events, we use multidimensional scaling and structural equivalence analyses to explore the patterns of interactions between organizations. The results show an overall network structure with a densely connected core of established organizations—notably labor unions and left-wing parties—and a loosely connected periphery composed mainly of less established civil society organizations. Taking into account changes over time, however, one finds not only considerable shifts between established organizations, but also periods in which previously marginalized groups challenge the established protest order.",Université de Lausanne,Université de Lausanne,,,,,,,Université de Lausanne,,Nicholas Pohl,Olivier Fillieule,,,,,,,Nicholas Pohl,,Civil Society,Mobilisation,Protests,,,,,,"Changing Movement Boundaries: Exploring Patterns of Interaction between Civil Society Organizations, Organized Labor, and Political Parties in the Spanish Protest Arena (2000-2017)",https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65938&EventID=185
0,"In the social movement studies, there has been a resurgent interest in the effects of collective actors, in particular, their impact on public policy. Scholars found that collective actors often function as “agenda setters”, raising awareness to specific political needs. Even though, agenda setting is a core concept within the political science, theoretical insights, for example, from the “multiple streams” framework (Kingdon 2011) have rarely informed social movement research. This paper seeks to fill this gap by analyzing the evolution of a parliamentary debate on a reform that was introduced after the violent protests against the G20 summit 2017 in Hamburg. By means of a frame analysis, the paper identifies core diagnostic, motivational, and prognostic frames that informed the parliamentary debates on a specific police reform in Hamburg. Examining the parliamentary debates on the same reform in 2008, 2011, 2014, 2018, the paper is able to show how the framing of this debate changed over time. The analysis demonstrates how the NoG20 protests made available a new problem framing, enabling the proponents of the police reform to point to a factual need for policy change. With reference to the concept of “policy windows” (Kingdon 2011), it is argued that the NoG20 protests were sought as an opportunity for policy change, by discursively linking the protests to the analyzed reform. However, the paper also shows how the NoG20 protests not only discursively enabled, but also constrained parliamentarians. Frames that dominated early parliamentary debates, which rationalized policy change with reference to “police violence”, disappeared after the NoG20 protests. It is argued that they became unavailable due to a strong victimization frame related to the physical and mental stress that police officers deployed during the NoG20 protests had experienced. In sum, the paper shows how incidents of collective action, such as the NoG20 protests, can function as “focusing” (Kingdon 2011, Birkland 2016) or what social movement scholars have called “transformative” events (Sewell 1996a, 1996b, 2005; McAdam/Sewell 2001). As such, they can become central elements in the process of agenda setting, eventually informing policy change.",Università degli Studi di Trento,,,,,,,,Università degli Studi di Trento,,Dorte Fischer,,,,,,,,Dorte Fischer,,Parliaments,Political Violence,Social Movements,Qualitative,Agenda-Setting,Policy Change,Protests,Influence,Changing the debate?

0,"Facing increasing inflows of Venezuelans, and a growing backlog of asylum requests, in 2021 Brazil introduced made two policy innovations decisions in 2021 that challenge the clear-cut categorizsations of ‘migrant’ and ‘refugee’ that which prevail in Global North countries. These innovations policy decisions are, 1) despite legally distinguishing between migrant and refugee status on paper, these two categories are granted almost the same rights in practice; and. 2) at the border, dDisplaced individuals themselves state their preference as to whether they seek migratory or refugee status at the border. What can we learn from this innovative policy implementationthe Brazilian case? Based on 26 elite interviews with officials from the government and international organizations (e.g. UNHCR) , in this paper we draw both empirical and theoretical lessons from Brazil’s governance of Venezuelan displacement, regarding debates on the migrant versuss. refugee dichotomy, migrant agency, and policy contestation. Our findings show that the state’s non-distinction between migrants and refugees in practice is a pragmatic decision that, in turn, gives power to forcibly displaced persons. This article contributes to ongoing debates in migration studies about the policy implications of the categorical binary ‘migrants vs. refugees’, which often assume that states’ policies and international organizationsIOs make a clear-cut distinctions between ‘forced’ and ‘voluntary’ migrants and offer two different sets of rights to each category, namely, that . It is commonly assumed that, while migratory visas can accelerate their integration process, refugee protection status offers more sustainable protection. The case of Brazil is illustrative of wider dynamics that shed light on the complexity of policy decisions beyond the ‘implementation gap’.",European University Institute,European University Institute,"Universidad del Pacífico, Lima",,,,,,European University Institute,,Leiza Brumat,Victoria (Vicki) Finn,Luisa Feline Freier,,,,,,Leiza Brumat,,Latin America,Migration,Policy Implementation,Refugee,,,,,Changing the Migrant-Refugee Dichotomy: Brazil's approach to the forced migration governance,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65183&EventID=185

Specifically, the paper is be divided in four sections. First, it will examine the crisis of representation’s main sources and how Chile’s presidentialism may (or may not) have been a direct cause of it. Second, it will analyse whether political power has been historically concentrated in the chief executive as many have claimed. Chile’s alleged hyperpresidentialism has been singled out as one the country’s most pressing issues that need restructuring. Third, the paper will discuss the different courses of actions proposed by politicians and scholars about whether keeping or doing away with the country’s current presidential system and the final decision reached by the Constitutional Convention.

0,"Has the government of China created new multilateral institutions—such as the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and the New Development Bank—to undermine liberalism in international order and replace it with its own norms and values? To listen to many Western and some Chinese observers, one would think so. This paper argues that the real picture is more complex. It develops several points. First, liberalism in international order is both shallower and more contested than existing accounts often allow. In that respect, China’s reluctance to embrace a liberal agenda is nothing exceptional. Second, China’s new institutions cannot all be painted with the same brush. While some of China’s new institutions appear to challenge key tenets of liberalism in international order, others may even reinforce it. Third, even institutions that are created by powerful states must provide other states with incentives for membership, resulting in mutually acceptable compromises. Consequently, attempts simply to ‘upload’ Chinese norms are not always successful. Nonetheless, through the processes of layering and differential growth, China’s multilateral institutions may represent a form of change in international order that is both incremental and fundamental.",WZB Berlin Social Science Center,,,,,,,,WZB Berlin Social Science Center,,Matthew Stephen,,,,,,,,Matthew Stephen,,China,International Relations,Liberalism,,,,,,China's new multilateral institutions and liberalism in international order,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64828&EventID=185

In recent years, China has visibly expanded its engagement in and with the UN. While scholarly attention has focused on how rising China engages the UN on human rights and security, academic discussions about China’s role in UN development work remain limited. It is against this backdrop that we focus on China’s expanding engagement across the UN development system. Based on insights from interviews, document analysis as well as quantitative data on funding and personnel, this paper examines how China’s position in development-related intergovernmental negotiations and its relationship with individual UN entities has evolved. As UN organizations and member states react to and position themselves towards China’s changing role, we ask whether and how these dynamics contribute to reshaping the geopolitical, institutional and normative dimensions of UN work.

0,"The designs of digital platforms for public authorities result from particular choices of communication models and the dominant definitions of problems in a democratic order. The deficit of deliberation on public issues and the insufficient citizens' involvement in decision-making are among major concerns in contemporary democracies. Following it, several multi-tools platforms for public consultations have been designed as some remedy in recent years. But, even if the majority of their applications are local, their users and designers meet with challenges of reconciling the goals of large-scale yet reciprocal and reflexive participation that is conclusive and may contribute to political decisions. While platforms' designers address similar problems, they sometimes differ in solution proposals, depending on the know-how, choices in the situation of trade-offs between values, or institutional contexts. 
In our comparative study of five platforms currently being used by public authorities to facilitate the organization of consultations with citizens, we aim to analyse alternative paths to scaling-up civic participation in connection to the standards of deliberation. Accordingly, we pose the following research questions: (1) What approaches and particular tools have the platform's designers adopted to encourage popular participation? (2) How have the platform's designers planned to deal with the mass participation that would respect the standards of inclusive, reflexive, and consequential deliberation process? (3) How do the institutional contexts and designers' motivations contribute to particular technology choices? To answer these questions, we have analysed features and tools of the platforms next to in-depth interviews with eight platforms' designers (from one to four per platform). We have developed a detailed framework for platforms' analysis, and the results have been discussed with designers to ensure their accuracy. 
All platforms are open-source, while institutions or organizations have managed them as commercial or non-commercial projects. Some support linear processes, whereas others do not require organizers to go through predefined stages. Behind the linear organization of the process, there is a salient assumption that a platform provides guidance to institutional users or even controls their actions to avoid omitting critical procedural elements. 
While some platforms aim at enlarging the scale of participation by synchronizing offline and online processes designed as mini-publics, others prime asynchronous, easy to access communication with the use of algorithms to increase the reciprocity and reflexivity of discussions. 
Although all platforms apply solutions to allow for more straightforward conclusions drawing from a large amount of text, these features, mainly using algorithms and machine learning, are under development. Only one platform provides the visualization of proposals and arguments based on the structuration of the participants' input at the cost of some constraints to the flow of communication.
It seems that if the platform is designed to operate on a large scale and for many different actors, it involves fewer process constraints but might require some compromise to deliberation.",University of Warsaw,University of Warsaw,,,,,,,University of Warsaw,,Anna Przybylska,Borys Tencer,,,,,,,Borys Tencer,,Comparative Politics,Cyber Politics,Democracy,Democratisation,Comparative Perspective,Decision Making,,,Choices and compromises in the public consultation platforms’ design.

0,"The third wave of the coronavirus pandemic coincided with the arrival and distribution of the first coronavirus vaccines for the member states of the European Union. However, while mass immunization in the EU progressed relatively rapidly from a global perspective, it lagged significantly behind Israel, the United Kingdom, or the United States, which resulted in considerable dissatisfaction among political actors and members of the general public, in particular in light of the rising number of cases as result of the unfolding third wave. Consequently, criticism of the EU administration and the procurement conditions soon emerged in several countries. In Hungary, the government also actively sought ways to increase the number of available vaccines by procuring two further vaccines (Sinopharm and Sputnik V) not approved by the European Medicines Agency. These vaccines got quickly labelled as ‘Eastern’ vaccines and became the objects of intense political debates. Governmental politicians and the pro-governmental media presented the delays in the EU’s vaccine procurement as yet another proof of the incompetence of the Brussels elite, while emphasized that without these ‘Eastern’ vaccines, the Hungarian vaccination program could not have progressed as quickly as it did. Contrastingly, most oppositional politicians questioned the safety and effectiveness of the ‘Eastern’ vaccines, and some even labelled their distribution as a ‘human experiment’.
Our research follows up these debates in the pro-governmental and the non-governmental media during the third wave of the pandemic between February and May 2021. We analyze the political and media discourses based on two pro-governmental (magyarnemzet.hu, pestisracok.hu) and two non-governmental (telex.hu, hang.hu) major online media sources. Our analysis contributes to the understanding of how specific policy issues can be dramatized and raised to a more general, normative level, in particularly during such emotionally highly intensive time periods as the coronavirus pandemic, as well as the ways specific policy issues can be framed along the ‘East-West’ and the ‘federal Europa – national sovereignty’ divides.",Corvinus University of Budapest,Corvinus University of Budapest,Corvinus University of Budapest,,,,,,Corvinus University of Budapest,,Akos Bocskor,Reka Tamassy,Anna Vancso,,,,,,Akos Bocskor,,Europe (Central and Eastern),European Union,Media,Social Media,Communication,Narratives,,,Choosing between the ‘East’ and the ‘West’: Media discourses about the ‘Eastern’ vaccines and ‘EU incompetence’ during the third wave of the coronavirus pandemic in Hungary,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65735&EventID=185
0,"Epistemic injustice exists when knowledge relevant to collective decisions goes unheard or gets discounted in ways that serve established hierarchy, and therefore inflicts wrongs upon the individuals or groups so disadvantaged. In Miranda Fricker’s (2007) classic statement, there are two kinds. Testimonial epistemic injustice occurs when prejudice leads relatively powerful people to dismiss considerations (such as arguments or testimonies) based on the social characteristics (such as class, race, or gender) of those advancing the considerations. Hermeneutical epistemic injustice is when the “collective interpretive resources” do not exist to make sense of oppression. We present an additional kind which we call chronic epistemic injustice, which can persist when the voiced considerations of the disadvantaged do get heard, and when relevant collective interpretive resources do exist. We define chronic epistemic injustice as a systematic misalignment between an individual or group’s subjective dispositions and what the individual or group expresses as its wants. Here, subjective dispositions cover values and beliefs, which in turn can draw upon collective interpretive resources.  We stress the collective character of interpretive resources, because (in keeping with epistemic arguments about democracy) different individuals may have access to different relevant bits of information, interpretation, and reasoning, which need combining. Wants for their part can be expressed in terms of preferences and can be revealed in behaviour such as voting. This kind of epistemic injustice is chronic because it can be demonstrated empirically to exist to a degree in every case we have examined. We believe it applies to many, most, or perhaps even all political issues most of the time, affecting many and perhaps most of the people engaging those issues. It is injustice because (as we will demonstrate empirically) individuals experience the misalignment to different degrees; and those who experience it most are, we find, likely to be disadvantaged on other dimensions. Finally we will show how chronic epistemic injustice can be overcome in deliberative settings, as well as through more demanding structural changes.

0,"Reaching ambitious GHG emission reduction goals at national and EU levels requires local action. Thus, the importance of cities and towns for climate governance has been recognized by the European Union and its member states. However, the embeddedness of local climate action in EU multilevel governance and the dependency on national energy and climate policy is often neglected. Thus, this paper discusses, first, the changes of local climate governance in the EU multilevel system because different instruments are needed for specific types of cities. Second, the paper provides an overview on the phases of EU-city relations from the emergence of transnational city networks to the establishment of the EU Covenant of Mayors and the development of the European Green Deal. Third, the paper focuses on the dynamics between leading and lagging cities in Europe. On this basis, the paper discusses the current challenges of local climate action in EU multilevel governance, in particular the need to develop appropriate governance capacities, to take the spatial dimension into account, and to upscale local experiments. Urban transformations in Europe require governance capacities for strategic, integrative, adaptive, and innovative actions. Moreover, there is a need to acknowledge the territorial dimensions of local climate action. Furthermore, scaling and scalability plays an essential role for the European Green Deal. Upscaling the experiences of forerunners implies that they can serve as models for other municipalities. Urban transformations towards climate-neutrality depend on the transfer potential of sectoral transitions and the cities’ capabilities to change underlying ideas and policy paradigms and thus develop unique transformation pathways.",Åbo Akademi,,,,,,,,Åbo Akademi,,Kristine Kern,,,,,,,,Kristine Kern,,Environmental Policy,European Union,Local Government,Climate Change,Energy Policy,,,,"Cities in EU multilevel climate policy:  governance capacities, territorial approaches, and upscaling local experiments",https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64639&EventID=185

However, little research has been done at a metropolitan scale, that is, an analysis of citizen participation in multiple municipalities belonging to an urban agglomeration. The main purpose of this article is to know if the realisation of a participatory process in a metropolitan area has some specificities that enable us to differentiate it from a process at a local scale. To answer the question, we will use a case study methodology, analysing the participatory process of the Urban Director Plan of the Metropolitan Area of Barcelona.

However, evidence from twitter shows the Japanese government failed to establish an effective interaction with citizens during first wave of COVID-19. Combining methods such as sentiment analysis and LDA topic modeling, the results suggest that the government was insufficient to explain the policy and respond to public, the monologue of politicians and bureaucrats led to sustained negative emotion on internet. On the other hand, situation awareness with big data from internet show considerable timeliness and predictability during a pandemic. However, administrative responses to the COVID-19 were still mainly affected by elections and center-local political relations in Japan, which make it difficult to innovate the crisis management mechanism with new technologies. Furthermore, Japanese administrative responses to the COVID-19 during the first wave essentially blocked diversified participants and platforms including social media, which result in the inefficiency of the renowned disaster prevention administration system.",Fudan University,Hitotsubashi University,,,,,,,Fudan University,Hitotsubashi University,Xiaodong Zhang,Jiaqi Zheng,,,,,,,Xiaodong Zhang,Jiaqi Zheng,Asia,Social Media,Public Opinion,,,,,,Citizen-state interactions on social media during a pandemic: Lessons from Japan,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=62221&EventID=185
0,"Citizens’ participation has changed significantly over the past decades. The shift from traditional government to governance has resulted in the inclusion of new stakeholders into public decision-making. Initially, they were representatives of business and NGOs, and in recent years also the so-called hard-to-reach groups, including the elderly, people with disabilities, youth, and immigrants.
The experience of many local governments indicates at the same time that the involvement of so called hard-to-reach groups is not an easy and smooth process. Ones of these groups are undoubtedly children and youth. The situation seems to be motivated by two main reasons. On the one hand, the way of thinking about the involvement of youth, including the belief that they rather should be seen but not heard, constitutes a significant barrier. Against this background, a few issues are of importance. First, formalized, based mainly on representative democracy, decision-making assumes that the possibility for legitimate democratic participation should be attributed to people who possess certain features, e.g., age, experience, or specific types of knowledge. In this context, the political agency of children and youth is excluded from the realm of politics as their opinions are not considered politically relevant in adult terms (Bosco 2010; Häkli, Kallio 2018; Tisdall, Davis 2004). Second, what in a way results from the above is that young people are perceived as laypersons, without sufficient social and political background who are enabled to properly voice their own views (McKay 2014; Jankowiak 2017). This positions them as objects rather than subjects of policymaking, which can be exemplified by the fact that the majority of public authorities as well as non-governmental organizations work for children and young people rather than with children and young people. Consequently, inclusive governing is significantly limited. On the other hand, involving youngsters in governance requires a proper design of instruments and methods allowing for their actual incorporation into deciding. Here all the stages from searching for ideas, through implementation and evaluation of undertaken actions should be covered. This, however, creates important challenges for elected politicians, bureaucrats as well as adult citizens that often leads to a situation when participative agenda is built on pseudoforms of involvement, such as manipulation, decoration, or tokenism. In all of them, youngsters have no or very little control over what they do or how they participate (Hart 1992, 1997; see also Arnstein 1969).
The aim of the paper is to identify and analyze the forms of participation designed for children and youth in Poland and Finland.

In September 2020 the first Hungarian Citizens’ Assembly on climate policy was organized by the new Mayor of Budapest (Oross-Mátyás-Gherghina, 2021). The success of the event was not evident, as citizens’ assemblies, citizens’ juries and other participatory democratic mechanisms have not been used in Hungarian governance. The past decade of illiberal politics led to reduced citizen activism and shrinking venues for policy participation (Majtényi et al, 2019; Hajnal and Boda, 2021). Moreover, environmental politics has been dismantled (Hungary is the only EU member state without a Ministry of Environment), public attitudes are materialistic, green values are weak (Mikecz, 2018). However, the Citizens’ Assembly was a success in terms of organization, outputs and the evaluation of the participants. The Assembly upheld radical green policy proposals with overwhelming majority – far beyond the findings of opinion polls. Also, green attitudes of the participants increased significantly (Oross, 2022). The analysis will seek to answer to the question to what extent are climate assembly had an impact on climate debate, policy and action? The impact of the events on climate debate will be analysed in the light of media appearances, the impact on policy will evaluate the recommendations of the assemblies from a comparative perspective while the impact on action will be discussed though survey data collected among participants of the Citizens’ Assembly in order to measure their attitudinal change.

0,"The legitimacy of a deliberative mini-public is not quantitative and aggregative, unlike elections or votes, but qualitative. In accordance with the theories of deliberative democracy, it is the quality of the procedures and the respect of democratic principles that matter. But do mini-public experiments really follow these theoretical imperatives? Are impartiality, fairness and equity really practiced in contemporary deliberative processes? This might be more difficult for citizens’ assemblies since they are the longest and most ambitious type of deliberative mini-publics, spanning over months or even years and invested with official mandates from political decision-making institutions. Furthermore, respecting impartiality could be even harder for climate assemblies, as climate policies are an “open problem” and not a binary or clear cut one.
In order to tackle this important issue, we conduct a qualitative analysis of the French Citizen’s Convention for Climate (CCC), based on a complete ethnographic direct observation of the whole process and dozens of in-depth semi-directive interviews with key actors (citizens, organizers, facilitators, experts, stakeholders). We will try to draw pragmatic and normative lessons from the procedural successes and failures of the CCC. Can we say, as the CCC co-chair did, that “neutrality is impossible”? But then what is a biased deliberation worth? Can it be considered legitimate? 
The objective of this paper is to identify criteria of legitimacy and procedural impartiality for the deliberation with the help of a fine ethnography of the Citizens’ Convention for Climate. We propose a framework for distinguishing legitimate from illegitimate interactions and influences within citizens’ assemblies. On the one hand, three criteria are highlighted and operationalized: pluralism, transparency, and fairness. On the other hand, we construct a typology of five “modes of influences” in a mini-public: procedural, classic, semi-formal, informal, and external.",Institut d'Études Politiques de Lille,Université de Lausanne,,,,,,,Université de Lausanne,,Simon Baeckelandt,Dimitri Courant,,,,,,,Dimitri Courant,,Citizenship,Democracy,Political Participation,Political Sociology,Qualitative,Climate Change,Empirical,Influence,Citizen’s Assemblies and the issue of impartiality.

0,"Urban areas account for 50% of the world’s population and Europe is one of the most urbanized continents in the world (Sawe, 2018). With cities being the epicenter of worldwide globalization processes and international decision-making, they also became home to some of the major contemporary economic and societal issues, among which the environmental crisis. Air pollution, in particular, poses some serious threats to the health of urban citizens, being responsible for more than 400,000 premature deaths in Europe each year (Schaefer, Kieslinger, and Fabian, 2020). Despite this, European countries still perform variously, as well as cities belonging to the same country. These results are affected by different factors, among which natural parameters, such as geographical positioning, but also by the robust or poor mitigation and adaptation strategies implemented.
This paper investigates to what extent proper policymaking can improve the performance of cities and, as a consequence, countries, in terms of AQ. It reflects on whether shared problems in the practice of pollution containment or, on the other hand, replicable successful strategies exist. The research, therefore, aims at understanding the conditions for either one or the other scenario and ultimately identifying practices among the city diplomatic activities to replicate across different environments, which could best support cities in the strive to reduce air pollution. The research question (RQ) around which the paper will build its reasonings and hypotheses is formulated as follows: How can city diplomacy contribute to tackling air pollution across European countries?
By investigating the relations between city diplomacy and air quality, the paper fills two literature gaps. Firstly, by associating city diplomacy and air quality, the research selects a specific environmental issue as potentially representative of other climate concerns, rather than applying city diplomacy to the broad concept of ‘greening’ and environmental protection. Research studies often focus on the general concepts of global warming and greenhouse gases (GHGs), which have indirect links to the sanitary status of individuals, while AQ is directly relatable to the health conditions of humans (Manisalidis et al., 2020) and therefore useful in drafting local policies. Nevertheless, this choice does not prevent the conclusion drafted by the analysis from being applied to other environmentally-specific issues. This is particularly relevant if it is considered that air pollution and climate change are scientifically deemed to be inextricably linked in terms of emission sources, climate characteristics, chemistry, and mitigation measures (Kumar, 2021).
Secondly, by conducting semi-structured interviews with city officials, this research investigates the prerequisites for cities to become diplomatically successful and overcome a specific climate-related issue, rather than on the potential of city diplomacy itself. In particular, this research categorizes cities’ prerequisites under three dimensions or hypotheses, mentioned as potentially impactful in the existing literature but not yet investigated: the connective role of cities between top-down and bottom-up AQ solutions, the network dimension, where bilateral and multilateral relations, allow cities to draft improved AQ mitigation measures, and the financial, where direct investments from multilateral banks and international private funds to cities can improve AQ diplomatic activities.",Vrije Universiteit Brussel,,,,,,,,Vrije Universiteit Brussel,,Gaia Guadagnini,,,,,,,,Gaia Guadagnini,,Environmental Policy,European Union,Local Government,Policy-Making,,,,,City Diplomacy for a renovated Air Quality policymaking across Europe.,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63271&EventID=185

By drawing from a recent (2020) Norwegian policy decision to give priority to LGBTIQ+ refugees in its refugee quota, the paper discusses some of the underlying rationales of such decision in light of recent theories of civic integration. In particular, I aim to show how the LGBTIQ+ prioritization policy can be seen to align with some of the much criticized aspects of civic integration as policies of, not integration, but migration control (on several levels, incl. first entry and family reunification). Furthermore, I discuss the ways in which the differences in the potential factors contributing to the integration success of LGBTIQ+ (contra non-LGBTIQ+) refugees feeds into our understandings of what successful integration of refugees (and other, non-refugee migrants) may require. While the paper develops a largely critical account of the LGBTIQ+ prioritization policy via the underlying rationales of civic integration, it also points towards an alternative basis for such selection that avoids many of the difficulties of the civic integration approach.",UiT – Norges Arktiske Universitet,,,,,,,,UiT – Norges Arktiske Universitet,,Annamari Vitikainen,,,,,,,,Annamari Vitikainen,,Citizenship,Democracy,Asylum,LGBTQI,,,,,Civic Integration and Refugee Selection,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64154&EventID=185
0,"Current arguments and strategies against democratic backsliding within some EU states have up until now focused on negative sanctions (e.g., financial conditionality, or restrictions of membership or political participation) or passive measures (dialogue and monitoring). This article presents and defends an unexplored positive measure that should be included in the set of strategies for EU member states resisting and/or reverting democratic backsliding. The measure consists in inviting individual members of democratically backsliding states to obtain the franchise, as well as other meaningfully related political rights and liberties in EU member countries committed to democracy. We argue that such an invitational measure is, in some respects, better suited to express EU states’ commitment to democracy than existing negative or passive measures, and connect the argument to current debates on the practical value of the right to vote. We consider the legal ramifications this invitational strategy, and contend that, far from undermining Art. 4 TEU principle of sincere cooperation and the definition of Union citizenship in Art. 10 TFEU, a properly circumscribed civic invitation scheme would be a coherent means to further cooperation and defend Union citizenship. Finally, we consider and reject two counter-arguments – the first based on the idea that civic invitation would constitute impermissible interference in the domestic affairs of another state, and the second that civic invitation could exacerbate backsliding by contributing to the exodus of people committed to liberal democracy from backsliding states (an analogue of the “brain drain” argument).","Departments of Political Science and Public Administration, Universiteit Leiden","Departments of Political Science and Public Administration, Universiteit Leiden",,,,,,,"Departments of Political Science and Public Administration, Universiteit Leiden",,Andrei Poama,Tom Theuns,,,,,,,Andrei Poama,,Democracy,European Union,Political Theory,Voting,,,,,Civic Invitation: Democratic Backsliding & Prodemocratic Partisanship in the EU,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64442&EventID=185

To start addressing this discussion, the present paper aims at investigating practices of civic monitoring, conceptualized as a paramount case of hybridization between social movements and civil society forms of action and their pro-democratic consequences. In doing so, it firstly discusses the democratic value of forms of organized distrust in collective action, introducing the concept of societal accountability. Moving from a theoretical discussion of the concept of civic monitoring, the paper offers a reflection on the interaction between movements and civil society actors in practices of control and oversight of powerholders. Given the vast array of actors populating the monitoring field, one should expect to find different strategies when it comes to oversight and control institutional power. In this sense, the expectation is that monitoring activities are characterized by the co-existence of different strategies and repertoires, as maintained by the hybridization thesis. Lastly, it advances a relational approach to investigate the consequences of monitoring practices, combining forms of integration (horizontal vs vertical) and modes of coordination (social movements, coalitions, communities, and organizations). This approach is in line with a relational and non-aggregative understanding of collective action, which dismantles the well-entrenched idea that associates social movements with the use of specific repertoires of action. On the contrary, relational accounts of collective action focus on patterns of interaction to differentiate among forms of civic engagement. Internal differences are thus determined by modes of coordination, namely on relational patterns characterizing the interaction between and within civic actors. Drawing from case studies coming from the Italian and Spanish accountability contexts, the paper maintains that practices of civic monitoring represent a perfect example of hybridization of the civic sphere at the level of practices. The analysis of the empirical material let emerge the co-occurrence of four different types of civic monitoring: 1. Monitoring Campaigns, 2. Communities, 3. Shared Monitoring, 4. Disclosure Monitoring. It also maintains that their consequences are better understood when considering the relational structure and strategies through which these practices unfold.",Scuola Normale Superiore,,,,,,,,Scuola Normale Superiore,,Alessandra Lo Piccolo,,,,,,,,Alessandra Lo Piccolo,,Civil Society,Democracy,Political Participation,Political Sociology,Mobilisation,Activism,,,Civic Monitoring: Hybrid Practices of Democratic Participation in Italy and Spain,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65308&EventID=185
0,"To what extent does participation in the policy process transform civil society and how does civil society respond to, and influence public policies? 
This question has increasingly gained salience in the European Union (EU)’s neighbourhood as a result of both domestic and external pressure, including local demands for accountability and EU shift towards a “partnership with societies”. However, due to the restrictive conceptualisation of CSOs as instruments of EU-level actors in much of the governance-oriented literature, we miss a truly bottom-up perspective that would take into account CSOs as actors in their own right. 
In order to bridge this analytical gap, we build on the governmentality perspective, which focuses on power and micro-practices and enables us to dig deeper by unearthing power relations in governance structures in a Foucauldian “archaeology of power” tradition (Burchell et al. 1991). Drawing on critical scholarship, we conceptualise what participation in the policy process does to civil society actors in the EU’s neighbourhood. We also study how hybrid regimes use civil society as part of their own legitimation strategies and how civil society actors respond to such challenges. Empirically, we offer a comparative analysis based upon empirical data on CSOs participation in four eastern and southern ENP countries, gathered as part of an international research project (INTEND, ANR-FWF).",Freie Universität Berlin,Université Sorbonne Nouvelle,,,,,,,Freie Universität Berlin,,Aron Buzogany,Laure Delcour,,,,,,,Aron Buzogany,,Civil Society,European Union,Interest Groups,Critical Theory,Comparative Perspective,Policy-Making,,,Civil society and participation in the EU’s neighbourhood: Towards a bottom-up approach,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64401&EventID=185

Here, we use a novel machine learning based algorithm to classify salience and political preferences on carbon pricing among German politicians from 1980 to 2020. Our algorithm is trained on a dataset of manually coded parliamentary speeches and uses an ensemble of machine learning classifiers to detect and classify political positions on carbon pricing and other climate change mitigation policies. Here, we present the first results of our classification analysis and compare salience and political preferences for carbon pricing across politicians, political parties, and time.

0,"Policy actors are a central element in policy making and many classic and contemporary policy theories stress and investigate their importance. Policy actors are usually classified onto state / institutional / official actors and nonstate / noninstitutional / unofficial actors, with several subtypes within each. Then the features of actors are analysed, their power, resources, skills, strategies, perspectives, ideas, etc., to get more precise insight into their influence onto policy making. Finally, research is devoted to the relationships among actors and the structure of those relations in the form of triangles, networks, coalitions, or communities. Even though actors are a major issue in policy process research, there is still a lack of knowledge on how policy actors affect policy making. The roles different types of actors, with different features and relationships, take in the agenda-setting, policy design, and implementation are one of the weakest parts of the discipline. Concept of policy entrepreneurs is a good exception (Kingdon, 1984, Petridou, Mintrop, 2020), but what other heterogeneous roles policy actors perform in policy making? There is no systematic classification of all the roles actors can fulfil within policy transformations. 

This is where this paper will try to contribute by conducting an empirical investigation on diverse variants of policy actor’s roles, with descriptive purpose and a descriptive research question. It will be founded on the cross-sectoral comparison of Croatian public policies, that represent diverse policy areas (from defence and foreign affairs, law and order, economic, social, sectoral, and other policies, see Compston, ed, 2004). Data gathering will be done through expert interviews with Croatian scholars from different disciplines, that are devoted to studies of specific sectors. Whole material will be transcribed verbatim and processed by NVivo software. Expert’s answers on types of conduct that actors undertake will be coded inductively, without strict prior theoretical assumptions, to empirically extract broader actor’s behaviour patterns that appear in practice of policy making. The analysis will be based on the research strategy of thematic analysis (Boyatzis, 1998; Fereday and Muir-Cochrane, 2006; Guest al, 2012). This could be a base for a solid classification of policy actor’s roles in policy making, to enhance empirical policy theory on policy actors and their effect on policy transitions and transformations.",University of Zagreb,,,,,,,,University of Zagreb,,Ana Petek,,,,,,,,Ana Petek,,Policy Analysis,Public Policy,Qualitative,Decision Making,Empirical,Policy-Making,,,CLASSIFYING ROLES OF POLICY ACTORS,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64472&EventID=185
0,"Climate assemblies (CAs) are being increasingly used to engage citizens in climate change policy making throughout Europe. Consequently, their design and operation are focused on optimising their influence on politicians, governments, and policymakers. Much less emphasis is placed on how and to what extent CAs influence the wider public. However, public awareness of and support for CAs could stimulate public debate about climate change action and possibly change attitudes too. This could also increase pressure on decision-makers to act on an assembly’s recommendations, improving their influence on climate change policymaking. We assess this through an analysis of two UK cases. The publicity budgets for Climate Assembly UK (CAUK) and Scotland’s Climate Assembly (SCA) were relatively higher than previous mini-publics, with dedicated mainstream and social media campaigns, however, public awareness of both these CAs remained low. Using the results of population surveys this study provides intersectional analysis of public awareness of, and attitudes to, CAs. Using the results of surveys of the participants of each assembly, we compare public views with those of the assembly members to consider how participation in CAs affects attitudes to the process. There have been calls to increase resources for publicising CAs. The results of this study could aid how these resources could be allocated for future CAs to realise the benefits of increased public knowledge and awareness.",Scottish Government,Newcastle University,Newcastle University,,,,,,Newcastle University,,Nadine Andrews,Jayne Carrick,Stephen Elstub,,,,,,Stephen Elstub,,Democracy,Governance,Green Politics,Media,Political Participation,Climate Change,Political Engagement,,Climate Assemblies and Public Debate and Opinion: An Analysis of UK Cases,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64011&EventID=185
0,"Over the last decades, the rise of the far right and populist movements in Europe and its resulting impact on liberal democracies and party politics have been subject to a vivid debate among researchers. In addition, researches, the public and politics intensively discussed the current environmental crisis (air and water pollution, climate change, etc.). While both subjects have been analyzed on their own, this study focuses on their nexus. Existing research highlights that many right-wing populist parties (RWPs) show in one way or another denial towards (anthropogenic) climate change. To understand this denial and its possible impact on climate change mitigation, I analyze how RWPs of Germany, Spain, and Austria frame the issue of climate change in their communication. Secondly, research agrees that in particular the mainstream parties (mostly the big parties left and right of the political center) influence the public and therefore it is central to understand possible (inter)relations of RWPs and mainstream parties in the climate change discourse. Thus, the second part of this research project concentrated on the development of the concept of climate change in the communication of mainstream parties.
In a first step, drawing on the methodological apparatus of the discourse-historical approach in critical discourse studies, I study how, when and in which context RWPs use the climate change discourse. In a second step, in the light of the literature on party competition and applying a discourse conceptual analysis, I examine possible correlations of a climate change-skeptical communication of RWPs and a possible change of the climate change discourse of established parties right and left of the political center.
This analysis will center on the development of discourses in the context of climate issues over a longer period of time. Specifically, I will compare various documents (social media posts, press releases, parliamentary debates, policy documents) over time to study climate change discourses of various political parties in three European countries. The focus lies on the communication towards the public, thus on their Facebook and Twitter posts, as well as on their press releases or party outlets. The time span of the analysis ranges between 2016 and 2020, after RWPs gained power in various EU member states and the issue of climate change has become very salient in European media and politics.
Results show that the national relevant RWPs increase their social media communication on climate change when its salience in society increases. Moreover, RWPs typically deny anthropogenic climate change and expresses concern about climate protection policies. Furthermore, the analysis reveals whether established parties show a discourse shift in their communication and their framing of climate change after RWPs take up the issue and express denial towards climate change and corresponding policies. This research project shows how important it is to investigate certain actors and their communication towards the public as well as to understand the processes and possible relations behind them to comprehend and influence policy framing and decision-making processes.",European Academy of Bolzano,,,,,,,,European Academy of Bolzano,,Mirjam Gruber,,,,,,,,Mirjam Gruber,,Political Parties,Populism,Social Media,Climate Change,Communication,Comparative Perspective,,,Climate change communication in a time of populism.,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65022&EventID=185
0,"The National Climate Protection Initiative (NKI) in Germany provides a strong external incentive for municipalities and districts to develop local climate mitigation strategies and to become climate labs with their own climate change mitigation management. Yet, the latest evaluation of the NKI confirms that there is a great disparity in the distribution of funding across the regions. Taking this regional fragmentation across regional climate mitigation management in Germany as a starting point, we explore climate change mitigation management across local governments, identifying characteristic features and asking: How can we explain disparity in the amount of funding for climate mitigation management across districts?
In order to answer the research question, we draw on climate policy literature pointing to the role of socio-economic and institutional determinants rather than the role of actors. Accordingly, using data from the German Federal Ministry for the Environment on climate funding in the context of the NKI, we study 400 cities and districts to systematically test hypotheses concerning the disparity in the likelihood of urban versus rural areas to apply for climate funding, as well as the amount they receive. Further, we take socio-economic data from the regional statistics offices, Eurostats, the umbrella organization of the district parliaments, and the websites of the city parliaments. With multilevel ordinary least squares (OLS) and logistic regression, we show that in most districts there is still no climate protection management in place despite Germany’s climate protection goals and funding scheme. Our analysis indicates that the existence and quality of the climate management correlates with the level of urbanisation in a district, whereas structural or partisan factors seem to have less influence. We argue that despite an increasing number of local climate labs, there is important unused potential for climate mitigation in districts. In order to tap into these potentials, we propose a new research agenda focusing on climate mitigation in rural areas.",Otto-von-Guericke University Magdeburg,Universität Bern,Würzburg Julius-Maximilians University,,,,,,Würzburg Julius-Maximilians University,,Michael Böcher,Marlene Kammerer,Ulrike Zeigermann,,,,,,Ulrike Zeigermann,,Environmental Policy,Green Politics,Local Government,Regionalism,Climate Change,,,,Climate labs versus unused potentials: Examining the rural-urban divide in local climate mitigation,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65213&EventID=185
0,"Policy integration is widely recognized as crucial to governing of societal challenges cutting across a wide array of societal sectors, such as climate change. In this paper, we develop a new and more nuanced understanding of how climate policy integration may work in sector-specific decision-making procedures. Combining a processual understanding of climate policy integration, with the institutional logics tradition within neo-institutionalism, this paper develops a concept that enable us to analytically capture and understand a broad array of integrative efforts. Integrating climate policy within the agricultural sector has been deemed crucial by both policymakers and researchers, but such integration is not straightforward. This paper specifies three different ideal models of climate policy integration in the agricultural sector: multifunctional, market failure and net-zero. Empirically, the paper finds a remarkable shift in models over time in climate policy integration within Norwegian agricultural policy, from 2006 to 2021. The multifunctional model dominated for many years, although the governmental actors also eventually came to promote a market failure understanding of climate policy integration. Eventually, a net-zero understanding was introduced by the Norwegian government, but the agricultural organizations continued to promote a multifunctional model of integration.",CICERO,,,,,,,,CICERO,,Katrine Skagen,,,,,,,,Katrine Skagen,,Institutions,Climate Change,Policy Change,Policy Implementation,Empirical,,,,Climate Policy Integration in Agriculture: From a multi-functional to a net-zero in Norwegian support negotiations.,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65780&EventID=185
0,"Populism research increasingly emphasizes the relationship between populism, climate change, and climate policy, and the political tensions between populist politicization and technocratic de-politicization of climate change. The impacts of right-wing populist’s impact on climate policies has received particular attention. In the US case, while the presidency of Donald Trump received tremendous attention in general, it also represented a culmination of the development in the Republican Party, for which climate skepticism has meanwhile become a major policy platform. At the same time, there has been growing interest in political and social sciences on the possibility of an emerging left-wing populism, though only slightly in connection with climate policy. However, especially recent developments precisely in the US case invite a closer inspection of the emergence and possibilities of a left-wing climate populism. This paper explores the relationship between left-wing populism and climate policy. To this end, it briefly recapitulates the basic characteristics of populism and its left-wing variants. Secondly, it examines plausible left-wing populist linkages to climate change mitigation as well as possible contradictions (such as the tension between populist producerism and ecological austerity). The main section investigates current political approaches to climate change and their significance for left-wing populism based on recent cases in the United States and the Green New Deal in particular. Finally, the paper discusses whether climate change could be a solid platform for left-wing populism at all, and whether the US case provides indications of an emerging left-wing climate populism and how far it is likely to be transferrable to other contexts.",Technische Universität Darmstadt,RWTH Aachen University,Technische Universität Darmstadt,,,,,,Technische Universität Darmstadt,,Jörg Kemmerzell,Jared Sonnicksen,Veith Selk,,,,,,Veith Selk,,Civil Society,Populism,Social Movements,USA,Climate Change,Activism,,,Climate Populism on the Left?

0,"The contribution of this article is an examination of the policy fault-lines within a climate risk discourse that make a riskification process possible at the local level. Securitization theory is used to analyze the case, and in particular the parts of securitization theory that address riskification. The case study analyzed in this paper shows that the framing used widens the scope of legitimate actors that takes part in the climate risk management at the local level in comparison to climate change adaptation. New actors such as the industry and business department within the municipality is included. At the same time, the issue becomes one of consequences of potential events and related uncertainties because that is how risk is conceptualized and characterized. The uncertainties are those of what the future climate locally will be, and if the consequences will occur in the climate scenario. The course to reduce uncertainties is to increase knowledge about the local effects of climate change. This is done by bringing in scientific communities to estimate for example future torrential rain patterns and sea level maximum height in different sea states. In addition to knowledge, tools to manage and govern the risk are vital components of the solution. Hence, while the number of actors involved in climate risk handling is widening, the way the issue can be spoken about, and the potential solutions narrow.

0,"The 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) lie at the heart of global sustainability. While the achievement of the goals is considered an indivisible whole, evidence suggests they are neither integrated nor jointly implemented. Among them, SDG1 aims to end global poverty with 7 underlying targets and 13 indicators. At the same time, efforts to tackle climate change have significantly increased over the past years, but a global response accelerating transition, integrating climate action into the broader sustainability agenda is still missing. Consequently, attention has been paid to how the two agendas can be governed in an integrated way through institutional interlinkages in multi-level political settings. The coherent governance of synergies and trade-offs between the two agendas clearly has transformative potential. However, even despite their interconnectedness, SDGs are still implemented in siloes, meaning that policy-making almost exclusively focuses on one sector or policy subfield and there has been little inter-sectoral and inter-institutional cooperation to date. 
Institutional interlinkages and interactions between the social, environmental and economic objectives of the SDGs are especially pressing in Sub-Saharan African countries with populations vulnerable to both poverty and climate impacts. The lack of synergistic integration in sustainability governance potentially hinders broad societal transformation especially in the climate-poverty nexus. On the one hand, climate efforts not aligned to poverty eradication policies may be maladaptive, potentially worsening poverty and leading to less effective responses to climate change. On the other hand, pro-poor strategies that are based on carbon-intensive economic growth will amplify climate change. Synergistic governance of the climate-poverty nexus is therefore of key importance; however, we know surprisingly little about how trade-offs can be transformed to synergies in a global South context. 
This paper offers a systematic meta-analytical review, exploring existing literature on interlinkages, trade-offs and synergies in Sub-Saharan African countries, with a specific focus on the climate-poverty nexus. The paper asks the following questions: i) how can synergies and trade-offs be identified in a cross-sectoral multi-level setting, ii) what do we know about the interconnectedness of actors and institutions in the climate-poverty nexus; precisely what is the nature of these interlinkages across sectors and scales in Sub-Saharan Africa, and most importantly, iii) whether and how synergies contribute to broader societal transformations, specifically how climate commitments support or hinder poverty eradication under the 2030 Agenda.

In more general terms, the paper makes a significant contribution to advance the field of SDG interlinkages by arguing that synergies and trade-offs between policy subfields are crucial in addressing pressing global challenges in the intersecting fields of climate action and sustainable development. Additionally, the paper investigates how the synergistic governance of interlinkages may have a catalytic societal transformative potential in a global South context - establishing the integrated, indivisible whole of the SDGs that the 2030 Agenda calls for.",Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam,,,,,,,,Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam,,Eszter Szedlacsek,,,,,,,,Eszter Szedlacsek,,Africa,Development,Environmental Policy,Governance,Integration,Developing World Politics,Climate Change,Policy-Making,"Climate-poverty nexus in Sub-Saharan Africa: the transformative potential of governing SDG interlinkages, synergies and trade-offs",https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65271&EventID=185
0,"Consociational democracies rely on a system of power-sharing between groups to manage ethnic conflict and nationalist strife. Elections by proportional representation allow ethnic groups to be represented by their respective elites (Lijphart 1977; McGarry & O’Leary 1993; Norris 2008). By creating a direct electoral link between ethnic group members and their representatives, each representative is institutionally incentivized to represent their co-ethnic group members’ interests. In other words, consociationalism is premised on the assumption of co-ethnic group representation.

However, even though Lijphart’s consociational theory is over 50 years old, hitherto little is known about the process of political representation of ethnic groups in deeply divided societies. Much research has focused on the institutional features of consociationalism with a particular emphasis on federalism, but much less effort has been devoted to understanding the process of ethnic group representation, and in particular the link between the descriptive and substantive representation of ethnic groups. Hence, the extant research has not yet tested the hypothesis that members of ethnic groups behave as substantive representatives of their co-ethnic group interests.

To test this hypothesis, we study the process of representative claim-making (Saward 2010) on behalf of ethno-linguistic groups in the Brussels Capital region of Belgium. The Brussels region is divided into two official language groups, Dutch and French speakers, and the Brussels Parliament has proportionately reserved seats for Dutch- and French-speaking MPs (Deschouwer 2012; Janssens 2018). However, the Brussels case is particularly interesting because Brussels voters can hold MPs from the other ethno-linguistic group electorally accountable. Contrary to the rest of Belgium, where voters can only support parties and candidates belonging to the same ethno-linguistic group, cross-ethnic voting is possible and does occur in Brussels (Blanckaert, Caluwaerts & Erzeel 2021). Hence, while we would expect co-ethnic claim-making to be the norm in Brussels, at least some MPs receive electoral incentives to make representative claims on behalf of the other ethno-linguistic group (i.e. cross-ethnic claim-making), or make claims transcending the particular interests of either ethnolinguistic group (i.e. non-ethnic overarching claim-making). 

An exploratory claim-making analysis of parliamentary questions between 2009 and 2019 in the Brussels Parliament will reveal (1) to what extent Brussels MPs engage in co-ethnic, cross-ethnic or overarching claim-making, and (2) how this varies according to the partisan and ethno-linguistic identities of the MPs as well as the incentives they receive from the electoral and institutional context.",Vrije Universiteit Brussel,Vrije Universiteit Brussel,Vrije Universiteit Brussel,,,,,,Vrije Universiteit Brussel,,Benjamin Blanckaert,Didier Caluwaerts,Silvia Erzeel,,,,,,Benjamin Blanckaert,,Ethnic Conflict,Parliaments,Representation,Empirical,,,,,"Co-ethnic, cross-ethnic or non-ethnic overarching claims?

0,"In the wake of the global sustainability agenda implementation, collaborative sustainability research has been actively endorsed at many institutional levels. Co-production of research and action, transdisciplinarity and actionable science have been incentivised and heavily invested in - seen as an ‘epistemic imperative’ for the politics of sustainability. However, neither sustainability nor collaborative research are sedimented phenomena; they are both infused with conflictual interpretations and take diverse conceptual and practical forms along the political and scientific spectra. Furthermore, the logics by which ‘knowledge’ and ‘action’ come together vary widely across disciplinary perspectives, contexts and actors. Evidence suggests that these conflicts between interpretations, logics and practices, if not acknowledged, potentially hinder the contribution of collaboration processes to ’sustainabilities’. However, there is also evidence that, if acknowledged and understood, these conflicts can promote reflexive sustainability governance by opening up political processes at various levels and creating spaces for change. 
This article examines the logics linking knowledge and action employed by sustainability research financiers, and what kinds of collaborative sustainability research they potentially enable. Empirically, the article engages in two levels of sense-making analysis. First, it analyses four Swedish public research financiers’ interpretations of the overarching sustainability and collaborative research imaginaries reflected in the respective national policies, and how these interpretations shape the financiers’ research funding profiles and research calls. Second, it looks at how the research community responds to these calls and fills them with meaning. The article draws conclusions on what implications the existing logics and practices of public research funding may have for the contributions of collaborative sustainability research towards ‘sustainabilities’.",Södertörn University,,,,,,,,Södertörn University,,Tatyana Sokolova,,,,,,,,Tatyana Sokolova,,Environmental Policy,Governance,Institutions,Knowledge,Narratives,,,,Co-producing ‘the future(s) we want’: Political imaginaries and conflicting logics of linking knowledge and action in collaborative sustainability research policy,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63875&EventID=185
0,"Recent studies have found that voters use coalition heuristics to make inferences about party positions. When parties cooperate, they are perceived as closer together in an ideological space than when they compete. So far, this mechanism has only been tested at the national level and researchers have largely disregarded the complex interaction between parties competing and cooperating at various levels of a federal state. A German citizen is continuously exposed to different coalitions in her own state, in neighbouring states, and at the federal level. In this paper we argue that this complex multi-level system should have an influence on the perception of voters, especially for coalition parties. More specifically, we hypothesize that voters will perceive those national parties as closer to each other on a left-right scale that are in government in their state even though they are not members of the same coalition at the national level. We test our hypothesis by relying on the GLES 2016-2020 panel study. By doing so, we will not only analyse how regional government participation influences the perception of parties at the national level but also test what kind of consequences change in government participation at the regional level has for this perception.

In respect to the former, the motivation for the use of economic sanctions stems from the desire of policy makers to change the behaviour of a target state. However, given the low effectiveness of economic sanctions, literature has suggested that economic sanctions are in fact imposed to address the expectations of the domestic audience and, consequently, the motivation is symbolic. In this article, I assess this argument and study whether a political leader experiences a domestic audience boost for imposition of economic sanctions. Unlike other studies, I also test whether multilateral efforts offer an additional increase in popularity and, following crisis bargaining literature, whether issuing an empty threat results in a domestic audience cost.

0,"The paper explores, for a theoretical/ conceptual perspective, a relatively new phenomenon, known in the community of research and practice as “influence operations”, “information warfare”, “computational propaganda”, “disinformation 2.0”, or “cognitive warfare”. We premise our conceptual work on the ideas that the new threats to the integrity of public discourse in liberal democracies emerge in a completely changed communication and information environment, driven by the technological factor (explosion of social media/ digital platforms), and the geopolitical factor (interconnectedness of the global information space, and loss of monopoly over the global information space from Western actors). The aims of the paper are to compare and discuss existing conceptualizations of this phenomenon, to provide arguments in favor of the idea that the term “cognitive warfare” best describes the consubstantiality between contemporary propaganda efforts and the new technological eco-system and to propose a working conceptual framework for researchers, policy-makers and practitioners alike. We show that cognitive warfare is a continuous, at-peace battle over the human mind, integrating cyber, information, psychological, and social engineering capabilities. Thanks to technological possibilities, it may target influential individuals/ decision-makers, specific groups, and large numbers of people, selectively or serially. Its final goal is to polarize, disrupt and strategically shape public discourse so as to kill the very possibility of debate and to render the opponent ungovernable.

0,"Global governance structures are increasingly described as highly complex, fragmented, and polycentric. In many issue areas, the creation, design, and effectiveness of different types of global governance institutions are fundamentally shaped by how these institutions interact with other institutions operating in their domain.

In this paper, I contribute to closing this research gap.

0,"Studies of policy processes in higher education show how implementation processes are neither linear nor rational, often instead marked by unintended and ambiguous results (Gornitzka, Kogan, & Amaral, 2005). This is not unique to higher education, classic studies on implementation show how any reform implementation usually involves interpretation and discretion on ‘shop floor’ level. At the same time, governments are in a perpetual search for ‘what works’ in governance arrangements, to contribute to more effective steering that can deliver intended results. One means is to a larger extent involve the stakeholders and sector in reform development and governance processes, expecting that this would strengthen legitimacy and reduce implementation costs, an approach that has been labelled as ‘collaborative governance’. Collaborative governance implies involvement of stakeholders in formal, consensus-oriented decision-making processes concerning policy development or implementation (Ansell & Gash, 2008, p. 544). In this paper, focus is on examining how such collaborative approaches may be employed in the context of higher education, the dilemmas that emerge in design process, and the potential consequences this has for policy outcomes. 
The empirical setting in this paper is the introduction of multi-annual performance agreements in higher education in Norway.

Dialogue and consensus-orientation between stakeholders has been an important characteristic of higher education policymaking in Norway (Bleiklie & Michelsen, 2012), yet the pilot concerning the development of the contracts introduced a number of new ideas, as the representatives from the sector were involved as co-constructors of the performance agreements as new governance instrument. The analysis highlights the consequences of temporal sequencing of the development process into three stages, the varying and rather consequential effects of the very open-ended approach from the ministry, the interaction of the new governance instrument with existing instrument ‘mix’, and the role of various other concurrent developments. As such, the analysis points out a number of dilemmas, both around the introduction of performance agreements, as well as those inherent in using collaborative design and implementation approaches in higher education policymaking.","Nordic Institute for Studies in Innovation, Research and Education",,,,,,,,"Nordic Institute for Studies in Innovation, Research and Education",,Mari Elken,,,,,,,,Mari Elken,,Governance,Higher Education,Policy Implementation,Policy-Making,,,,,Collaborative design of governance instruments in higher education,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63942&EventID=185
0,"How can international organizations without substantial bureaucratic structures gain collective agency and independence from their member states? In contrast to full-fledged international organizations, horizontal regulatory organizations (HROs) in global environmental and financial politics lack extensive bureaucracies and are dominated by their (state and non-state) members. Examples include the Basel Committee of Banking Supervision (BCBS) or the Convention on Biodiversity (CBD). Despite their horizontal design, these organizations display varying degrees of collective agency that cannot be reduced to individual activities of their member. We argue that specialization in otherwise horizontal IOs generates organizational autonomy even without large bureaucratic structures. To support this argument, we first outline a concept that elucidates the origins of organizational agency in the absence of delegation to administrations. We argue that organizations gain agency, if they are authorized to make governance decisions, such as regulation, and if they acquire some autonomy (develop a specific organizational rationale). Second, we develop causal mechanisms showing how, and under which conditions, horizontal organizations can gain autonomy through functional differentiation and specialized organizational bodies, despite close control by their members. Third, we introduce a new dataset for the empirical assessment of the presence of decision-making authority and autonomy-generating institutional arrangements for 40 horizontal organizations in environmental protection and financial market regulation.",University of Bamberg,University of Bamberg,Freie Universität Berlin,Freie Universität Berlin,,,,,University of Bamberg,Freie Universität Berlin,Michael Giesen,Thomas Gehring,Simon Linder,Thomas Rixen,,,,,Michael Giesen,Thomas Rixen,Environmental Policy,Governance,Institutions,Political Economy,Global,International,Climate Change,Differentiation,Collective Agency of Horizontal Organizations: Specialization as an Institutional Source in Global Environmental and Financial Market Governance,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63448&EventID=185
0,"Current diagnoses of ""democratic regression"" (Schäfer/Zürn 2021) in European Union member states play out before the backdrop of national historical narratives. Compared to the status quo ante, regressive developments signal a loss of democratic quality, which is why they seem puzzling from a normative point of view – especially in countries in which liberal democracy is a hard-won achievement after a history of manifest injustice. One way to make sense of regressive developments is to look at them from the perspective of the historical self-understanding of overcoming injustice. With David Art (2006), we can distinguish ""cultures of victimization"" from ""cultures of contrition"", but this distinction has so far only been applied to the politics of memory of domestic injustice, not to the legacy of the colonial past. Similarly, M. Rainer Lepsius proposed to look at ""internalising"" and ""externalising"" strategies in the politics of memory. I explore whether the two distinctions can usefully be applied to recent controversies among European nations about relating to past colonial injustice.",Universität Hamburg,,,,,,,,Universität Hamburg,,Peter Niesen,,,,,,,,Peter Niesen,,Democracy,European Union,Ethics,Normative Theory,,,,,"Colonial victimization and colonial contrition: their place in ""democratic regression""",https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63319&EventID=185
0,"Most countries in this world have stood in a colonial relation with other countries at some point. Colonialism involves political and economic domination over a dependent territory and was internationally legitimated by a supposed entitlement to conquer and control on the basis of racial or civilizational superiority. In fact, European constitutional states developed within systems of colonial law from the beginning. These states had the power to shape a global migration regime to further their own interests which continue even today. However, the discussion of immigration ethics has mainly focused on global distributive justice. Advocates for open borders often justify international mobility rights by appealing to some distributive standards, such as global equality of opportunity or mere sufficiency. Relatively sparse attention has been paid to the implications of global ractificatory justice for immigration policy. Reference to past injustice can supplement arguments for global distributive justice by providing additional justification for condemning present injustices. Equally important, the continued non-rectification of colonial injustices constitutes an essential part of the present distributive injustice at the global level. In this paper I argue that former colonial states have a reparative duty to extend the option of full membership to the current members of former colonized communities living outside their borders. 
The duty to include is grounded on the collective duty on the part of the former colonial states to make amends for the historic injustices caused by colonialism and for the continuing non-rectification of such injustices. There are other possible measures of reparations. However, the duty to include is one appropriate response to colonial injustices as it tracks a distinctive wrong of colonialism—that is the creation and imposition of political association that denies members equal and reciprocal terms of cooperation. Not only have the former colonial states failed to rectify the harms of colonialism, they also failed to meet their associative duties, including robust distributive duties to share fairly the benefits deriving from their political association with the colonized peoples, which obtained during the colonial period. Dramatic inequalities among different societies, which are shaped by a shared history of colonial domination and exploitation, make citizenship a significant determinant of a person’s life chances. On the one hand, there is substantial empirical evidence indicating that migration is effective at reducing global poverty for the migrants themselves and the sending countries. On the other, Western affluent states often exploit the unjust disadvantages facing the former colonized peoples to to “cherry pick” potential migrants. In addition, the offer of full membership from the former colonial states tend to take seriously the agency of the current members of formerly colonized communities. They are not forced to stay home and wait for development assistance nor are they forced to migrate abroad.",Hong Kong Baptist University,,,,,,,,Hong Kong Baptist University,,Kevin Ip,,,,,,,,Kevin Ip,,Citizenship,Political Theory,Immigration,,,,,,"Colonialism, Reparations, and the Duty to Include",https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64344&EventID=185
0,"Much of what we learn through the media and other sources about politics, economics, history, environmental and health issues originates in specialized expert knowledge. While it is often taken for granted, in times of crisis, such as the present pandemic, the power of expert knowledge in shaping (and challenging) public policies and public opinions becomes most tangible. In the context of West European and North American democratic societies, the questions of how crisis-related expert knowledge is produced and communicated have been studied extensively. However, we still know exceptionally little about the origins and contents of such knowledge, its communication channels, and effects in non-democratic political environments. This study addresses this gap by focusing on a specific group of expert knowledge producers and communicators, namely Russian think tanks established under the auspices of the presidential administration and the government. Centered on Russia as a case of consolidated autocracy, the paper compares state-linked think tanks’ discursive responses to two protracted crises with different degrees of salience in the Russian public space: the Covid-19 pandemic and the climate change crisis. The study specifically examines what kind of messages state-linked think tanks try to convey to policymakers and to the public; what strategies and channels they use to communicate these messages to their audiences; and whether different channels are used to convey different information. 
Methodologically, the paper employs semi-structured expert interviews with selected think tankers and a subsequent content analysis of these interviews as well as of publications available on the think tanks’ websites. The interviews are used to reveal the think tanks’ communication channels and strategies as well as messages they are trying to convey to policy-makers in the non-public domain of their activities. The content analysis serves for identifying discursive frames used by think tankers to emphasize different dimensions of the Covid-19 and the climate crises. To “capture” the crisis frames, the study operationalizes them as the combination of four elements, suggested by Entman (1993): problem definition, causal interpretation, moral evaluation, and response recommendation.
Preliminary findings suggest that there is a considerable variance in how think tanks discursively approach the Covid-19 and the climate crises. In some cases, Russian state-linked think tanks have openly endorsed national authorities’ crisis response and discursively normalized the critical situation in Russia, while overemphasizing problematic developments elsewhere in the world and thus shifting attention in the public discourse away from domestic emergencies. In others, think tankers attempted objective analyses of the pandemic and climate change, concentrating more on the domestic challenges and policy evaluation. This variance is rooted in the intraorganizational dynamics of the think tanks, which largely determines whether they become legitimizers of state actions or remain neutral crisis communicators.",University of Vienna,,,,,,,,University of Vienna,,Vera Axyonova,,,,,,,,Vera Axyonova,,Public Policy,Knowledge,Climate Change,Communication,Comparative Perspective,,,,Communicating Crisis in Illiberal Environments: Russian Think Tanks between Policy Evaluation and State Endorsement,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64119&EventID=185
0,"The European public sphere has been under study for more than two decades. During the same period of time, successive political crises have shaken the European Union. They have had inconsistent or even paradoxical effects with respect to the emergence of a transnational public sphere. Recent trends have been discussed using the interwoven developmental terms of Europeanisation and politicisation. By impairing traditional gatekeeping mechanisms and national container logics of industrialised media systems, social media such as Twitter have arguably served these trends by facilitating the formation of more fluid transnational issue publics. This paper takes up some of these strands and studies the temporal and time-varying integration of issue publics on Twitter during the major crisis Europe (and the entire world) is currently going through: the Covid19 pandemic. Do we observe new trends of transnational integration in Europe’s societal debates? Or do we see more nationally structured debates and communicative insulation driven by institutional nationalism in political crisis management? If overarching trends remain inconsistent, which correlations between the course of the pandemic and crisis management on the one hand, and transnational communication on the other can be observed? How do national user communities differ in this regard?
In order to study these questions, we rely on Twitter data obtained from the TBCOV database, i.e. a dataset for multilingual, geolocated Covid19-related Twitter communication. We selected corpora for the 27 member states of the EU plus the United Kingdom. We defined three research periods representing different phases of the pandemic, namely April (1st wave), August (interim) and December 2020 (2nd wave) resulting in a final set of corpora comprising 51,893,966 unique tweets for the comparative analysis. In order to measure the level and temporal variation of transnational discursive linkages we conducted a spatiotemporal network analysis of so-called Heterogeneous Information Networks (HINs). HINs allow for the integration of multiple, heterogeneous network entities to better represent the complex discursive structures represented in social media debates. For the initial construction of our HINs, we utilised different sorts of automatically extractable entities, namely hashtags, mentions, named entities, URLs and retweets, that correspond to different dimensions of discursive linkages. For our variable metrics, we counted instances for each of the discursive linkages represented by meta-paths via one of the entity types. Therefrom, we obtained an aggregate measure of transnational linkages on a daily base by relating these linkages back to their geolocated authors. Furthermore, we utilized the Covid Stringency Index, a day-wise composite measure based on indicators like school openness, work related restrictions and travel bans, to check for correlations between national crisis management and (trans-)national communication patterns on Twitter.
Preliminary findings suggest that the share of transnational discursive linkages correlates with the severity of the pandemic. Moreover, transnational linkages are higher during the second than during the first wave, indicating effects of institutionalisation. Stringent political measures of crisis management at the domestic level (such as lockdown decisions) seem to provoke stronger national structuration of Covid19-related Twitter discourse.",Hildesheim University,Hildesheim University,Hildesheim University,Ruprecht-Karls-Universität Heidelberg,,,,,Hildesheim University,,Wolf J.

0,"Contemporary European societies are governed by institutions and actors on various government levels, taking the shape of an integrated structure of multilevel governance. Whether citizens perceive these governing political institutions as legitimate is a key question. Indeed, although legitimacy is far from being a new concept (e.g. Weber, 1968), it has attracted renewed attention over the course of the last two decades, in particular in a context marked by the development of multilevel governance.  Yet, studies typically focus on institutions on only one or two levels. Hence, scholarship still lacks a comprehensive understanding of the concept of legitimacy in a multilevel context, as well as an integrated empirical approach to investigate the interaction between legitimacy beliefs in this multilevel context. The absence of a deep understanding of the relationship between citizens’ beliefs about the various governance levels they are subject to is problematic, as the multilevel setting has a profound impact on legitimation dynamics. Our paper aims to fill these conceptual and empirical gaps. We ask to what extent citizens perceive political institutions at the subnational, national, regional (i.c. the EU) and global level of governance as legitimate, on what normative grounds their legitimacy beliefs are constructed and how they relate to each other? Moreover, we ask how variation in citizens’ perceptions of legitimacy in this multilevel context be explained. 
To do so, we have fielded an original cross-national survey in eight European countries which vary in the extent to which multilevel governance has developed and is contested. In this survey, we included original questions to measure perceptions of legitimacy in a multilevel context both in terms of normative justifiability – in citizens’ own terms – and in terms of consent. These questions were developed (and pre-tested) to improve formerly used operationalizations of legitimacy (e.g. trust and support), assessing the strengths and limitations of these operationalizations against our conceptualization of legitimacy beliefs. Our cross-national survey thus enables us to study how legitimacy beliefs towards different institutions on different levels relate to each other, not only in terms of evaluation but also regarding their normative contents. Moreover, the survey is set up to allow us to investigate explanations for variation in legitimacy perceptions across levels. We test hypotheses regarding the national-institutional context, as well as individuals’ identification, utilitarian considerations, political attitudes and experiences. The study contributes to our understanding of how citizens view politics as it is organized today, dispersed across governance levels.",Université catholique de Louvain,Université catholique de Louvain,Maastricht Universiteit,Université catholique de Louvain,,,,,Maastricht Universiteit,,Thomas Laloux,Virginie Van Ingelgom,Soetkin Verhaegen,Alban Versailles,,,,,Soetkin Verhaegen,,Comparative Politics,European Union,Governance,Local Government,Regionalism,Global,Survey Research,,Comparing and explaining legitimacy beliefs towards political institutions in a multilevel context,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65609&EventID=185

0,"Electoral competition is one of the basic indicators of the quality of democracy, as free party competition or contestation is one of the fundamental conditions of democracy. This is reflected in Dahl’s (1971) dimension of liberalization, which refers to the extent to which political opposition is able to compete for power. Therefore, as long as the party system is viewed as a system of interactions arising from interparty competition (Sartori 1976), the quality of those interactions represents the central focus of quality of subnational democracy in the dimension of competition. The present paper aims to contribute to a better understanding of regional-level party politics in post-communist Czech Republic and Poland. We follow the multilevel election perspective, which emphasizes that full understanding of regional-level electoral competition and the resulting shape of regional party systems is only possible when taking horizontal and vertical interactions between regional and other electoral arenas into consideration (Golder et al. 2017), i.e., the effects of vertical spill-over between the national and regional arenas as well as horizontal spill-over between various regional arenas (Schakel and Romanova 2021). We analyse data on electoral competition in all regional elections from the establishment of self-governing regions in Poland (1998) and the Czech Republic (2000) to the last regional elections in 2018 (Poland) or 2020 (the Czech Republic) in 14 Czech regions (kraje) and 16 Polish voivodships (województwa) and compare type of the party competition at the regional level against the form of party competition at the national level in a long-term comparison. The main goal of the paper is to examine especially three main research questions: What types of party systems have emerged in the Czech and Poland regions? How stable are they? Is it possible to identify some form of vertical spill-over between national and regional party systems (vertical spill-over) or does the development in one or more regional arenas impact on the shape of party systems in other regional arenas (horizontal spill-over)?",Jan Evangelista Purkyně University in Ústí nad Labem,,,,,,,,Jan Evangelista Purkyně University in Ústí nad Labem,,Pavel Maškarinec,,,,,,,,Pavel Maškarinec,,Europe (Central and Eastern),Comparative Politics,Elections,Local Government,Party Systems,,,,Comparing electoral competition at the subnational level: vertical and horizontal spill-over in Czech and Poland regional elections and their impact on multilevel democracy,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65328&EventID=185
0,"Vietnam and Bangladesh are two emerging lower middle-income economies with aspirations to become high income countries in next twenty years. Both have export-oriented economies with a potential of manufacturing and service sector growth and projections of high electricity demand. The rapid growth of demand and depletion of indigenous resources has led both countries to undertake an energy transition. However, in spite of their relatively similar energy paths from the 1980s through the 2000s, with electricity market reforms starting in the 90s, and similar energy challenges, the energy transitions of Vietnam and Bangladesh have unfolded differently since 2010. While Vietnam is rapidly growing solar power (26% of installed capacity by 2020), the country cancelled its nuclear power plant (NPP) in 2016. In contrast, in Bangladesh installed solar power capacity is still below 2% and the country has started construction of a large-scale NPP in 2017.
Here we seek to explain why Vietnam is adopting solar power while Bangladesh is adopting nuclear power. Using a most similar case study design and qualitative analysis we explore whether this is a case of crowding out (as one energy suppresses investment of the other) or the outcome is a result of combination of other political, techno-economic and socio-technical mechanisms.
Our preliminary findings indicate that the divergence between the energy paths of the two countries is not the result of intentional crowding out driven solely by the state, but rather combination of causal mechanisms in which external actors played important roles. Vietnam attracted solar investors to the country by offering a lucrative feed-in tariff (FITs) after China and Thailand had let similar FITs expire. The FIT success in Vietnam followed the Communist government’s state-led marketization. In contrast, Bangladesh with 50% of the electricity supplied by the private sector and a market-oriented economy could not benefit from the market led net-metering policy despite proving its capacity to have the largest off-grid solar power program in the world. This is because it lacked infrastructural support, incentives to regional solar investors and as yet could not transfer long experience of installing off-grid solar technologies to on-grid technologies.
The divergence in nuclear adoption can be explained partly due to distinct relationships with international actors. Bangladesh adopted highly expensive NPP, not because of its economic advantages, but because of strategic cooperation between the government of Bangladesh and Russia, aspiration to be a nuclear country, its symbolic value of development, and regional history of adopting nuclear by neighboring countries like India and Pakistan. Whereas, South East Asian neighboring countries of Vietnam have a history of not adopting nuclear. Vietnam could cancel the NPP even after investing millions of dollars because of its conglomerates’ stronger coal connection, growing potential to import coal from Russia.
Our contribution speaks to the under-researched question of energy transitions in the global south and on the technological periphery. We see that the divergence of energy outcome of Vietnam and Bangladesh can be largely explained by the role international actors play in shaping their energy transitions.",Central European University,Universitetet i Bergen,Central European University,,,,,,Central European University,,Aleh Cherp,Jessica Jewell,Moshahida Sultana,,,,,,Moshahida Sultana,,Asia,Development,Political Economy,International,Climate Change,Technology,Energy,Energy Policy,Comparing Electricity Transitions in Emerging Economies: Nuclear Growth in Bangladesh versus Solar Growth in Vietnam,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64575&EventID=185
0,"Policies continuously pile up in modern democracies. Organizations tasked with their implementation are confronted with the challenge to cope with an ever-increasing and more complex number of tasks. So far, the ability of organizations to cope with an expanding workload cardinally has been linked to hard resources — budget and staff. Yet, whether an organization is able to maintain its capacity despite a higher implementation load significantly depends on its ability to efficiently mobilize and distribute resources internally. Strikingly, however, this aspect has not been addressed systematically so far. We still lack analytical concepts that allow us to empirically capture changes in agency capacity at the aggregate level. We also lack theoretical explanations that might account for variation in accumulation-induced capacity losses across countries, sectors, or different implementation bodies. In this paper, I propose a new approach to address these research gaps in two ways. First, I develop a novel concept of capacity loss caused by policy accumulation allowing for the comparison of changes across organizations, sectors, and countries. Second, I suggest a new theoretical argument accounting for change in capacity. Centrally, I claim that organizational capacity gains or losses can be attributed to two factors, namely (1) agency legacy — internalized routines and structures that are difficult if not impossible to change and (2) agency management — organizational strategies that can be changed by reform, different leadership, or problem pressure. Third, I provide  an initial test of the conceptual and theoretical considerations by a most similar systems case study of the English Environment Agency and the Irish Environmental Protection Agency.",Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München – LMU,,,,,,,,Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München – LMU,,Dionys Zink,,,,,,,,Dionys Zink,,Comparative Politics,Environmental Policy,Institutions,Public Administration,Policy Change,Policy Implementation,,,Comparing policy accumulation induced capacity loss in public sector organizations,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65740&EventID=185
0,"It is crucial to understand the dynamics of phase-outs of non-sustainable energy carriers to accelerate the decarbonization of the economy in hindsight of the climate crisis. Taking the German example, the exit of nuclear energy as a successful policy is compared to the phase-out process of coal power to provide new insights on such policy change. The historical pathway of each phase-out policy is examined as the basis for the comparison. In general, the German nuclear phase-out is driven by a strong anti-nuclear sentiment in the public and as a political strategy whereas for the exit of coal the socio-ecological movement, a severe drought in 2018 and a deep institutional academic and non-academic knowledge transfer for the climate crisis were the main drivers. The examination together with the deductive thematic analysis enables then to identify commonalities and differences of the two phase-out policies that manifest themselves in the following dimensions: institutionalization, visibility of impacts, public image, and incumbency. The ethics committee of the German nuclear phase-out in 2011 was a pivotal institutionalised actor in fostering the final exit. Its reasoning resonated in the public delightfully as it changed nuclear powers image and provided the argumentative pathway for the then chancellor Merkel to turn around her energy politics. Based on the acquired learnings, a convocation of an ethics committee to evaluate the moral implications of the climate crisis is able to foster the acceleration of future fossil fuel phase-outs.",TU Berlin,,,,,,,,TU Berlin,,Tom Selje,,,,,,,,Tom Selje,,Political Economy,Public Policy,Qualitative Comparative Analysis,Comparative Perspective,Policy Change,Energy Policy,,,Comparing the German exit of nuclear and coal: Assessing the historical pathways with the deductive thematic analysis to identify energy phase-out dimensions,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63228&EventID=185
0,"Can deliberative democratic innovations like mini-publics reach their normative promises? This is a crucial and perennial concern for political scientists and policy makers, especially in a context of democratic malaise. A recent meta-analysis of the literature has suggested that the answer might be positive, though emphasizing that the empirical evidence remains small given the little number of studies on the topic (van der Does and Jacquet, 2021). Moreover, empirical studies are strongly divided between those focusing on the impact on the participants and those who focus on impact for the larger public, with no existing attempt to consider both sides of the coin at the same time and connect both strands of research. This paper bridges this gap by using an original panel study of the participants and the non-participants to a deliberative mini-public on climate protection in Luxembourg. In 2022, the Government of Luxembourg has decided to set up the “Klima BiergerRot (KBR)”, which is a Citizens’ Assembly on Climate. It gathers 60 citizens to deliberate about recommendations formulated to the Government and the Parliament for meeting the objectives of Luxembourg for fighting climate change. For the paper, we are using two panel surveys (before/after the DMP, with the same questionnaire simultaneously administrated for both groups), one with all participants to the citizens’ assembly (N=100 maximum: 60 active participants, 40 substitute) and one with a representative sample of the population of Luxembourg (N=1500 minimum, TNS as provider). The analysis will then compare how being exposed to a deliberative mini-public has affected participants and non-participants’ attitudes towards deliberative democracy, about representative democracy, and about democracy more widely. In doing so, we aim to provide an original contribution on the larger debate whether democratic innovations can reach their normative hopes.",University of Luxembourg,Université Libre de Bruxelles,Université Libre de Bruxelles,Université Libre de Bruxelles,,,,,University of Luxembourg,,Emilien Paulis,Jean-Benoit Pilet,Sebastien Rojon,Davide Vittori,,,,,Emilien Paulis,,Democracy,Political Participation,Public Opinion,,,,,,Comparing the impact of the citizens’ assembly on climate in Luxembourg on participants and non-participants.,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64718&EventID=185
0,"Populism has most often been examined from the supply-side of politics, as scholarship primarily focused on the rhetoric of populist movements, parties, and leaders. Most empirical research before the 2010s was based on qualitative approaches (e.g., Betz, 1994; Taggart, 2000; Mudde, 2007). Since then, an increasing number of studies take a more quantitative approach, as they delve into the study of both the supply- and demand-side of populism by using survey items to measure populist attitudes. Based on an ideational approach, that is, the belief that populism is a set of ideas, populism can be measured as an attitude that individuals can possess to a greater or a lesser extent (Rooduijn 2018: 364). This approach paves the way for examining populism, both at the demand and the supply side, with quantitative methods. Recent scholarship uses survey items to gauge levels of populism amongst individuals. These individual-level studies on populist attitudes form the foundation of the elite surveys and the expert surveys on populism. 
This paper intends to study and compare the positions of Greek voters, candidates and political parties on a number of issues related to populism through quantitative research. Relying on the data of 2019 Greek national election studies (i.e., candidate and voter surveys) and an expert survey we aim to answer the following research question: do voters share the same views on issues related to populism as the candidates and political parties they vote for? In addition, studying their opinions on immigrants, minority rights, social liberalism etc. we will identify right-wing and left-wing populism in both voters and political parties.   
However, as with any survey, some survey items may not work, so this paper’s goal is also to identify the survey items of populism that work and those that do not.
In this paper we use Greece as a case study; however, as many of the survey items used in these post-election studies have been used in surveys in other countries, this work contributes to the comparative research of populism and aims at encouraging scholars from other countries to include more survey items related to populism in their future election studies.",Aristotle University of Thessaloniki,Aristotle University of Thessaloniki,,,,,,,Aristotle University of Thessaloniki,,Maria Tsigkou,Ioannis Andreadis,,,,,,,Maria Tsigkou,,Elites,Populism,Candidate,Survey Experiments,Survey Research,Voting Behaviour,,,Comparison of the positions of voters and candidates on populism:  the Greek case,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65464&EventID=185
0,"This paper examines the distinctive trajectories of two systems of higher education.  Ukraine and Uzbekistan both gained independence in 1991.  In the Soviet period, both countries had systems of higher education dominated by the Russian language.  The primary language of instruction at flagship universities in both countries was Russian.  Academics in both countries shared strong intellectual and personal ties with colleagues across the Soviet academic landscape.  Similarly, at the institutional level, universities throughout the Soviet space engaged in close collaboration with one another.  After 1991, with the introduction of nationalist language policies, the higher education systems in both countries adopted distinctive paths forward.  Universities in Uzbekistan now have quite low rates of Russian language usage in the classroom.  We argue that the nationalist trend in Uzbekistan resulted less from a top-down effort to impose Uzbek as the language of instruction and more as a result of demographic shifts that have resulted in fewer and fewer Russian language students.  The nationalization by default path in Uzbekistan contrasts markedly with the Ukrainian case. In the aftermath of the Maidan movement in Ukraine, the state oversaw a campaign to limit the use of Russian in Ukrainian universities.  This top-down effort to enforce language use has met resistance from both students and faculty.  Drawing from interviews with faculty members and academic administrators at universities in both countries, our paper engages in a comparative analysis of both cases.",University of West Georgia,"V.N.Karazin National University, School of Sociology",University of West Georgia,,,,,,University of West Georgia,,Mikhail Beznosov,Artem Lytovchenko,Neema Noori,,,,,,Neema Noori,,National Identity,Nationalism,Policy Analysis,Political Sociology,Qualitative,Education,,,Competing Nationalisms:  A Comparative Analysis of Higher Education Language Policy in Ukraine and Uzbekistan,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63755&EventID=185
0,"Election pledges commit parties to implement certain policies and provide certain outcomes after an election. Although parties get little reward from voters and lose flexibility, parties regularly commit themselves to certain policies by making these pledges. In this paper, I examine why parties commit to such a high extent. I argue that parties make pledges to signal credibility to voters, when the party is close to competing parties’ positions. Compared to other campaign statements, election pledges can make voters more confident that parties will act on their words, so a party with more commitments will ceteris paribus have an advantage over other parties with similar positions on an issue. I test my expectation by manually coding election manifestoes from parties in Denmark, United Kingdom, and United States from the last three decades to measure the extent to which each party makes commitments on an issue. I find support for my argument by showing that the share of commitments increases when the average positional distance to other parties on an issue decreases.

0,"Power is the central concept of international relations and international politics. To categorize the various ways of thinking about power, there is a valuable taxonomy of four types of power, namely compulsory, institutional, structural, and productive. This understanding of power provides a framework to analyze China’s evolving engagement with UNESCO. UNESCO is the world’s largest intellectual platform and a controversial international organization. China has the peculiarity of a dual identity as a developing country on one hand and a major power and UNESCO’s largest contributor on the other. Therefore, power relations are more noticeable in China’s interaction with UNESCO. First, under UNESCO’s constitution, UNESCO’s compulsory power is mainly expressed in its independent budgetary power, that is dependent on large countries for contributions but equal in decision-making to large and small countries, making China, the largest contributor, a fragile power. Second, China’s institutional power is expressed though the General Conference proposals. Though China has been more actively participating in UNESCO affairs in the last decade, the number of proposals from China has been declining, while the wide groups of civil society in China has become more passionate as an institutionalized partner with UNESCO, which shows a shift of institutional power from the government to the society. Third, in terms of structural power, China has gradually abandoned the traditional developed–development, donor–recipient structural power and reshaped the bloc diplomacy based on country’s interests at UNESCO. Finally, UNESCO is one of the most influential knowledge-producing institutions in the world, hence China’s role is more of implementation of UNESCO’s norms and agendas, making China a subordinate of UNESCO’s productive power. Concerning future research, the interactive analytical framework of power could also be applied to analyze China’s interactions with other international organizations and observe the changes caused by Chinese influence on them.",Zhejiang University,,,,,,,,Zhejiang University,,Wenting Meng,,,,,,,,Wenting Meng,,China,International Relations,UN,International,,,,,Competition and Coexistence of Powers in the “Three UNs”: A Framework Analyzing China’s Evolving Engagement with UNESCO,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63362&EventID=185
0,"Only recently have scholars started to pay attention to the regional dimension of authoritarianism and democratization in the Middle East. Motivated by the growing literature that focuses on the role Russia and China play in “authoritarian promotion” and “diffusion”, scholars have explored the role of “learning” and regional organizations in authoritarian resilience and identified Saudi Arabia, UAE, and Iran as active authoritarian prompters or “Black Knights” who use various forms of economic, military, and political assistance to bolster authoritarian governments. This paper shifts the focus from simple authoritarian cooperation and promotion to a specific type of authoritarian support characterized by regional competition. In authoritarian competitive involvement, multiple rival countries intervene simultaneously and oppositely to support opposing sides during a democratic transition, namely the old regime or the military and the political group leading the democratic transition, influencing their behavior and preferences. Therefore, rather than focusing on patron-client interaction, I study the web of interactions among different external and domestic actors. 

Drawing on evidence from the democratic transitions in Egypt (2011-2013) and Sudan (2019-2021), I develop a theoretical framework for this type of international involvement. I argue that a counterrevolution and a democratic breakdown are more likely in a situation of competitive authoritarian involvement for two reasons. First, regional competition boosts the level and nature of the patron’s support to the old regime. This unconstrained and unconditional support enhances its repressive capacity, reduces the cost of repression, and hardens its negotiating position. Secondly, competitive involvement increases the threat perception of both other opposition factions and the military. This creates an extremely polarized environment in which growing inter-elite distrust and anti-democratic preferences can de-mobilize the opposition and further lower the costs of repression. In cases of typical authoritarian support not characterized by competition, the military is more likely to accept a power sharing agreement and thus counterrevolution attempts are less likely to succeed.  To investigate that claim, the paper leverages a controlled comparative analysis and draws extensively on Arabic language primary sources, including newspaper reports and articles, TV clips and interviews, official statements, NGOs reports, international media, and secondary literature.

This paper advances the literature on the international dimension of democratization and authoritarianism by introducing a novel type of international involvement and by explaining variation in the effectiveness of foreign sponsorship on regime survival, a question that remains under examined in the literature. In addition, the paper supports the increasingly salient claim that polarization matters in the study of democratization and repression. It also contributes to that literature by introducing a new dynamic source for political polarization and state repression rooted in the international environment, which goes beyond the focus on stationary material and long-term factors.",University of Toronto,,,,,,,,University of Toronto,,Salam Alsaadi,,,,,,,,Salam Alsaadi,,Comparative Politics,Contentious Politics,Democratisation,Regionalism,Developing World Politics,Qualitative,Political Regime,Protests,Competitive Support from Regional Patrons and Democratic Transitions,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=62763&EventID=185
0,"The arrival of large numbers of migrants in Austria seeking international protection after 2014 and their dispersal across the territory transformed existing and initiated new ‘arrival infrastructures’ (Meeus et al. 2019, 2020) and thus had a major impact on local governance regimes. In this paper, we focus on the role of non-governmental organisations and civil society initiatives in advocating for change and providing service, respectively (see Ataç & de Jong, 2017, Simsa, 2017). Focusing on four localities in Austria – a medium sized town, a small town and two rural municipalities and their surroundings – we can observe different types of organisations active in relation to migrant integration as well as different types of interaction with formal government levels as well as with each other. While both civil society organisations and service-oriented NGOs have been firmly integrated into local governance regimes in all four contexts, their shape, role and degree of autonomy differs remarkably between different contexts. In addition, we find that the geographical scope and location of organisations does not necessarily correspond to divisions of competences between different levels, highlighting the role of ‘networked’ forms of governance.  Our paper contributes to two research gaps in the literature: namely the relative absence of research on civil society actors outside of large cities and the focus of must research on their involvement in “emergency management”.

0,"One conceptualization of 'good representation' may be analogized as a kind of mirror on the populace. A 'perfect' political assembly, therefore, reflects both the political and demographic composition of the country without distortion. Progress toward more statistically representative legislatures is simple to measure in cases where there is only one under-represented group of interest; accordingly, we have tracked the slow but steady improvement in the presence of women and marginalized groups across liberal democracies. However, the descriptive representation literature has not yet settled on an effective method to describe and summarize under-representation among multiple subgroups of the population simultaneously. To this end, I propose a method derivative of the Gallagher index (used in measures of proportionality of electoral systems), which enables a summary statistic for multiple groups that is a multi-dimensional generalization of the gender gap. I then apply the measure to the representation of occupational class in the Australian Parliament (1985-2020) to show that, while the representation of women has improved significantly since the 1980s, the representation of occupational class has declined slightly. The method and findings contribute to a nascent literature that is concerned with the consequences of complex descriptive representation (for example, the interplay of gender and occupation) for the quality of democratic outcomes.",Australian National University,,,,,,,,Australian National University,,Patrick Leslie,,,,,,,,Patrick Leslie,,Elites,Gender,Parliaments,Political Methodology,Candidate,Party Members,Quantitative,Empirical,Complex Descriptive Representation: Proportionality of Occupation and Gender in Australia,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=62280&EventID=185
0,"Faced with a growing public backlash, Global Governance Institutions (GGIs) are more frequently engaging in discursive self-legitimation. The European Union is not only one of the GGIs with the most influence on national politics, but it is also one of the most publicly criticized. As a result, the European Commission has reinforced efforts to communicate its work. However, one crucial barrier to these attempts is the inherent difficulty of communicating the often highly technical decisions of the European Commission. As a result, communication attempts of the European Commission are exceedingly complex. What are the effects of this complex messaging on attitudes towards decisions of the European Commission? Possibly, such self-legitimation attempts may weaken instead of strengthening public EU support, as complex messaging may increase aversion towards the EU and reinforce perceptions of the technocratic nature of the institution. Past research has focused on the content of self-legitimation by GGIs. But this content must be understood by the public to have a legitimating effect beyond a small group of politically sophisticated individuals. Implementing a preregistered survey experiment in Germany (N = 1200), I investigate the effects of complex messaging on attitudes towards two infringement procedures against Germany instigated by the European Commission related to two directives: The Habitats Directive and the Electricity and Gas Directive. I show that more accessible language markedly improves support for the infringement procedures. This effect is especially strong for supporters of the EU and individuals with comparatively high or low education. An exploratory analysis of the impact of this treatment on emotional self-reports shows that less complex language does not lead to a backlash from EU opponents. This study's results could help understand the conditions under which the self-legitimation strategies of EU institutional actors are likely to be effective.",Westfälische Wilhelms-Universität Münster,,,,,,,,Westfälische Wilhelms-Universität Münster,,Paul Meiners,,,,,,,,Paul Meiners,,European Union,Communication,Survey Experiments,,,,,,Complex Language and Attitudes Towards the European Union: Communicating European Commission Infringement Proceedings,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63566&EventID=185
0,"I argue in this paper that intra-personal compromise plays an important but largely neglected role for political veganism. I further argue that even though compromising intra-personally can help vegan activists to achieve their goals, some compromises inevitably come with a moral cost that may not be acceptable to individual activists. 
According to recent empirical data, most vegan activists (henceforth V) consider the suffering of non-human animals to be the most important reason for living vegan, while only a minority considers other motives, such as environmental or health concerns, to be the most important reason for veganism (e.g., Kalte, 2021). It can therefore be said that raising awareness about animal suffering is of utmost importance to V. I call this the awareness-raising-principle, in short: principle (A). On the other hand, to reduce animal suffering, V also aim to promote veganism as effectively as possible. I call this the effectiveness-principle, in short: principle (E). 
However, principles (A) and (E) are not always compatible, i.e., they cannot always be simultaneously realized. More concretely, I suggest that an incompatibility arises in situations where V address an audience with pre-existing values that support veganism without reference to animal suffering, e.g., a concern for protecting the environment, alleviating world hunger, or increasing public health. In these situations, the effectiveness-principle (E) requires V to promote veganism in terms of those pre-existing values rather than in terms of animal suffering, which is notoriously difficult to convey (e.g., Loughnan et al., 2010, Piazza et al., 2015; Rothgerber & Rosenfeld, 2021). However, realizing principle (E) in this scenario – catering to the audience, so to speak – inevitably means refraining from realizing principle (A). And vice versa, if V choose to realize (A), they cannot realize (E), since (A) is, in this case, not the most effective way to proceed.
This dilemma situation constitutes a classical scenario for intra-personal compromise. Because both principles are incompatible, V unavoidably have to sacrifice something, no matter which choice they make: If V choose to focus on animal suffering, they compromise principle (E), thus sacrificing effectiveness. And if V choose to tailor to the audience and exclude references to animal suffering, they compromise principle (A), thus sacrificing their most important value. 
Based on a cost-benefit analysis of both compromise options, I argue that compromising (A) comes with a distinct moral cost that compromising (E) does not entail: By promoting veganism for reasons other than animal suffering, V implicitly demote animals to mere means rather than ends in themselves, thus also betraying their moral value as sentient beings. I conclude that while both intra-personal compromises can support V in achieving their goal of reducing animal suffering, compromising E may be preferable to compromising A, given the unique moral cost that the latter entails for the individual vegan activist.",Université de Lausanne,,,,,,,,Université de Lausanne,,Friderike Spang,,,,,,,,Friderike Spang,,Political Participation,Political Theory,Social Movements,Political Activism,,,,,Compromising on incompatible values: The case of political veganism,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63638&EventID=185
0,"Bureaucratic nepotism —an undue preference for family members—undermines the merit-based systems for recruitment and promotion in public sector employment that are foundational for an effective, efficient, and legitimate public administration. Identifying the extent and depth of nepotism is crucial for launching public policies aiming to reduce corruption and enhance the quality of bureaucratic public service delivery, however it is difficult to identify and measure systematically. Existing empirical studies on nepotism struggle with the ambiguity of the concept and often fail to produce reliable and replicable measures. We contribute to understanding the link between the concept and the measures of bureaucratic nepotism from two angles. Conceptually, we unpack the nepotism definition into three components: a family tie, the preferential treatment to get a job or promotion, and the lack of qualification. We assess the operationalization of these components in three of the most common measures in the literature: matching surnames, declaration of family ties and perception surveys. We find that none of the measures alone meet the validity, reliability, and replicability criteria. Empirically, using original data, we provide an assessment of the three measures in the context of the Mexican judiciary, an institution long signalled for having this problem. We find that the three measures partially capture different aspects of the same underlying phenomenon. We discuss the pros and cons of each measurement and how they relate the concept to the empirical approach. This suggest that future empirical studies on nepotism should consider complementary perspectives to build a reliable and replicable measure as a starting point to explore its effects on the public administration performance.",Kings College London,,,,,,,,Kings College London,,Luis Fernando Soto Tamayo,,,,,,,,Luis Fernando Soto Tamayo,,Latin America,Public Administration,Corruption,,,,,,Concept and Measures of Bureaucratic Nepotism: Evidence from the Mexican Judiciary,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64329&EventID=185
0,"The paper defines concepts as descriptions of types.   Using the intension and extension distinction it suggests that conceptual change can come about in two ways.  First, we can learn more about that to which our concept refers and so change our description of it.  This might involve discovering characteristics of the object that we thought were true of it but are not in fact true and/or so we realize it has sets of characteristics of which we were originally unaware.  The object itself has not changed, just our understanding of it.  Thus, our descriptions of the type changes.  The intension changes but the extension does not. That is one form of conceptual change.  

Second, the object itself can change as it develops. So, for example, the possibilities for governing change with technological change and so the object to which the term ‘the state’ refers to changes over time.  Correct descriptions of the state will have to reflect those object changes.  Here we note, that previous descriptions of ‘the state’ might no longer be appropriate to current states, but might still be appropriate to historical ones.  The former descriptions were not incorrect to their original referents, but now need to be modified for current referents. We can either claim we now have a different concept for the modern state or we can see them as the same underlying concept but with a referent that is evolving.  Which route we choose might depend on our research question and whether we do comparative static analysis or developmental analysis. 

These two types of concept change are relatively straightforward for concepts that apply to empirical types.  Only relatively straightforward however, since types do include non-actual but potential token examples.

For more normative concepts the same distinction in the two forms of conceptual change can occur.  We can discover implications of our normative account of which we were previously unaware.  Or our description can change as our moral understanding changes perhaps because of new empirical discoveries.  At the normative level, these two different types of aspects are often epistemically indistinguishable.  The one difference is that we might treat past uses of the concept within historical context as being appropriate for that context, even though our current understanding are judgementally applicable to past contexts.

This epistemic indistinction causes problems for any account of conceptual change for normative concepts. The paper concentrates on these problems, focusing on the idea that for normative concepts all we have are rival accounts.  Conceptual change does not make sense for normative concepts, only conceptual understanding having different historical moments.",Australian National University,,,,,,,,Australian National University,,Keith Dowding,,,,,,,,Keith Dowding,,Political Methodology,Political Theory,Analytic,Methods,Normative Theory,Theoretical,,,Concepts and Conceptual Change,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63516&EventID=185
0,"Politically motivated action by shareholders and other investors is variously labelled as shareholder activism, corporate activism, or socially responsible investment, and recognised as political participation under the banner of political consumerism. However, this inconsistent labelling and categorisation of investors’ activism as political consumerism fails to capture the unique role and diverse political participation of different types of investors. Moreover, while there is a considerable body of work on consumers’ political participation, investors’ political participation has received comparatively little attention. This is despite social movement organisations’ (SMOs) increasing use of investment-based tactics such as divestment campaigns, shareholder resolutions, and boycotts of financial institutions on issues including climate change, labour exploitation, and human rights abuses. 

This paper seeks to remedy the rhetorical blurring and limited conceptualisation of investors’ political participation by defining and developing the concept of ‘political investorism’ to serve as a cohering term for investment-based political participation. Drawing upon illustrative cases from Australia, we use process-tracing to map the political participation of investors and shareholders, and the mobilisation strategies used by social movement organisations. We find a diverse range of tactics and identify key hallmarks and categories of ‘political investorism’. We argue that situating the discourse around the term ‘political investorism’, as a concept distinct from but related to political consumerism, provides essential clarity to examine the unique role of investors as political actors. Recognising key differences between consumers’ and investors’ political participation will help to guide future examinations of investment-based political participation at a time when shifts in global governance and limitations on more traditional avenues for political participation are amplifying the importance of market-based activism for social change.",University of Technology Sydney,Queensland University of Technology,Queensland University of Technology,Queensland University of Technology,,,,,Queensland University of Technology,,Martijn Boersma,Justine Coneybeer,Erin O'Brien,Alice Payne,,,,,Erin O'Brien,,Political Participation,Social Movements,Climate Change,Mobilisation,Political Activism,Capitalism,,,Conceptualising investors’ political participation,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=62753&EventID=185

First, it argues against attempts to stretch the concept so that it covers not only restrictive measures but any type of action that aims to defend democracy. Second, it identifies MD with the principle and practice of exclusion; this broadening of the concept allows tracking its presence not only in the legal domain –as a practice of rights restrictions– but also in the political and societal domains –as a practice of cordon sanitaire and media censoring respectively. Third, it distinguishes justifications for MD as grounded respectively on three principles: (1) reason, (2) sovereignty, and (3) harm. It concludes by suggesting that, despite their differences as to what justifies pre-emptive exclusion, all MD theories share a similar conception of democracy: as instrumentally justified, substantive and value driven.",Uppsala Universitet,,,,,,,,Uppsala Universitet,,Anthoula Malkopoulou,,,,,,,,Anthoula Malkopoulou,,Democracy,Political Participation,Political Theory,Voting,,,,,Conceptualising Militant Democracy,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64441&EventID=185
0,"Paper proposal for consideration of panel 3 on ‘Political Parties and Party Competition in Multilevel States’.

The rise of regional government has induced a great scholarly interest into the question whether regional authority impacts on territorial inequalities regarding policy outputs and outcomes (Toubeau and Kleider 2022). Two key characteristics of this literature is that scholars tend to include federal (Austria, Belgium, Germany, Switzerland) and regionalized (Italy and Spain) countries and the main independent variable is often incongruence between regional and national governments. In this paper we argue that existing measurements of incongruence are neither reliable or valid indicators of government incongruence. Our criticism concerns two main caveats which arise out of insufficient knowledge about regional electoral systems and the relationships between regional parliaments and executives. For example, a focus on executives is not sufficient to tap government incongruence and one need to include parliaments as well. For example, in Italy and France regional presidents head the regional executive and exercise all executive powers but they also always rely on parliamentary majorities even in Italy where regional presidents are directly elected. 
	Second, the inclusion of unitary and more centralized countries is necessary to find the scope conditions under which regional authority and government incongruence (can) produce territorial inequalities regarding policy outputs and outcomes. Importantly, parliamentary-executive relations differ substantially from those in regions in federal and regionalized countries as well as those at the national level. For example, regional executives may be dual and include centrally appointed officials (Dutch provinces) or regional executives share authority with another central authority in the region (counties in Norway and Sweden). In some regions, the mayor is not only the head of the regional executive but is also the chair of important and obligatory committees of the parliament (Danish regions) whereas in other regions the regional executive is single headed but its decisions need to be cleared by a centrally appointed official (French regions). 
Finally, through exploratory analyses we reveal significant variation in parliamentary-executive relations and government incongruence across regions and countries, as well as over time. Furthermore, we tentatively assess how regional identity, regional authority, and regional electoral institutions relate to parliamentary-executive relations and government incongruence.",Universitetet i Bergen,Universitetet i Bergen,,,,,,,Universitetet i Bergen,,Arjan H.

0,"Parties’ collaboration with interest groups is both important and perilous for democratic governance. Interest groups can both strengthen (in their function as “democratic transmission belts”) and weaken the linkage between voters and representatives. As the erosion of traditional social cleavages has led political parties to interact with a more diverse set of interest groups, the risk of parties being sidetracked by interest groups has increased. The present article studies how parliamentary party groups manage this risk through so-called “lobbying safeguards”. These can be understood as rules and practices within the parliamentary group that help curtailing potentially problematic relationships to IGs. Through a series of semi-structured interviews with current and former members of both the National Assembly of Québec and the Parliament of Canada, we proceed to an exhaustive mapping of these practices. In a second step, we reflect on how the presence of such safeguards can be assessed in the context of specific policy issues. In this manner, we seek to contribute to studying how the party rationale impinges upon the relationship between the individual MP and the interest group.",University of Geneva,,,,,,,,University of Geneva,,Steven Eichenberger,,,,,,,,Steven Eichenberger,,Interest Groups,Political Parties,Lobbying,,,,,,Conceptualizing and Measuring Parliamentary Party Groups’ Lobbying Safeguards,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65044&EventID=185
0,"More so now than ever before – at the juncture of new and old resurfacing glocal crises – global citizenship education (GCE) is being framed as a pedagogical tool that can effectively address globalization and the interdependences and inequalities it generates. At the heart of such an education is a premise that claims that, if equipped with appropriate knowledge, attitudes, and skills, self-realization of “global citizenship” is possible, and consequently, students can begin thinking and acting beyond their local circumstances to address global challenges. However, as with any other education, if seen as neutral or normative, global citizenship education and the concept of “global citizenship” it proposes may reproduce harmful (un)acknowledged assumptions about the world. Consequently, as seminal work by Pashby points out, when approaching GCE, one should always ask “for whom and by whom” is GCE designed, who profits from it, and who does not. Making use of the postcolonial concept of hierarchization, this study aims to show that GCE puts into place particular discursive strategies that delineate who is the “global citizen” that can act as the “subject” and who is constructed as the “object” about which knowledge is being produced, thus, recreating the ages-old Self-Other binary. To demonstrate the existence of such colonial binaries, the method of Critical Discourse Analysis is applied to the case of Slovak GCE. By pointing out the presence of particular discursive strategies of activation-passivation, personalization-impersonalization, generalization-specification, this study, thus, reveals that, like every citizenship, the idea of “global citizenship” in GCE is based on the idea of who does and does not belong, who can become the “global citizen” and who cannot.","Faculty of Social and Economic Sciences, Comenius University",,,,,,,,"Faculty of Social and Economic Sciences, Comenius University",,Kristína Rankovová,,,,,,,,Kristína Rankovová,,Citizenship,Global,Qualitative,Education,,,,,Conceptualizing Global Citizenship in Global Citizenship Education: Who Can Be the Global Citizen?

A fuzzy-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (fsQCA) with 17 carefully selected decision-making processes in four IOs (FAO, WHO, ILO, UNESCO) shows that all international bureaucracies studied can be influential in favourable contexts. Autonomy of will allows IPAs to substantially influence policies, even in adverse contexts. Low autonomy of will, among other factors, explains why IPAs cannot exert influence, while autonomy of action appears largely irrelevant. In-depth post-QCA case studies reveal that stakeholder trust in the administration and the salience of a decision for the entire group of stakeholders are additional explanatory factors.

0,"Recently, autocratization processes have increasingly attracted scholarly attention. Although researchers have chosen countries as units of analysis, the literature on regime internal variations demonstrates that autocratization can develop at subnational levels. Accordingly, we claim that autocratization can be successfully opposed at the local level. The article shall thus focus on the role of capital cities in autocratizing countries. We argue that this perspective can help shed light on overlooked aspects of regime developments. In fact, we will look at how urban spaces can constitute ‘democratic enclaves’ which may reverse autocratization. Grassroot participatory initiatives on the use of urban public space or open assemblies on budget spending are among the examples of these localized practices of re-democratization.
After introducing the theoretical framework, the paper will map divergent regime developments at the subnational and national level in Southeast Europe (SEE), i.e. the trajectories of hegemonic and opposition forces in the national and city-level executives. Then, it will explore three case-studies: Budapest, Banja Luka, and Zagreb. They have been chosen as capitals of SEE countries experiencing recent autocratization or democratic backsliding. In fact, under the longstanding leadership of, respectively, Viktor Orbán and Milorad Dodik, Hungary and Republika Srpska have embarked upon an autocratization path over the past decade, whereas Croatia has been marked by a less severe, albeit noticeable, democratic backsliding. Nonetheless, these cities also represent typical cases of opposition’s victory in the capital, against the dominant parties at the central government: Gergely Karácsony’s broad anti-Fidesz coalition in 2019 in Hungary, Draško Stanivuković’s Party of Democratic Progress and its allies against Milorad Dodik’s forces in 2020 in Bosnia’s Republika Srpska, and finally Tomislav Tomašević’s Yes, We Can! movement, which surprisingly defeated the Croatian Democratic Union at the 2021 Zagreb local elections. With insights from case-specific literature, and interviews with experts, the paper aims to answer two research questions: which were the drivers of the opposition victory in Budapest, Banja Luka, and Zagreb? More generally, which conditions can enable the opposition to turn an electoral victory in the capital into a wedge to effectively resist and reverse statewide autocratization? 
We shall test the hypothesis that the opposition’s strategies for winning elections in multilevel polities are shaped by what we label as the ‘nationalization-insulation’ dilemma: at the urban level, the opposition might decide to ‘nationalize’ the political contestation and present itself as the anti-establishment alternative, to win mayoral elections by rallying ’round the flag’ in a larger front against the authoritarian incumbent. However, this strategy might equally penalize the opposition in future national contests, since the incumbent party often relies on strong rural basis and statewide support, while the opposition’s legitimacy mainly derives from being entrenched in the capital. Overcoming this dilemma, namely being able to both ‘nationalize and insulate’, is pivotal to win elections in multiple layers, and thus oust autocratic actors.

0,"Transparency and participation are two of the prime means of democratization. The status of citizen participation in public debates of good governance has been described as ‘sacrosanct’ (Day 1997), the significance of transparency as ‘quasi-religious’ (Hood 2006). This applies in particular to the environmental policy field, where influential pressure groups have pushed very strongly for a ‘participatory turn’ and public access to information, leading to a codification of these demands in national, European and international conventions and policy guidelines. How to actually deliver on participatory and transparent policy-making is far from straightforward, however. Democracy scholars have pointed out repeatedly that citizen participation usually suffers from a class bias and is not necessarily particularly democratic or ‘good in itself’ (Brown 2009, 223). Besides, research has emphasized that the effect of transparency may be negative (de Fine et al. 2011, 5) and indeed paralysing when it promotes demagoguery, misinformation and rigidity.
Against this background, this study asks how to make the most of transparency and participation. More precisely, it discusses how to design democratic innovations in such a way that they combine meaningful, democratic participation with a non-paralysing openness of governance, without jeopardizing other democratic values. Based on democratic theory, the study first underlines why transparency and participation potentially clash with other important sources of democratic legitimacy, such as efficient conflict resolution and fair and equal deliberation. In a second step, it is shown under which institutional conditions such tensions are moderated, using empirical examples of democratic innovations from the environmental and climate policy field and paying special attention to the disenchantment that public engagement practices generate among the involved citizens.",Johannes Gutenberg-Universität Mainz,,,,,,,,Johannes Gutenberg-Universität Mainz,,Eva Krick,,,,,,,,Eva Krick,,Governance,Political Participation,Climate Change,Policy-Making,,,,,"Consolidating participatory, transparent policy-making in the environmental and climate field",https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64185&EventID=185

The author not only detects the main political actors which used the Soros conspiracy theories but also offers main meta-narratives used within Slovak political discourse. The study found that extreme-right and populist actors (K-ĽSNS, Sme rodina) have been detected as proponents of this political strategy, but also a traditional left-wing social democratic, Smer-SD has utilized and incorporated conspiracy rhetoric into their political speeches. The author argues that the conspiracy rhetoric is necessary to examine in a broader context of so-called “cultural wars” that divides society and it contributes to undermining a very fragile Slovak democracy. Finally, the contribution would like to discuss the critical thoughts on the role of traditional political parties, which gave opportunities to populists and extreme-right forces, and de facto unintentionally contributed to legitimizing conspiracy rhetoric as such.",Palacký University,,,,,,,,Palacký University,,Lubomir Zvada,,,,,,,,Lubomir Zvada,,Democracy,Extremism,Political Parties,Populism,Qualitative,Mobilisation,Narratives,,"Conspiracy theories about George Soros: actors, narratives and implications for Slovak politics",https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64970&EventID=185

Taking Simmel's notion of triadic constellations of competition seriously and combining it with insights from valuation studies (Waibel et al. 2021) and the theory of social fields (Krause 2018), our paper advances the current conversation on competition in three ways. 
First, we develop an analytical framework for multiple competition. Most of the recent liter-ature on competition assumes – like Simmel – that actors are involved in a plurality of com-petitions. However, the focus is usually on an abstract concept of competition, on the pene-tration of contemporary society with a competitive template, or selected competitions. In contrast, relations between various competitions are not systematically theorized. To fill this gap, we propose an analytical framework that captures such relations as interrelated triadic competition constellations.
Second, the perspective allows to analytically capture competing as something actors do. The focus on competing distinguishes our approach from recent positions in organizational sociology (Arora-Jonsson/Brunsson/Hasse 2021), which assume that competition cannot be understood as a specific form of action. Indeed, actors do not necessarily respond in a standardized way to a competitive situation. However, our analytical approach allows us to understand heterogeneous courses of action as competitive behavior. We propose both a general typology of practices of competition and a more specific typology of competitive organizational practices in higher education.
Third, the perspective allows to elaborate the central role of comparative valuation in com-petition, which has been largely overlooked in recent literature (e.g., again in Arora-Jonsson/Brunsson/Hasse 2021), and thus contributes to linking the sociology of competition on the one hand with the sociologies of valuation and comparison on the other.

0,"How has the so-called refugee crisis from 2015 changed German national identity? Literature on German national identity suggests various master themes of responsibility, ethnicity, and guilt. While many existing studies have focused on singular snapshots of German identity, few have paid attention to processes of identity change. Moreover, the consequences of the 2015 arrival of refugees for German national identity remain to be studied in detail. This paper explores this question of identity change in the face of crisis through a qualitative content analysis of the most widely read German newspapers - Die Zeit, Süddeutsche Zeitung and Bild - as well as elite speeches on important memorial occasions. We argue that 2015 can be understood as a critical juncture for German national identity as the arrival of immigrants challenges notions of identity, triggering (in)formal boundary-making. Material from the years 2014 and 2019 serves as two reference points for German national identity before and after the arrival of refugees. Based on an inductive analysis of 1790 articles and 25 speeches and the identification of several issue areas, we find that the representation of national identity shifted from a relatively homogenous understanding of Germanness in contrast to European neighbours in 2014 to an increasingly fragmented focus on Others within the country in 2019. Based on these insights, we propose a theoretical framework on mechanisms of identity change in the face of external crisis.",European University Institute,European University Institute,,,,,,,European University Institute,,Selma Kropp,Wolfgang Minatti,,,,,,,Selma Kropp,,Citizenship,Contentious Politics,Integration,National Identity,Immigration,Qualitative,Refugee,,Constitutional Patriots or Ethnic Nationals?

0,"Many judicial systems utilize a process, often known as a ‘referral’ process, in which one court has the ability to call upon another court, particularly a superior court, for definitive interpretations of law. This referral process is perhaps most widely known from its use in the European Court of Justice, which has long thrived on receiving referrals (known as preliminary references) from national courts within the European Union. Yet, the ECJ’s preliminary reference process is itself derived from the constitutional referral processes previously adopted in several national judiciaries of the EU member states, notably Germany and Italy. In this paper we examine the constitutional referral process at the national level, using data from the German Constitutional Court and interviews with court officials to test different theories of why lower ordinary courts refer cases to their national constitutional courts. There currently is a lack of theory and empirical data examining why lower ordinary courts choose to refer certain cases to the national or federal constitutional court. Our study, then, is exploratory in nature, focusing on a variety of factors – including policy issues, legal doctrine, and regional court characteristics – that might influence ordinary court references.",Southern Illinois University,,,,,,,,Southern Illinois University,,Benjamin Bricker,,,,,,,,Benjamin Bricker,,Federalism,Governance,Courts,Decision Making,,,,,Constitutional Referrals to National Constitutional Courts: Examining the Reasons why Ordinary Court Judges Refer.,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64305&EventID=185
0,"The last decade has seen radical and rapid legislative change that has restructured the structural positioning of many disabled people. Within this context we have seen the political (mis)representation of disabled people in parliaments abound – with a proliferation and decimation of images, narratives and discourses. Claims to represent disabled people abound, yet these claims reveal the ubiquity of institutionalised ableism in elected legislatures resulting from the historic and systematic exclusion of disabled people from politics as both the representative and the represented. Yet the parliamentary politics of disability remains largely misunderstood and systematically overlooked in research. This endures despite seismic shifts in political representation studies, most notably an increased interest in how claims to representation (mis)represent the very groups they purport to represent. This recent turn has engaged scholars from across a number of disciplines in extensive theoretical and empirical discussions on political representation – redefining what we understand by representation and how it should be studied. From these discussions, we have witnessed the emergence of the constructivist model of representation, which views representation as dynamic and contested process wherein divergent claims to representation compete against each other, in contrast to the traditional models, where representation is seen as the translation of fixed demands into measurable acts. The constructivist lens has become commonplace in studies examining the political representation of women, ethnic minorities, and other marginalised groups, but it has yet to be explored in relation to the representation of disabled people. This paper reviews the constructivist turn in political representation studies in relation to disability, and assesses how renewed interest in substantive representation, mostly notably the claims-making thesis, can help us study the political (mis)representation of disability. Following this discussion, an alternative framework for conceptualising and analysing political representation in relation to the specific context of disability is outlined, with the express aim of capturing and evaluating the complex, contested nature of claims to represent disabled people in parliamentary arenas.",Central European University,,,,,,,,Central European University,,Ruth Gazso-Candlish,,,,,,,,Ruth Gazso-Candlish,,Political Participation,Political Theory,Representation,Constructivism,,,,,Constructing disability in parliament: Extending the constructivist turn to the political representation of disabled people,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64749&EventID=185
0,"The misogynist incel (involuntary celibacy) movement has increasingly been linked to violent attacks. The male supremacist ideology has inspired several perpetrators of mass shootings in the US, Canada, Germany, and the UK. Conspiratorial thinking, hate speech, and detailed descriptions of gendered violence are popular themes for the incel movement active in online platforms such as in Reddit, 4chan, and 8chan as well as in their own Incels.is forum. In this presentation, I describe how identities of ‘us’ and ‘them’ are being constructed in Incels.is forum discussions.

Recent studies on extremism acknowledge the connection between online subcultures and extremist violence. Can incel ideology be defined as an extremist ideology? Current research on extremism shows that fundamentalist views of in-group (us) and out-group (them) form the basis of extremist identities (see. i.e. Berger, 2018). Therefore, to examine incel movement in the light of extremism it is crucial to understand the mechanisms of group identity formation in online spaces. What are the mechanisms shaping in-group and out-group identities for members in incel communities?

To learn how the identities of ‘us’ and ‘them’ and ultimately an extremist in-group identity are formed in Incels.is forum, a qualitative discourse analysis examining the dimensions and strategies of othering and group identity formation was conducted. The data covers a time period from November 2019 to May 2019 and includes over 200 comments attracting the most attention and replies in the forum.

Preliminary findings indicate that incels’ in-group identity is based on self-victimisation constructed through; 1) narratives of social and sexual exclusion, 2) images of misogyny, and 3) conspiratorial thinking. Out-group is described in dehumanising terms and violence against the outgroup is seen inevitable and as a prerequisite for incels to succeed in modern society.

0,"This paper qualitatively explores a conceptual approach for ex-ante construction and evaluation of alternate policy mix pathways. Advances in the analysis of single climate policy instruments and of policy mixes have been made in energy system modelling (Koller et al. 2021), in conceptual work (Axsen et al. 2020) and in empirical ex-post analyses (Koch et al. 2019; Anderson/Sallee 2017). Political science and innovation studies analyses offer broad conceptualizations of designing policy mixes and to enhance policy mix characteristics (Rogge and Reichardt 2016). However, a conceptualization of dynamic climate policy pathways that integrates insights from engineering, economic and political perspectives is still missing. This paper builds on recent conceptual work on policy mixes for light duty vehicles (Axsen et al. 2020; Bhardwaj et al. 2020), to develop a tool for policy mix pathway construction, by focusing on intertemporal challenges. A fundamental notion of our approach is that policy pathways need to evolve and change over time. Technological system transitions undergo different stages: emergence, diffusion and saturation (or re-configuration) of zero GHG technologies, and associated behavioural, normative, political, legal, economics and business transformations. Scholars have argued that policy mixes need to evolve in order to address the inter-temporal challenges associated with each of these phases, and to enable these complex processes to unfold within the very short time spans of envisaged net zero transitions (e.g. Kivimaa 2019). We suggest that the LDV transport sector in Germany is moving from the emergent phase into diffusion stage. Alternative low-carbon technologies such as BEV are becoming more broadly available at significantly reduced costs. This requires policy instruments which actively place pressure on existing polluting technologies to displace them, rather than simply supporting the emergence of clean alternatives (Kern and Kivimaa 2017). This requires implementing stringent pricing/taxation which makes polluting technologies more expensive to buy and use, or stringent regulation which actively phases-out polluting technologies. We use Germany as illustrative case in order to apply our concept, and we derive alternative policy mix pathways which can accelerate the rate of diffusion/transition and deliver substantial GHG abatement in this sector.

0,"Energy transitions require engagement with users, local communities and wider publics in order to be fair, acceptable and, ultimately, successful. The development of Smart Local Energy Systems (SLES) is a key component of the UK’s industrial strategy around decarbonisation. As such, SLES projects, characterised by the integration of low carbon generation, demand sources and smart technologies in a geographically-defined location, provide important contexts for public engagement. 
 
Drawing on interviews with partner organisations in SLES projects of different size and scale, this research investigates the targets, methods and rationales of engagement from the perspective of SLES projects. Findings indicate that SLES project partners engage a diversity of users and community actors around multiple energy systems facets, using a variety of methods. This diversity is not correlated with project size or scale. Engagement practices are rationalised by project partners through the articulation of imaginaries of users, as well as associated imaginaries of engagement deemed appropriate for these actors. Engagement practices are conditioned by SLES project contexts – namely the technological and infrastructural boundaries, place contexts, and partnerships of actors involved in engagement. Such project constraints are also shaped by the wider programme within which SLES projects take place. 
 
Diversities in engagement reveals potential areas of tension between SLES projects and sustainable energy transitions more widely, with important policy implications. First, projects which only engage publics in a narrow sense, e.g. with specific types of users, or around individual technologies risk missing an opportunity to engage people around broader policy objectives relating to local or indeed national energy systems. Second, there is a missed opportunity for systematic social learning between SLES projects about what forms of engagement ‘work’ in different contexts, which can inform future policy initiatives. Finally, there is a need to consider how SLES programmes can be used to enable public engagement in system change beyond the boundaries of individual projects, contributing to broader policy goals around sustainability and environmental improvements.",University of Exeter,University of Exeter,,,,,,,University of Exeter,,Patrick Devine-Wright,Iain Soutar,,,,,,,Iain Soutar,,Democratisation,Qualitative,Climate Change,Technology,Energy,Energy Policy,,,Constructing practices of engagement with users of Smart Local Energy System: comparing emergent UK case studies of state-led decentralised energy,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=66065&EventID=185
0,"Newly established courts are presented with challenges in decision-making. Among these challenges is their relative lacuna of obvious judicial precedents from which they should draw upon in the judgments. This raises questions about how new courts go about constructing a new body of jurisprudence and the extent to which they borrow from external jurisprudence or other sources of law. The creation of new international courts in the 1990s and 2000s offers researchers opportunities to understand how courts build judicial precedent. In this paper, I consider the link between borrowing and construction of precedent. What shapes court’s decision to borrow, and from what sources do they borrow or not? To examine this question, I rely on original data of citation practices of three new international courts—the African Court of Human and Peoples’ Rights, the East African Court of Justice, and the Caribbean Court of Justice. The citation practices of these three courts speak to several key issues. First, the distinction between national sources of law and international sources of law sheds light on how new international courts legitimate their decisions by signally respect for national sovereignty while also interpreting and applying international obligations to fulfil their mandates. Second, courts can borrow binding and non-binding sources of law. This distinction relates to if and how courts build precedent with an eye toward constructing jurisprudence that is coherent with broader legal norms but that also accommodates its unique political and legal context. Last, the paper maps if and how these courts shift from borrowing of external sources to more active reliance on their own precedents and jurisprudence. Overall, this paper seeks to understand the considerations new courts take when constructing precedent and how practices of borrowing address them.",The London School of Economics & Political Science,,,,,,,,The London School of Economics & Political Science,,Theresa Squatrito,,,,,,,,Theresa Squatrito,,Africa,Courts,Decision Making,,,,,,Constructing Precedent through Practices of Borrowing,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63209&EventID=185
0,"In this paper we claim that to increase biodiversity we need constructive conflict. Even though biodiversity loss is related to many debilitating conflicts, conflict is also a positive factor in realising changes in human behaviour that leads to biodiversity improvement. Starting from the idea that conflict is inevitable, this paper deals with the question of how we can use conflict in a constructive way in order to support social learning, trust-building and finding integrative solutions in the context of biodiversity restoration. As nature conservation and restoration policies typically follow socio-ecologically defined boundaries of landscapes, people with different stakes and perceptions are confronted with each other which often leads to conflicts. The challenge is how to deal with these conflicts. For this reason, we explore the concept of constructive conflict to develop an analytical framework for interaction processes around biodiversity restoration.  Here we place constructive conflict in between hot and cold conflict. Hot conflicts are interaction processes in which people try to convince or coerce their perspective over others, whereas in cold conflict differences are suppressed and not made explicit. In contrast, in a constructive conflict parties not only express their views, but also listen to those of others, are willing to reframe their views during a conflict, and are wary not to take a decision before new insights on the problem or its solution have emerged. Dealing with conflict in a constructive way requires balancing several dynamic tensions. For example, you need sufficient diversity in order to support learning process. There should be a balance in the level of diversity so different perspectives are expressed but people still understand each other.  In this paper we describe and illustrate several of these balancing acts by drawing on the literature of conflict studies, governance & planning, interdisciplinary cooperation and organization & management studies and our empirical research in the field of biodiversity restoration. To conclude, we reflect on the possibilities and limits of these balancing acts for constructive conflict, while taking into account existing power structures and the broader institutional setting in which nature conservation and restoration processes take place.",Radboud Universiteit Nijmegen,Radboud Universiteit Nijmegen,Radboud Universiteit Nijmegen,,,,,,Radboud Universiteit Nijmegen,,Sabine Baumgarten,Judith Floor,Pieter Zwaan,,,,,,Judith Floor,,Conflict,Conflict Resolution,Environmental Policy,Governance,Knowledge,Decision Making,Policy Change,,Constructive conflict for biodiversity,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63825&EventID=185
0,"Covid-19 and the government measures taken to combat the pandemic have fueled populist protests throughout Europe. Social media played a key role in the emergence of these protests. This study argues that the topic of Covid-19 has triggered populist user comments on Facebook pages of mass media in seven Western European countries (AT, DE, FR, IT, NL, UK, SE). It asks how reporting about the Covid-19 crisis, and real-world aspects of managing the crisis have affected the scope of populist commenting on Facebook. Drawing on media psychology, this paper theorizes populist comments as an expression of ‘reactance’, sparked by repeated ‘fear appeals’ in posts about Covid-19. Since reactance results from restrictions of personal freedoms, this paper expects an interaction effect of reporting about the government measures and the actual stringency of the measures, which varied considerably in the selected countries. The paper derives several hypotheses from these claims and test them on a dataset of N=65,343 Facebook posts, posted between January 2020 and June 2021 on 21 Facebook pages of mass media from in seven Western European countries (AT, DE, FR, IT, NL, UK, SE), and about 3.5 million corresponding user comments. Automated content analysis methods were used to measure populist communication in user comments and message characteristics of the posts. For measuring populism, the comments were first machine-translated into German using the Google Translate API to allow comparability of the measurements. Secondly, a fasttext word vector model was trained on the full corpus of German-speaking text used in this study. Finally, this study implemented a method called Distributed Dictionary Representations (Garten et al. 2018) which augments short conceptual dictionaries with word vector information to obtain a gradual measurement of populist communication. To classify the posts along several categories, such as mentioning the topic Covid-19, government measures, or public health experts, this study developed and applied language-specific dictionaries. All measurements were carefully validated against a human-coded gold standard of 300 comments and 300 posts per language, coded by thoroughly trained native speakers. The paper uses real world data provided by the Oxford government response tracker. Hypotheses are tested using carefully modeled multilevel regression models.

0,"A rich literature has revealed the consequences of issue shifts towards topics owned by niche parties in a cross-national context. So far, however, the processes leading to the ownership of certain topics have been mostly disregarded. In addition, the effect of issue shifts in the European Parliament have been much less understood, although the European Parliament has recently seen a dramatic rise of radical right and populist parties (RRPP). 
We address these research gaps by focusing on direct communications expressed on Twitter by all Members of the European Parliament between 2014 and 2019 (over 3 million Tweets). Moving beyond manifesto data, we, hence, utilize the huge repositories of social media in a quantitative manner to study the salience shifts of parties in reaction to niche competitors. Structural Topic Models allow us to explore empirically the issues RRPP occupy in the European Parliament and to trace their communicative behavior dynamically. In particular, we reveal which parties ""appeal broadly"", which issues are owned by PRRP and how other parties might adopt issues owned by RRPP. 
By using Negative Binomial Regressions, we then link the patterns of issue diversity and the level of issue salience to the outcomes of the European Parliament election in 2019. Our results show that communicating about topics owned by RRPP has indeed a positive effect on election results for mainstream and left-wing parties. Other than expected, this effect is not moderated by political ideology. Even more, we observe strong negative effects if RRPP concentrate on typical right-wing issues.
We therefore contribute to the literature on party competition and electoral success, issue competition and issue ownership in the European Parliament and add a new methodological approach to study these issues.",Universität Stuttgart,Universität Stuttgart,Universität Stuttgart,,,,,,Universität Stuttgart,,Raphael Heiberger,Uwe Remer,Sara Schmitt,,,,,,Sara Schmitt,,Elections,Political Competition,Political Parties,Populism,Party Systems,Political Ideology,Big Data,European Parliament,Contagious populist radical right: The role of issue salience for electoral success in the European Parliament.,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64251&EventID=185

Artists and curators engage democratic publics and set special standards of sociability. So much so that museums are no longer sites of casual cultural enlightenment but rather experiential contexts in which democratic publics realize that social mores are transient phenomena. The paper speculates on the meaning of facts and events like Ai Weiwei’s attempt to reframe the image of the drowned Syrian child Alan Kurdi by portraying himself in the identical pose of Alan’s corpse on a shore, creating a copy of the original, but a quasi-identical copy with very special properties, namely, an object of aesthetic investigation that finds in contemporary art museums a public space where it could resonate. For the fate of the original image would have been different, it would have resonated in the formless ether of social media for one week or two and then die down in people’s transient private memories.

0,"Tragedy has been the oldest and arguably the most popular form of art work since its origins in the ancient Greek. Although we possess only a few examples of the original four forms, as Aristotle explained in the Poetics, tragedy’s political character, which is inherent in the question of justice, is still very much alive and as relevant as it was two thousand years ago. Thus, perhaps changed in its forms of presentation, tragedy and its narrative structure are yet to shed light on our contemporary political impasses. 
Following this line of thought this paper is based on the main argument that underlying the origin of tragedy is always a political crisis, rise of Peisistratus and his tyranny in Athens, which inevitably causes a radical social disruption. Thus, the basic purpose of the tragic narrative is to make the audience to confront the primary unjust actions of the authority by putting them into shoes of the wrong-doer. The purpose is simple; revealing the fine line between the personal benefit and the public good and warning about the disastrous results of mistaking the former’s immediacy for the latter’s communal achievement. Following this main argument, then, it is possible to claim that the function of tragedy is still valid if we are to understand our contemporary political crisis. 
With this thought in mind, the paper claims that the analysis of the movies, although not literary works in form, The Killing of a Sacred Deer of Yorgos Lanthimos and The Salesman of Asghar Farhadi, as two examples of contemporary tragedies are not only intriguing due to their cinematic form, but also critical to provide us a venue to explore today’s political and social tensions and conflicts as well as quests for justice.",Middle East Technical University,Middle East Technical University,Ankara University,,,,,,Middle East Technical University,,Ömür Birler,Ömür Birler,Duygu Turk,,,,,,Ömür Birler,,Political Theory,Narratives,Normative Theory,Political Cultures,,,,,Contemporary Tragedies: A Political Glance to the Cinematic Works of Farhadi and Lanthimos,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64419&EventID=185
0,"Ample research documents an intense politicization of the issue of (forced) migration in recent years. For Germany, it has been argued that conflicts have sharpened in the course of the rapid increase of asylum applications from 2015 onwards. Yet, empirical evidence focuses on large protest events or migration-related protest dynamics at the national level. The local level of contention around migration has so far rarely been systematically assessed, and hence, comparisons of migration-related protests across different localities and over time within Germany are still missing. This gap is remarkable since life worlds in general and protest activity, in particular, are strongly influenced by everyday experiences and practices in the immediate spatial environment, where individuals are socialized into groups, embedded in social networks, develop identities and perceive social reality. Against this background, we present evidence on patterns of migration-related protest in two middle-sized German towns between 2014 and 2018. We explore the dynamics of migration-related protest over time, including the salience of migration in comparison to other issues of social conflict, the dynamics of protest pro and against migration, as well as the interaction patterns of the actors involved. We begin with a temporal analysis of 582 protest events identified in local newspaper sources. Empirical evidence suggests latency periods before and after a period of visible mobilization activity around the “summer of migration” in 2015 – yet with marked differences between the two cities when it comes to the differentiation of pro and anti-migrant protest activity. From a perspective conceptualizing collective action as (civil society) networks, we thus ask how this cycle of contention is related to the structures of interaction among actors in each city. To do so, we collected the digital public communication (around 76,000 homepage posts, Facebook posts, and Tweets) of those actors who were involved in migration-related protests between 2014 and 2018 in each city. With that, we assume that digital platforms are essential tools of (interorganizational) political communication that render interaction patterns and thus social structure visible. We employ a comparative social network analysis based on these actors’ interactions in the periods before, during, and after visible mobilization activity (N = 877 references). This mixed-methods approach allows us to assess not only if and how the “summer of migration” 2015 has affected local conflict dynamics, but also if this supposed “critical juncture” in recent German history has lastingly modified the relational patterns of civil society in these two localities.",German Centre for Integration and Migration Research (DeZIM),University of Copenhagen,Freie Universität Berlin,,,,,,German Centre for Integration and Migration Research (DeZIM),,Elias Steinhilper,Matthias Hoffmann,Moritz Sommer,,,,,,Elias Steinhilper,,Migration,Social Movements,Social Media,Mixed Methods,Mobilisation,,,,"Contested Hospitality: Comparing local Dynamics of migration-related Protest before, during and after the “Summer of Migration” 2015 in Germany",https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65936&EventID=185
0,"Observing dynamics of contention and conflict in citizen participation processes challenges the assumption that practices of participatory democracy may ever fulfill the promise of an ‘inclusive consensus’. Contention and conflict in citizen participation remind us of the fallibility and indeterminacy/undecidability of democratic practices. In this respect, contention and conflict in the framework of citizen participation may constitute a vital challenge to ‘post-political’ practices threatening to reduce democratic participation to institutional dispositives and routinised choreografies of consensus mobilization. As agonism is the defining dimension of the political, contention and conflict are a necessary dimension of democratic politics and a key to reclaiming the emancipatory potential of politics.

However, the hypothesis of conflict happening ‘by default’ needs to be qualified. Observing the contentious dimension of citizen participation – the idea that “citizen participation could be understood as the quintessential example of conflicts by default” – reflects a significant empirical reality and resonates with a theoretical understanding of ‘the political’ as ontologically rooted in difference and agonism. At the same time, it poses a distinctive research challenge, as neither the emergence and dynamics nor the trajectories and transformative outcomes of conflicts can be defined deductively or deterministically. In fact, bridging theoretical perspectives and empirical analysis of conflicts represents a multidimensional and interdisciplinary challenge for research and analysis.

This paper addresses this challenge through an interpretive approach, based on combining post-foundationalist political theory with research on social contention and mobilization and with interpretive policy analysis. A social science perspective centered on social agency and the way actors attach meaning to social practices within a specific policy field is thus integrated with a post-foundational perspective on politics as a dialectics of hegemonic practices. This combined approach enables, on the one hand, to analyse the conditions for contention and conflict to emerge and develop in terms of the discursive and symbolic-cognitive practices of collective meaning-making involved in the expression of agonistic claims and of the forms of social mobilization and collective action by which agonistic claims are expressed. On the other hand, it enables to explore the capacity of social agency to (dis-/re)articulate a given policy situation and of transforming it into a new configuration through agonistic struggles. Contention and conflict are hence seen as expression of agonistic claims through processes of collective meaning-making, moments of collective identity formation, and the formation of new political subjectivities. Contention and conflict thus intended are emergent, interactive-relational, and co-evolutive phenomena which develop within specific socio-spatial fields of meaningful social practices, challenging and possibly generating alternatives to such socio-spatial practices.

The paper is intended as a tentative framing of the topic in view of the development of a research framework. Based on empirical observation of recent struggles in the field of urban policy in Berlin, it explores how contention and conflict in participatory practices – and the contestation itself of participatory politics – manifest themselves and develop in three distinctive fields of socio-spatial practice:
- challenging ‘invited’ forms of participation,
- addressing insurgent practices of ‘invented’ participation,
- contesting the ‘meta-politics’ of citizen participation.",Technische Universität Berlin,,,,,,,,Technische Universität Berlin,,Enrico Gualini,,,,,,,,Enrico Gualini,,Citizenship,Conflict,Contentious Politics,Democratisation,Critical Theory,,,,Contested participation:  Understanding agonistic struggles in the field of participatory urban policy,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65011&EventID=185

Previous studies have framed the EU leaders’ strategy that has led to the approbation of the Next Generation EU as a choice of polity maintenance, that is the attempt to safeguards the integrity and the effectiveness of the supranational political system.

Did they had represented an opposition against a political process that can define an embryonic form of transfer union? In case this opposition rhetoric effectively took place it is relevant to determine if it represented the opposition against a) new powers and competencies for the EU, and/or b) form of Intra EU solidarity, following the cleavage that oppose North vs South. The paper, studying a sample of parliamentary speeches by the means of a discourse analysis methodology, aims to determine if and how Eurosceptic parties within the European Parliament have implied an “anti- polity maintenance” rhetoric in order to weaken and undermine this anti-Covid-19 supranational strategy. Such a discursive approach would represent an ideational opposition against a policy-making decision that could boost EU legitimacy and authority, and at the same time, could strengthen an additional form of conditionality for member states that are going to receive financial aid.",Università degli Studi di Pavia,,,,,,,,Università degli Studi di Pavia,,Eugenio Salvati,,,,,,,,Eugenio Salvati,,European Union,Euroscepticism,Solidarity,European Parliament,,,,,Contesting European Union legitimacy within the European Parliament?

0,"This research seeks to understand how various conceptions of sovereignty are contested in liminal settings (Loh and Heiskanen 2020), i.e., in territories whose statehood is not acknowledged internally or externally (Visoka 2018). The chosen case studies are Northern Kosovo and the Åland Islands, neither of which can be considered as states per se, but both of which perform differing discourses on sovereignty and autonomy. Northern Kosovo is a case of overlapping statehood of both Serbia and Kosovo (Vulović 2020), and the Åland Islands is an autonomous region of Finland with close ties to Sweden. Northern Kosovo is examined as a case of performative sovereignty in non-democratic settings, while the Åland Islands can be considered a democracy. The aim is to answer how sovereignty discourses are performed in these contrasting settings and investigate the different actors who perform them. Looking at past referendums and formal and informal challenges to institutional routines in both contexts, as well as the erection of barricades by local elites with the support of organized crime in Northern Kosovo, the article also seeks to answer how an array of local actors challenge, contest and reinterpret hegemonic discourses on sovereignty.
Theoretically, this article combines performative statehood theory (Grzybowski and Koskenniemi 2015; Neumann and Sending 2021; Visoka 2018; 2019; Vulović 2020) with sovereignty research that understands the body as the performative locus of sovereign power (Agamben 1998; Bernstein 2012; Hansen 2005; Hansen and Stepputat 2005; 2006; Jagannathan and Rai 2015). This can be termed performative sovereignty. Here, sovereignty is understood as “a tentative and always emergent form of authority grounded in violence that is performed and designed to generate loyalty, fear, and legitimacy from the neighborhood to the summit of the state” (Hansen and Stepputat 2006, 297). Relying on Agamben (1998), sovereignty is not just about violence, but also about the production of a political order based on practices of exclusion. With this in mind, the article’s empirical focus is on individual actors that embody sovereign authority, who cannot be considered state actors in the traditional sense: regional assemblies, local political and economic elites, shady businessmen, organized crime, as well as average citizens who, out of fear or political persuasion, support these elites and perform their discourses. By conducting ethnographic fieldwork in local communities in Northern Kosovo and the Åland Islands, as well as interviews with local elites, and media analysis, I aim to shed light onto sovereignty performances as everyday practices of authority through both violence and exclusion from the political order. These performances, in turn, have tangible effects on how contested territories are governed, reinforcing their position of liminality.",University of Helsinki,,,,,,,,University of Helsinki,,Marina Vulovic,,,,,,,,Marina Vulovic,,Europe (Central and Eastern),Conflict,Local Government,Organised Crime,Comparative Perspective,,,,Contesting Sovereignties in Northern Kosovo and the Åland Islands,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63573&EventID=185
0,"We investigate the macro-social forces that shape the structure of public contestation across different types of news media and social contexts and consider their operation with regard to one of the most intractable social questions of our time: What is be the role of religion in public life, and what should it be? 
Using an original dataset of about 2 million contributions to this public debate in six countries (Australia, Germany, Lebanon, Switzerland, Turkey, and the USA) and in three types of media (printed newspapers, news websites, and political blogs), we examine the sociocultural and technological antecedents of inclusion and justification in public debate. 
We show how the democratic institutions (majoritarian versus consensus) and degree of cultural division (stable versus contested secularism) in a country shape whose voices get heard and how much public justification of public policy occurs. We also show how the shift from traditional to online debate impacts public discussion of intractable social problems and the significance of the transition towards a greater importance of user-driven opinionated discourse in public debate. 
In sum, this paper identifies the degree to which the sociocultural and technological contexts produce specific assemblages of actors, political positions, and justificatory practices in mediated public debate. These findings show how the capacity of public discourse to transform intractable societal conflict into robust debate is shaped by the political and technological conditions from which it emerges.",University of Leeds,Johannes Gutenberg-Universität Mainz,Universität Mannheim,,,,,,University of Leeds,,Eike Mark Rinke,Charlotte Löb,Hartmut Wessler,,,,,,Eike Mark Rinke,,Cleavages,Comparative Politics,Contentious Politics,Democracy,Media,Quantitative,Communication,Empirical,"Contexts of Contestation: Public Deliberation across Political Systems, Sociocultural Divides and News Media",https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64807&EventID=185
0,"Some authors, analyzing the Brazilian political and economic crisis that led to the impeachment of Dilma Rousseff, pointed to republican actions (anti-corruption) of the former president that would have impacted the support of the parties of the so-called “centrão” (parliamentary super majority formed by physiological parties) to the ruling coalition. We seek to analyze these actions in depth using the cases of the Ministry of Mines and Energy, the Ministry of Transport and the state oil company Petrobras, focusing specifically on the relationship between political parties and the big contractors. We did this based on three categories of analysis: political and technical appointments of bureaucrats to public office, schemes between the legal and the illegal to undermine competition in public contracts, and bureaucratic and political circulation of contractors. We used the plea bargains and investigations within the scope of Car Wash Operation, triangulating testimonies and documents. The results indicate historical changes in the relationship between the State and contractors from 2012 onwards, which changed appointments, cartel operation and anti-competition schemes before the start of the Car Wash Operation. This impacted the collection of “centrão” parties and increased suspicion about Dilma Rousseff, who acted to disrupt the schemes between legal and illegal that historically took place in infrastructure works in Brazil.",Departamento de Ciência Política FFLCH/USP,,,,,,,,Departamento de Ciência Política FFLCH/USP,,Daniela Costanzo de Assis Pereira,,,,,,,,Daniela Costanzo de Assis Pereira,,Elites,Interest Groups,Political Economy,Cartel,Coalition,Corruption,Lobbying,,"Contractors, politicians and bureaucrats in Dilma Rousseff's impeachment (Brazil)",https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64000&EventID=185
0,"For several decades, Belgium has been engaged in a twofold process of institutional transformation, combining federalization and Europeanization. The transfer of competencies to the regions and communities requires them to develop new political and administrative governance mechanisms that may or may not support European projects. This chapter analyzes two distinct moments of institutional reform: the takeover of science policy by the two large communities (in 1989) and the organization of the transfer of family allowance policy (2014). In the first case, the aim is to include scientific policies in the dynamics of the knowledge-based Europe in support of the extension of the intellectual property market; in the second, to restructure a social policy in order to (re)define the modalities specific to the welfare state, despite the pressure of budgetary austerity principles. In both cases, Flanders and Wallonia show very different trajectories in the development of new policies and administrative arrangements.
We propose to compare these developments in the two regions by asking how they do fit the expansion of ""neoliberal"" governmentality in one or both regions? One of the characteristics of a neoliberalization process would be an extension of market (or quasi-market) relations into parts of society or sectors of the state that were previously untouched by them. The creation of market structures is not a natural fact but a state fact, a recomposition of the state's modes of action (Bezes, 2009). In other words, the State itself reinvents its functioning and its technology of governement to support the expansion of the market logic (as in the case of intellectual property), that is, the production in a logic of competitive selection of decontextualized and mobile objects whose competitive qualities are made legible. In this context, it is then a question for the researchers of highlighting the rationality of government that is reflected in the bureaucratic power mechanisms (Foucault 2004) and underline how they favor the logic of the market to the whole of society and generalize an economic rationality to instruct and manage public action (Dardot and Laval, 2010).  
The analysis of the singular trajectories of neo-liberalization traced by these two federated entities when they seized new competencies highlights the transformation of the repertoires of public administration and public action in the sectors analyzed. The question that motivates us is therefore the following: how are the new policies put in place through the action of administrative vehicles in the process of formation and what are the knowledge networks mobilized to establish their political rationality? What are the interplays between the bureaucratic power mechanisms and the political orientations of the governments in the two regions for two policy sectors.",Université de Liège,,,,,,,,Université de Liège,,Catherine Fallon,,,,,,,,Catherine Fallon,,Governance,Public Administration,Regionalism,Qualitative Comparative Analysis,,,,,"Contrasting administrative capacities as forms of neoliberalism in the two main regions of Belgium, Flandre et en Wallonie",https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65952&EventID=185
0,"Against arguments made on Marxism as a Eurocentric and determinist theory and methodology that is unable to offer avenues for peoples from the Global South, there is increasing effort to shed light on the contributions made by these very peoples in developing Marxism in their own diverse contexts. From Latin America and the Caribbean to Asia and Africa, political theorization was and still is a strategic endeavor of national liberation from colonization and neocolonization, for envisioning emancipatory avenues towards decolonized futures. Addressing questions such as racism and racial subjugation, religion, culture, nation and nationalism, and self-determination, intellectuals, party cadres and social leaders have drawn on Marx and Engels’ own writings and widened the scope of the critique of colonialism as a regime working to expand capitalism world-wide, including in its imperialist stage, unveiling the pervasive effects of such a regime in contemporary societies. This paper engages with some of these works by outlining a synthesis of tactical and strategic analyses made by these thinkers as contributions to political theory.

0,"The past decades have seen a veritable explosion of public authorities – at the national, regional and international organization level – implementing Corporate Sustainability Policies (CSPs) in an effort to lead firms towards “profit with purpose”. As widespread coverage of COP26 in Glasgow underscored, there is an increasing expectation that public policies are capable of steering business towards sustainability. The logic being that CSPs, whether taking the form of binding legislation or voluntary guidelines, function as blueprints for firms to follow, and specifying practices by which firms must act (e.g., disclosure requirements). Despite increased public CSP activity, and expectation, there is a paucity of systematic research testing whether public policies have, so far, been effective in achieving their aim; studies tend to examine more proximate determinants of firm strategy, on one hand, and the making and diffusion of public policy, on the other. In this paper, we bring together the full transmission chain, from public policy to firm strategy, to offer a novel analysis of when, how and to what extent public CSPs affect firms’ own sustainability communications, reporting activities and business strategies. We do this by using novel methods in natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) to measure text-reuse: the extent to which text from public CSP documents (e.g., the UN Global Compact) gets copied into firms’ own communications, reports, and sustainability strategy documents. Our analysis draws on a novel database of nearly 1500 CSPs over a 60-year time period from around the globe and a stratified random sample of over 750 firms (the largest cap firms from each of six world regions as well as the world’s most “woke” firms). In addition to identifying which firms adopt which public CSP language the most, we assess when firms tend to copy more CSPs into their own sustainability documents. Our argument is that firms tend to copy more CSP language when they face pronounced and public reputational issues around their own negative environmental, governance and social impacts. We measure these reputational issues using firm-level RepRisk data (which monitors global media sources to flag firms’ ESG risks and violations that have specific reputational, compliance, and financial impacts for the firm) and then test our argument using statistical analyses. Our results show that firms, in no small measure, rush to upgrade their sustainability strategies and communications by coping existing public CSP guidelines when faced with public reputational crises.",Kings College London,Kings College London,,,,,,,Kings College London,,Adam Chalmers,Robyn Klingler-Vidra,,,,,,,Adam Chalmers,,Environmental Policy,Regulation,Business,Climate Change,Big Data,,,,"Copenhagen, Glasgow, Paris and beyond: do regulations affect firms’ sustainability strategies?",https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64423&EventID=185
0,"Among the former Soviet Republics, Estonia together with the other two Baltic countries is an example of successful democratic consolidation. Yet, the last decade in Estonian politics has been shaped by an anti-political-establishment surge on both sides of the political specturm, which brought a conservative-populist party into government and is set to launch a liberal-technocratic newcomer, Estonia 200, into parliament as one of the most popular parties. This anti-establishment challenge has not undermined democratic political competition but has in a sense rather strengthened it. The current paper traces how this upheaval has unfolded in Estonian political discourse through an analysis of the entire media and parliamentary discourse from 2007 to 2022. 

The parliamentary elections in 2011 resulted in a four-party parliament instead of the usual six and the right-liberal Reform Party, which had been a member of every coalition since 1999, established almost a quasi-hegemonic position – no government coalition was possible without its participation, and it was in a position to dictate the terms of all government policy. 

In parallel to this concentration of power, public discontent began to visibly accumulate. By the elections in 2015, two protest parties – a moderate conservate Estonian Free Party and a populist-conservative Estonian Conservative People’s Party (EKRE) had established themselves and entered parliament. The former failed to endure, while the latter managed to triple its support by the 2019 elections and was included in a government coalition, which lasted until the beginning of 2021. 

This surge of populism, in part, triggered a liberal-technocratic counter-reaction in the form of Estonia 200, an entirely new party that was established a year before the 2019 elections. Even though they failed to enter parliament in 2019, three years later Estonia 200 is competing with EKRE over the position of the most popular party.

The current paper will give an account of how this transformation manifested itself in Estonian political discourse both in media and in parliament from 2007 to 2022. For this end, first, an almost complete media corpus for that period has been collected, which contains all content of the three major daily newspapers as well as the public broadcasting company (~3.5 million articles). Second, all parliamentary transcripts have been collected for the same period. Together, these two corpora cover almost the entire public political discourse in the country over almost four electoral cycles (except for social media). 

The analysis will trace the emergence of and counter-reactions to populism using supervised (classification of sentiment and populist speech) and unsupervised (topic modelling using word embedding and transformer-based models) machine learning techniques. As such, it will provide a unique overview of how the emergence and normalisation of populism has transformed the public political discourse in Estonia in terms of the range of issues that stand out and the level of emotionality of political discourse, while the democratic functioning of the political system as a whole and the basic democratic institutions that uphold democracy have, at least until now, held in place.",University of Tartu,,,,,,,,University of Tartu,,Martin Mölder,,,,,,,,Martin Mölder,,Media,Parliaments,Populism,Quantitative,Big Data,,,,Coping with an Anti-Establishment Surge Across the Political Spectrum: the Case of Estonia,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65296&EventID=185
0,"Decarbonisation efforts are forcing rapid whole-systems transitions in carbon-intensive regions. Local economies built up around coal, oil and gas are experiencing systemic disruptions in employment, and also in related social relationships, identities and institutions. In the face of this disruption, actors are coping with change in different ways. The “coping strategies” pursued by different actors depend upon who they are, the capacities that they have available to them, and the context in which they are embedded. However, in these situations, identities, capacities and contexts are in flux. 
This contribution present findings from a global inventory cataloguing the coping strategies that actors undertake in response to decarbonisation efforts in carbon-intensive regions. Our analysis examines how decarbonisation is (re)shaping who is considered “elite” and how elite power is being exercised in ways that can either support or hinder overall decarbonisation. Coping strategies in the inventory are characterised according to who is doing the coping, how the action (or non-action) is targeted, and what is being pursued. 
In order to determine who is coping, we make use of Avelino and Wittmayer’s ((2016) Multi-actor Perspective to classify actors as individuals, organisations or sectors who can operate at different levels, using different business models. To identify how the action is targeted, we build upon Axsen and Kurani’s (2012) typology of intended benefits. This is a matrix of actions intended to benefit either private interests or the collective, and characterised as either functional (i.e. things people “do”) or symbolic (i.e. things people “say”). To account for the contribution to decarbonisation, strategies are further classified as “supporting” or “hindering” of decarbonisation efforts. To classify what is being pursued, we group outcomes into broad categories (e.g. social, political) based on Sovacool et al (2020). We also note whether strategies are intended to adapt to changing conditions, resist changes, or if they try to modify or transform conditions (O’Brien 2012), and the intended timescale of impact.
Results, still preliminary at this point, reveal that early in transitions, elites with national and supranational reach usually resist change and try to prolong investment in fossil fuels. As transitions progress, these policy and business elites tend to support strategies that perpetuate the structural conditions associated with status quo institutional and socioeconomic conditions, through adaptive strategies that replace or compensate for carbon-intensive activities with lower carbon industrial activity (e.g. renewables installations, retraining workers for other industrial sectors). However, there are some elite actors, mostly at supra- and subnational scales who support transformative strategies that are more disruptive, but that better address injustices associated with the transition process (e.g. the development of local government-owned renewables installations; the establishment of energy communities).
The connections we map across actors, will help enhance our understanding of how different actions are emerging, and the ways in which equitable, socially sustainable approaches to decarbonisation can be best supported.",University of Sussex,,,,,,,,University of Sussex,,Roberto Cantoni,,,,,,,,Roberto Cantoni,,Energy Policy,Policy-Making,Transitional justice,,,,,,Coping with decarbonisation: the impact of elite power constellations on social responses to low carbon transitions,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65045&EventID=185
0,"The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a steep decline in demand for infrastructure lending by countries currently struggling to cope with its economic effects. Instead, the past two years have seen a steep rise in demands for COVID-recovery lending. This has presented a significant challenge to the newly established Asia Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), which focuses exclusively on infrastructure lending. The new bank faced various struggles from its inception, including US contestation and hesitancy by European partners to join its membership, as well as significant competition due to institutional overlap with the World Bank and the Asia Development Bank. Only a few years after its establishment, the pandemic has made matters worse for the AIIB. With its project pipelines focusing mainly on infrastructure lending, the fall in demand for infrastructure borrowing was bad news for the AIIB. This paper examines the strategies employed by the AIIB and its leadership to adapt to
the COVID-19 pandemic. As the findings suggest, the AIIB consciously engaged in collaborative partnerships with the World Bank to rely on the latter's more extensive project pipelines. This gave the AIIB access to World Bank lending projects with various clients interested in COVID-recovery and extended its lending operations beyond the infrastructure sector. By partnering up with the World Bank, the AIIB not only ensured continuity in its project stream but has also been able to gain expertise in recovery-plan lending necessary for evolving its own project pipeline. Finally, as a young institution with less credibility than its competitors, the AIIB has managed to improve its legitimacy in the eyes of stakeholders and clients through its partnerships with the World Bank, which have effectively given it the ""legitimacy stamp"". These findings are especially relevant to the IR literature on institutional overlap and regime complexity, where these factors are often argued to result in competition
and rivalry amongst IOs that share policy domains. In contrast to that conventional wisdom, the analysis in this paper showcases how institutional overlap has been a driver for cooperation between the World Bank and the AIIB, providing them with the opportunity to achieve interorganizational synergy when it comes to COVID-recovery lending in the Asia-Pacific. The analysis relies mainly on original data from 20+ interviews with AIIB, World Bank, and state officials as well as experts in the field.",Maastricht Universiteit,,,,,,,,Maastricht Universiteit,,Giuseppe Zaccaria,,,,,,,,Giuseppe Zaccaria,,Asia,Governance,Institutions,Global,World Bank,,,,Coping with the pandemic together: How the AIIB adapted to the COVID-19 challenge by cooperating with the World Bank,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63387&EventID=185
0,"In 1998 MoveOn pioneered a new and powerful form of digitally-enabled, multi-issue, member-driven, rapid response, advocacy organization. This model quickly spread around the world as other progressive activists emulated it in Australia (GetUp!), Germany (Campact) and in over a dozen other countries. These digital advocacy organizations are all united around common progressive values, and have been influential actors in national elections, and in public debate on a range of issues from the Iraq War to free trade agreements. Here we ask: Have right-wing groups also sought to copy this new digital advocacy organization’ model? And if so, how successful have they been? Drawing on the existing literature we identify three potential accounts for why the right might, or might not emulate the left on-line: 1) supply and demand; 2) ideological differences; and 3) transnational diffusion networks. We then examine four right-wing ""copycat” organizations - Grassfire, Advance Australia, Patriot Petition, and CitizenGo. We find that all four organizations are rapid-response, multi-issue on-line campaigning organizations, however none appear to be fully-member driven in their funding or decision-making. Rather these organizations seem to favour hierarchical top-down decision-making, as this is more compatible with norms on the right. Overall, this paper illustrates how some elements of an organizational model may diffuse from the left to the right of the political spectrum, but not others.",Johns Hopkins University,Freie Universität Berlin,Freie Universität Berlin,,,,,,Freie Universität Berlin,,Nina Hall,Annett Heft,Michael Vaughan,,,,,,Michael Vaughan,,Civil Society,Contentious Politics,Cyber Politics,Interest Groups,Internet,,,,Copycats: Does the Right Emulate the Left's Digital Advocacy Organizations?,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63853&EventID=185
0,"The paper investigates the utilisation of the coronavirus crisis by the Eurosceptic leaders in Visegrad Group (VG) counties. Our main argument is that the pandemic crisis reshaped and reinforced the Eurosceptic narrative frames in the region in two ways. First, as part of the ongoing polycrisis, it has contributed to maintaining Euroscepticism as a major and mainstream political narrative on the European Union. Second, it has helped to find new policy areas enriching the Eurosceptic arguments and vocabulary, such as Schengen cooperation, where the local leaders are attacking the mainstream policies of the European Union, using, e.g. securitising rhetorical strategies or blaming to frame the COVID crisis in Eurosceptic tone.
The VG countries are not the only examples of similar Eurosceptic discursive treatment of pandemic crisis, yet they represent an excellent research sample for our analysis. The VG countries have reinforced Eurosceptic narratives in the course of the European polycrisis, finally yet importantly, due to illiberal leadership predominant in the region. Therefore, considering the path dependence established in the period of polycrisis, we could expect a more evident manifestation of the trends mentioned above.
The paper explores analyses and compares the Eurosceptic narratives at the peak of the coronavirus crisis 2020-2021. We will analyse different texts produced by the selected politicians, such as official press releases, interviews, statements, or other longer and more profound pieces of communication produced by them since March 2020 (outbreak of the crisis in the region) and fall 2021 (termination of the delta mutation wave in the region). We will analyse the documents through the lens of narrative analysis. We prefer the analysis of narratives over discourse analysis since the latter is more suited to assessing individual actors’ discursive practices. A study of narratives was selected because it emphasises understanding the content and the discourse priorities expressed by the political actors.
We focus on the main actors dealing with the pandemic crisis, which means the prime ministers of VG countries. Czechia, Hungary, Poland, and Slovakia are parliamentary democracies. It means that both executive treatment and political communication of pandemic crisis are vested in the governments’ hands.",Masaryk University,Masaryk University,,,,,,,Masaryk University,,Vit Hloušek,Pavla Hosnedlová,,,,,,,Pavla Hosnedlová,,Europe (Central and Eastern),Democracy,Political Leadership,Euroscepticism,Narratives,,,,Coronavirus as a source of Eurosceptic narratives: Evidence from Central Eastern Europe,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63700&EventID=185
0,"Foreign agencies have been more actively sharing the resource burden of global investigations. In December 2016, Brazilian firms agreed to pay a record-setting penalty of over $3.5 billion to resolve a bribery case involving American, Brazilian and Swiss authorities. While it is difficult to deny the success of anti-corruption efforts represented by national and global corruption investigations, it is at the same time easy to realize that when such investigations involve significant politicians, several interest groups engage in an advocacy work consisting on politicizing a technical and complex issue, involving not only the Executive, but also the Judiciary and Legislative Branches. What is the role of mainstream/social media, fake news, prosecutors, and judges in such politicization of corruption investigations, and how all these players can influence the electorate in contexts of institutional crises and change political landscapes? This paper addresses these issues in the countries involved in the Car Wash/Jet Wash/“Lava Jato” case based on investigations derived from the aforementioned agreement before the U.S. DOJ, the Office of the Attorney General of Switzerland – OAG, and the Brazilian Federal Public Prosecution Office – MPF (Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Guatemala, Mexico, Panama, Peru, and Venezuela) in a comparative exercise with the aim of contributing to policy and legal decisions that could prevent politicization from affecting the corruption investigations, and at least mitigate the effects of such politicization over other fundamental (democratic) institutions. Finally, 5 years after the agreement, it seems important to analyze the Brazilian Supreme Court (STF) decisions that have addressed the allegations that the Car Wash/Jet Wash/“Lava Jato” investigations were politicized. As the Car Wash did influence other investigations in Latin America, it is expected that case law analyses about the STF trade-offs between anti-corruption measures and due process of law can be a contribution to comparative legal policy-oriented literature.","University of Michigan, Ann Arbor",,,,,,,,"University of Michigan, Ann Arbor",,Denis Guimaraes,,,,,,,,Denis Guimaraes,,Latin America,Corruption,Judicialisation,Policy Change,Policy Implementation,,,,"Corruption Investigations, Politicization, and Institutional Crises?

0,"Powerful alliances for social change become more urgent in times of multiple crises. Currently, authoritarian, patriarchal, racist, classist, and (hetero-)sexist patterns continue to gain momentum. However, in a world of intersectional oppression, it remains difficult to forge alliances demanding common demands and collective actions. It becomes even more difficult when we consider the different positions of power and domination from where we articulate and practice resistance. These (im)possibilities of intersectional alliances are still widely discussed in critical gender studies, black, and (queer-) feminist theory. 
The paper, thus, focuses on everyday life experience in which alliances can be forged. It does so through the lenses of hegemony theory to bring a currently underrated tool of critical analysis back into the discussion on intersectionality. Following feminist political scientist Brigitte Bargetz (2016), I argue that everyday life has an ambivalent role in the struggle for intersectional alliances. On the one hand, everyday life solidifies domination and, therefore, prevents intersectional alliances that emphasize interconnectedness and commonality in oppression. On the other hand, everyday life also provides possibilities for emancipatory resistance. However, does everyday life enable intersectional alliances? I will show in my paper that the answer depends on the way stories and the positions from where they are told in everyday life. With Antonio Gramsci (2012) and the feminist re-readings of Gundula Ludwig (2011), I understand stories as Common Sense [ital. Senso Comune] because they tell us what is normal, and thus without alternative, in certain societies at certain times and about which social consensus prevails. 
Common Sense represents a powerful instrument in the struggle of societal forces, which makes collective action (im)possible on an everyday basis: I will argue in a first step, that Common Sense as a ""single story"" (Adichie 2009) of consent to hegemonic positions, and privileges, makes intersectional alliances (almost) impossible. I will argue in a second step, that, contrastingly, Common Sense can offer the potential to enable fertile ground for intersectional alliances under certain conditions. I refer here to Gramsci's philosophy of praxis and feminist re-readings of counterhegemonic Common Sense (cf. Sara Ahmed 2021) to show that there are a lot of stories in the counter-archive telling of intersectionality. Therefore, stories do not only stabilize hegemony but can tell different stories, stories of difference that can be told from manifold positions.",Westfälische Wilhelms-Universität Münster,,,,,,,,Westfälische Wilhelms-Universität Münster,,Henrike Bloemen,,,,,,,,Henrike Bloemen,,Gender,Political Theory,Knowledge,Feminism,Narratives,Power,,,Counterhegemonic Storytelling: The Ambivalence of Common Sense in Intersectional Alliances,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64686&EventID=185
0,"Court-executive relations have been conflictive in many Latin American countries in the last decades. The independence of highest courts is frequently contested through formal and informal political interferences when courts take decisions contrary to government interests. 
 
During the pandemic, executives have been implementing protection measures against the spread of the virus that curtailed individual rights or that resulted in conflicts of competences between different levels of government. For example, court-executive relations in Brazil and El Salvador, where populist presidents Bolsonaro and Bukele reacted with public attacks to rulings from the highest courts, drew a lot of attention. In Brazil, the Supremo Tribunal Federal (STF) maintained its power to control a hostile executive unwilling to implement the necessary measures to fight the pandemic. On the contrary, in El Salvador, the conflict between the executive and the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court increased during the pandemic and, lastly, ended with the destitution of four judges.  
 
This paper starts with an overview of the court-executive relations among the region in the last decade. Then, it undertakes the first regional mapping of these relations during the pandemic, on pandemic-related court decisions and the respective government reactions. We discuss exemplary cases of court interventions in three areas: the protection of individual rights, the control of executive decrees on emergency measures and the arbitration of conflicts between different levels of government. Two case studies on Brazil and El Salvador explore in more detail whether and how court-executive relations evolved under these exceptional circumstances, and which have been the effects on the democratic regimes.",German Institute for Global And Area Studies,German Institute for Global And Area Studies,,,,,,,German Institute for Global And Area Studies,,Mariana Llanos,Cordula Tibi Weber,,,,,,,Cordula Tibi Weber,,Comparative Politics,Democracy,Executives,Latin America,Courts,,,,Court-Executive Relations under the Pandemic,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63866&EventID=185
0,"In recent years, many countries experienced an increased support for far-right populists whose ideology clashes with central tenets of liberal democracy. As part of these developments, counter-majoritarian institutions such as high courts and independent judiciaries have come under intense pressure from populist actors who regard them as illegitimate restrictions on the presumed will of the people. Where populists entered governments, e.g. in Hungary or Poland, populist attacks paved the way for institutional reforms that led to a systematic erosion of judicial independence. The literature has acknowledged the threat posed by these trends and explained how and why populist rebuild the institutional order once in power; however, scholars have so far largely neglected to analyse the relationship between populism and courts in cases where populist parties are in opposition or lack the necessary majorities for sweeping reforms. This paper proposes a more holistic engagement with populist attacks on high courts. We argue that populists engage in different strategies depending on their strength and governing status. In particular, we focus on strategies of delegitimization directed against court decisions, judges and the concept of judicial review that are employed when populist parties are not in a position to effect institutional change. Thereby, populists in opposition particularly benefit from the rise and use of social media, allowing them to circumvent the gate-keeping role of traditional journalism. We illustrate our arguments using empirical evidence from tweets of politicians from Germany, the Netherlands, Poland and the United Kingdom.",Universität Hannover,Universität Hannover,Universität Hannover,Universität Hannover,Universität Hannover,,,,Universität Hannover,,Christoph Hönnige,Merle Huber,Merle Huber,Philipp Koeker,Dominic Nyhuis,,,,Philipp Koeker,,Democracy,Populism,Courts,Social Media,,,,,Courts under pressure: How populists seek to delegitimize independent judiciaries using social media,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64145&EventID=185
0,"This paper starts with an analysis of the healthcare policy process in the context of the different COVID 19 waves in France. It can be characterized by the key role of presidential authority, especially during the first wave. The main decisions were taken by the Sanitary Defence Council directly headed by Emmanuel Macron and announced by him. The President also launched a scientific council directly working for the Executive. This centralization of the decision process, reinforcing the presidentialization of the French political system, has led to a strong politicization of the COVID 19 policy issues and to a bypassing of the programmatic group: the “welfare elite”, a narrow group of senior civil servants, characterized by a specialized career path in the Social Security administration, which holds a key position in the healthcare policy process since the end of the 20th century (Genieys, Hassenteufel, 2015). Their policy change program has been heavily contested in the context of the COVID 19 pandemic, especially in the hospital sector with the lack of intensive care beds shedding the light on the negative effects of strict budgetary constraint on healthcare provision. The organization of a large discussion forum with the main stakeholders in June 2020 (“Ségur de la Santé”) has led to the adoption of different policy measures: the reopening of hospitals beds, recruitment of healthcare workers and medical staff, wage increase hospitals (especially for nurses) and the weakening of managerial power in hospitals (Hassenteufel, 2020). Therefore the COVID 19 pandemic seems to play the role of a focusing event (Kingdon 1984, Birkland, 1997), punctuating the established policy equilibrium (Baumgartner, Jones, 1993) in French healthcare policies. The paper will discuss this interpretation by shedding the light on previous changes in these policies, especially the elaboration of a new policy program oriented towards the reorganization of healthcare provision based on territorialization and new modes of coordination. It is strongly related to the agenda setting of the issue of “medical deserts” (Hassenteufel et al., 2020), and the growing involvement of elected local authorities in healthcare issues, reinforced by the COVID 19 crisis. The paper analyzes the policy actors involved in the shaping of this policy change program which are related to the “welfare elite” and how they try to make a strategic use of the current crisis in order to push it forward, in new institutions created before the crises, especially the regional health (state) agencies (ARS). Finally, we stress that the French programmatic elite in healthcare policies has been able to maintain its position in the policy process, especially in policy implementation, in the context of the COVID 19 crisis and therefore to pursue the new reform path initiated before.",The University Paris-Saclay Graduate School for Sociology and Political Science,,,,,,,,The University Paris-Saclay Graduate School for Sociology and Political Science,,Patrick Hassenteufel,,,,,,,,Patrick Hassenteufel,,Elites,Executives,Interest Groups,Local Government,Policy Analysis,Public Policy,Welfare State,Policy-Making,COVID 19 and the healthcare policy process in France: between presidentialization and programmatic reform path,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65777&EventID=185

For the covid-19 increasing the global poverty rate from 7.8 to 9.1 percent; 163 million more are living on less than $5.50 a day (World bank 2021). Poorer countries are contending with a deeper, longer-lasting crisis that has increased global poverty and is reversing recent trends of shrinking inequality. It is not possible to quantify the effect on global inequality yet, but simulations suggest that an increase of just 1% in within-country inequality would result in 32 million people living on less than $1.90 a day in 2021 and increase the gap between the income growth of the bottom and top 40 percent to 4 percent from 2.7 percent with no change in within-country inequality. Those who lost income due to the pandemic have been almost twice as likely to spend down assets or savings, leaving them less able to cope with continued or recurrent income losses. They have also been 57 percent more likely to go a full day without eating, which carries serious long-term consequences for cognitive and physical development when experienced among children. It is also estimated that covid-19 could lead to an aggregate loss of between 0.3 and 0.9 years of schooling, with poorer families the most impacted. Corona virus made their life more difficult.

0,"As Covid-19 hit Syria after a decade of protracted conflict, the fragmentation of the territory and governance system prevented the adoption of a national strategy to mitigate the impact of the pandemic. In Idlib governorate, Covid-19 highlighted the inability of the Syrian Salvation government to offer effective alternatives to the Syrian regime. While it failed to provide healthcare and social services and to corner the international aid market, international aid routes were blocked by al-Assad’s regime in an attempt to squeeze the opposition further. In this context, local civil society in northwest Syria emerged as another non-state agent of governance – with a focus on providing healthcare and social services – in Idlib. Based on 73 in-depth interviews conducted between June 2020 and April 2021 across Idlib governorate, this article exposes and interrogates the tensions in the political and humanitarian space between restrictions – in the case of the international community and opposition government – and transformation – namely that of local civil society.",University of Edinburgh,,,,,,,,University of Edinburgh,,Juline Beaujouan,,,,,,,,Juline Beaujouan,,Civil Society,Conflict,Governance,,,,,,"Covid-19 and Alternative Governance Systems of in Idlib, Syria",https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63090&EventID=185

This measure, however, sounds rather sneaky in those regimes characterised by a vacillating rule of law and facing socio-political grievances during a revolution or after the fall of a decade-long authoritarian regime. This article sheds light on two case studies, Tunisia and Algeria, which have been hit very hard by the pandemic in the last two years and have witnessed increasing restrictions on civil liberties in times of profound political changes.  Based on semi-structured interviews with civil society activists mobilising in the two different countries and the document analysis of national authorities’ securitization strategies, this article focuses on the following research questions: How has the pandemic transformed the political opportunities of civil society and social movements in two countries characterised by a revolutionary process - the Hirak movement in Algeria and a bumpy democratization process in Tunisia? In other words, how have power relations between national authorities and their internal opponents changed in two countries classified as a faltering democracy (Tunisia) and a hybrid regime (Algeria) after the outbreak of the pandemic? More broadly speaking, how the reconfiguration of power relations given by the pandemic, including the countries turning in on themselves, has affected the state of democratisation in the two countries? By answering these questions, this article sits at the intersection of the literature on contentious politics and democratization studies.

The politicisation of fear as a strategy in pursuit of radical-right agendas, with the objectiveof retaining political power at all costs, is examined at length. Ruthless exploitation of fear of the unknown by Trump and his close aides and leading supporters led to blaming, demonisation, and scapegoatingof 'the other,' whether foreign nations, foreigners, scientists, and medical experts holding evidence-based positions that contradicted radical-right emotional or political opinions, or indeed anyone daring to challenge radical-right assertions or their numerous conspiracytheories. The chapter addresses how, in an attempt to hijack national virtues, radical-right populists sought to strengthen their identity through 'othering,' juxtaposing themselves with 'the other,'and projecting themselves as sole paragons of conservatism, patriotism, and protecting democracy.

It will focus on the following questions: what is it that make citizens (ir)responsible during a life-threatening pandemic? Is it their ability to conform to governmental rules? Or is it their ability not to lose their critical capacity to challenge, contest and question governmental decisions? Focusing on the Italian context, I suggest that, despite the mobility restrictions, the government retained overall its liberal rationality and people too used all the available gaps in the system in order to evade immobility rules. While everyday practices of evasion did not fundamentally transform the citizens into irresponsible citizens, many acts of resistance and protests did. Building upon the work of Jacques Derrida, the paper will suggest that response-ability is above all the ability to respond beyond the law and dominant rules. Any act involves both responsibility and irresponsibility, that is the responsibility toward some and irresponsibility toward others.

0,"The modus operandi of social movements is tremendously affected by times of crisis, as social movements reflect the atmosphere of the society and the time they are in. Although ""crisis"" is not a new concept for studying social movements, the COVID-19 pandemic crisis had significant repercussions for all social movements. Despite authoritarian governments’ attempts to control cyberspace during this time, the internet has been an important source of information for citizens in times of need for many years. This study aims to understand of how social movements adapt to the pandemic challenges in societies where there was already an oppressive government? 
This study is a single case in-depth review of the Fridays for Future movement in Turkey. Turkey's FFF movement is a typical case, as it is a representative of a social movement under (competitive) authoritarian regimes, and it is a relevant case because it is a young, emerging movement in an authoritarian context. With a qualitative approach, this study conducts a descriptive analysis rather than using a classical hypothesis testing approach, given that the literature on the COVID-19 pandemic is relatively new and does not have a solid theoretical background yet.  Semi-structured interviews with activists who are actively taking part in the FFF movement on the local and national levels yielded the following findings. 
While the movement is still struggling to adapt to the new challenges that came into existence with the pandemic such as communication problems, losing visibility, and lack of motivation, the activists pointed out that they actively respond to these new challenges by tactical innovation. In such times, employing a hybrid strategy of on- and offline protests allowed the movement to ensure its presence in the public sphere. They were able to get a wider audience's attention by preparing webinars and panels. Hence, despite all the difficulties they have faced, they managed to stay active in this period and planned some offline activities. The adaptation period to the new normal under the pandemic conditions for the FFF movement was long, due mainly to communication problems and lack of motivation. Pandemic-related grievances made the activists realize that the arbitrary practices of the government are only applicable in the public spaces. In the online sphere, they have ""freedom from the government's control"".

0,"The present study focuses on the period of the COVID-19 pandemic in Greece, Romania and Servia, from the detection of the first case of COVID-19 to the first week of 2022. In this study, a combination of multivariate data analysis methods was employed to analyze COVID-19-related data so as assess the quality of decision-making outputs during the crisis and improve evidence-based decision-making processes. 
For the study purposes, data were obtained from the Oxford Covid-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT) and were combined with self-collected Covid-19 data and official data from ECDC. The Oxford Covid-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT) collects publicly available information reflecting government response from 180 countries since 1 January 2020. The tracker is based on data for 23 indicators.
In this study, two groups of indicators were considered: Containment & Closure and Health Systems. The first group of indicators refers to COVID-19: analysis of government’s preventing measures and health data records “collective” level policies and measures, such as school closures and restriction in mobility, while the second refers to “individual” level policies and measures, such as testing and vaccination. All collective-level indicators (C1 to C8) were summed to yield a total score (ranging from 0 to 16). Similarly, individual-level indicators (H1 to H3 and H6 to H8) were summed to compute a total score (ranging from to 12).
The data about COVID indices refer to positive cases, number of Covid-19-related deaths, number of tests and total number of vaccinations administered. These data have been recorded daily since March 2020 from public announcements by official and verified sources. Three quantitative indicators were derived, a positivity index (#cases / #tests), a mortality index (#deaths / #cases) and a testing index (#tests / #people). The final data set consisted of five indicators: two ordinal total scores, and three quantitative indices.
Based on the study results, we can argue that, when it comes to measures and real time data following a situation such as the pandemic, “the chicken and egg” dilemma arises. The question is whether “collective” and “individual” measures affect daily incidence data or the inverse (i.e., that the daily data lead to measures).
We conclude that in fact the two should be perceived as working in conjunction and not independently from one another. The analysis showed that lower positivity rate is accompanied by average levels of measures from the government at both the “individual” and the “collective” level. Furthermore, higher positivity rate is accompanied by higher levels of measures, as a response. With regard to mortality rate, we observed that higher mortality invokes higher levels of “collective” measures and average levels of “individual” measures, whereas average levels of “collective” measures are associated with higher mortality rate.

It is therefore evident that when it comes to decision making in crisis situations, a systematic collection, analysis and use of data is linked to more effective government response overall. Therefore, evidence-based policy making should be linked to crisis management.",Aristotle University of Thessaloniki,,,,,,,,Aristotle University of Thessaloniki,,Theodore Chadjipadelis,,,,,,,,Theodore Chadjipadelis,,Methods,Quantitative,Policy Implementation,Policy-Making,,,,,COVID-19 Pandemic: a methodological model for the analysis of government’s preventing measures and health data records,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63821&EventID=185
0,"The year 2021 has seen an ideological radicalization of Covid protests in Germany. Additionally, violent clashes between protesters and police as well as attacks on journalists are repeatedly reported. Many of the Anti-Covid protesters portray the existing political system as a “Covid dictatorship” and conspiracy beliefs are abundant. Moreover, there are frequent reports of violent attacks on vaccination centers, as well as reports of politicians, scientists, journalists, and doctors being verbally threatened. These events point towards a potential threat of radicalized Covid-19 skeptics to democracy. 

Whereas a vast amount of studies has looked into the origins of Covid-19 conspiracy belief as well as its consequences for health behaviour and vaccine intentions, the links between  Covid-19 conspiracy beliefs as well as Covid-19 skepticism and support for democracy remain a blank space. In general, the effect of conspiracy belief on support for democracy appears to be an underresearched topic (see Pantazi et al. 2021; Albertson & Guiler 2020 for exceptions). Existing studies thus far focussed on the effects of conspiracy beliefs on political participation (e.g., Jolley & Douglas 2014) as well as violent political actions (Vegetti & Littvay 2021; Lamberty & Leiser 2021).
 
In this paper we examine the link between support for alternative models of democracy (direct democracy and technocracy) and Covid-19 skepticism (i.e. the belief that the coronavirus is not dangerous) as well as Covid-19 related conspiracy beliefs. 

The paper uses a representative sample of 1,100 individuals surveyed in the East German state of Thuringia in Summer 2021. We show that Covid-19 skepticism is linked to increased support for direct democracy as well as technocracy. There is (weaker) evidence for the belief in Covid-19 conspiracy theories that points towards the same direction. 

This contradicts claims that conspiracy belief is associated with decreased support for democracy, as well as that Covid-19 skeptics are per se anti-democratic. Instead, our findings suggest that Covid-19 skepticism and  conspiracy beliefs are associated with a preference for direct (i.e. more participatory) as well as technocratic (i.e. more effective) models of democracy over representative democracy.",Friedrich-Schiller Universität Jena,Friedrich-Schiller Universität Jena,Friedrich-Schiller Universität Jena,,,,,,Friedrich-Schiller Universität Jena,,Anne Küppers,Anne Küppers,Marion Reiser,,,,,,Anne Küppers,,Democracy,Extremism,Quantitative,Regression,Empirical,,,,Covid-19 skepticism and conspiracy belief and the support for (alternative models of) democracy,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63284&EventID=185

The extent to which it has changed the global landscape will be seen in years to come, however, we already start to see how norms of global governance are being challenged. How we manage health pandemics in a ‘smaller world’ and how we coordinate between multiple actors and institutions raises significant questions concerning not only the instruments but the very rationality of global governance.

Yet how we govern in a world of complexity and what role is given to resilience in relating human behaviour to complex systems should now be under critical scrutiny.

While most research confirms that populist radical right-wing parties – and their voters – typically take covid-skeptical positions, and they are less trustful of vaccines (see for example Italy, Brazil, US), and more critical of lockdowns. Some populist radical right-wing parties on government (e.g. in Poland and Hungary), as well as their take more nuanced positions on the issue, combining (silent) covid-skepticism with an authoritarian push on the vaccines (and sometimes on lockdowns) and the overpoliticization of the vaccine issue that deepens existing divisions.

0,"Both political practice and academic discourse assume that the local level has the potential to strengthen cohesion in the European Union. Recent crises like the Euro crisis, the so-called ‘refugee crisis’ and the Covid 19-pandemic have fueled these discussions about economic and social cohesion, problematizing polarization and increasing structural imbalances within the EU. At the same time, these crises have also contributed to strengthening Eurosceptic sentiments among the citizens. Due to its closeness to citizens and the concrete implementation of European policies, the local level is considered a starting point for tackling these problems and strengthening cohesion. Anyhow, this thesis has so far not been reviewed systematically on a broader scale.
We argue that the strengthening of cohesion depends on agency, both of local administrations and politics and local (organized) civil society. How local actors engage with European issues and communicate about these locally may have an impact on the expression of local cohesion, understood as citizens’ relationships with the polity (vertical) and each other (horizontal). The paper investigates this expectation empirically, focusing on two directions. First, it looks into which societal actors are part of Europe-related networks and how they are integrated into the political process. Given that the local level enjoys no formal status in the European policy-making process beyond the advisory Committee of Regions and constitutional guarantees of subsidiarity, we expect to find different manifestations of local networks, priorities and cooperation models. The aim is to bring our empirical findings in this context into order as a first step on the way to typologize Europe-related local networks. Second, the paper investigates local administrations’ ideas about how to address local society, and whom they consider their primary audience. This second direction, therefore, focuses on discourse and ideas of the role of civil society in Europe-related issues.
The paper presents fresh empirical data from a current research project. It includes findings from a survey of all German municipalities with at least 20.000 inhabitants about their Europe-related action. Furthermore, it draws on case studies in eight German cities (four medium-sized and four big cities) consisting of expert interviews with local actors and documents’ analyses. By combining the different types of empirical material, the paper develops a multi-faceted view of local actors’ Europe-related networking activities, focusing on their interaction with the citizens and among each other and stressing their ideas about their respective role for European cohesion.

0,"Rising public approval and electoral gains for radical right parties and populist movements contest liberal democracies all over Europe. By positioning themselves as law and order parties together with a pronounced framing of the migration crisis in terms of security threats, radical right parties aim to obtain issue ownership on immigration and link it with crime. The strategic use of agenda setting and priming to combine these issues is main part of the electoral strategy of populist radical right parties. On the empirical side, the findings are mixed and scarce. Neither the effect immigration, nor the effect of crime on the electoral success of radical right parties is uncontested. Potential sources for the inconclusiveness of these findings are differences in scale and level of aggregation, heterogeneous operationalization of the theoretical constructs, and the complex interaction between the variables at play.
Our contribution connects to this research puzzle. We ask, whether and how crime has an influence on the success of populist radical right parties and how this effect is moderated by the local presence of immigrants. Based on previous research, we assume that immigration evokes a perceived threat within parts of the electorate, which leads to increased vote proportions of populist radical right parties.
We extend the state research as we study the proposed effects on the local level at several elections at three levels of the political system over seven years: national, state, and local elections in the state of Baden-Württemberg, Germany. As official crime statistics in Germany are published only on the district level, we make use of a corpus of over 500.000 police press reports published since 2015 by police departments in the state of Baden-Wuerttemberg, Germany. To be able to match the crime reports with the electoral results on municipal level, first, the documents are geolocated. In a second step, human coders annotate a sample of the corpus for text classification. The labeled data are then used for supervised machine learning to classify the documents regarding relevant crimes. The crimes that are identified by the classified documents are aggregated on the level of municipal administrative units. With this measure of crime prevalence on the local level, we are able to test the local influence of reported crime on the local vote shares of populist radical right parties and its interaction with immigration. As controls, we account for potential confounders like urbanization and, wealth. Preliminary results reveal heterogeneous relationship between reported crime and votes for radical right parties.

Pressures from the public to quickly and decisively solve problems, albeit with widely differing preferred solutions, collide with institutional logics of decision-making, formal mandates and technocratic culture within EU institutions. Located at the intersection between the outcries in the public sphere and the internal logics within EU institutions, public relations officials working at EU institutions are ideally placed to interpret how the EU deals with crises in terms of communication and to what extent crises are internalized by key decision-makers within the EU.

0,"The paper investigates the specificity of regional leadership in political system of Russia. The regional elite in Russia is one of the most important components of the stability of the political system. Due to the peculiarities of the federal structure of the Russian Federation (also including the scale of the territory), the regional leader is one of the key links in the successful implementation of socio-political and economic reforms in the regions.

From 1991 to the present day, the role of the regional leader in the system of power relations has changed. Heads of administrations (governors) have gone from popularly elected leaders to controlled functionaries. In fact, this was facilitated by a number of institutional changes and political reforms undertaken over the past 30 years.

Today regional leaders and current governors have found themselves in a rather complex system of inter-institutional relations. In some regions the situation is aggravated by the presence of a patron-client system of relations and corruption ties, as evidenced by a number of corruption scandals and criminal cases. On the one hand, leaders of regional elite must effectively solve the economic problems facing the region, ensure the implementation of federal programs, sometimes with substantially reduced funding, to participate in elections and be guided by the opinion of voters, but at the same time, the elite must show complete loyalty to the Center and should not exceed the permitted limits. The president has the right to send the governor to resign, moreover the region can enter the sphere of interests of large holdings and corporations and in this case the governor has no mechanisms of counteraction. In local conditions, it is often impossible to fulfill social obligations and execute federal projects.

The ruling élite functioned as an echelon of support for one of the first personages of political establishment, which predetermined the clan character of the relations, striving for isolation, negative expectations concerning recruiting new politicians, who were regarded in the first place as rivals in the struggle for the influence of their patron. The artificial barriers hinder the emergence of new promising persons in the political arena and, in fact, do not solve any of the existing problems. Possible strong candidates do not want to get involved in the elections. As a result, the specific type of the regional leader - “faceless-leader” was formed 

Such a situation provokes a crisis in the political system of the region, which in the end leads to the development of corruption ties in the power echelons and as a result of the adoption of inefficient decisions, the reduction of the professional level of management personnel. The results of the recent elections in a number of regions showed a critical level of people's trust in the ruling political elite, which was reflected in low turnout and high degree of absenteeism especially among the young people.

0,"This presentation inquires to what extent intersectionality can contribute to subject-oriented research on racism, while providing insight into the findings of a recently completed PhD project. 
In two empirical studies, subjective conceptions of racism were analysed from the perspective of 110 student teachers at the University of Vienna. These conceptions are both the starting point and the outcome for learning processes (Autor_innengruppe Fachdidaktik, 2017, p. 65). The ideas analysed in the empirical studies were linked to form supra-individual basic thematic patterns. Empirically justified, theoretically reflected, and professionally theoretically connectable subject didactic impulses were elaborated in order to develop new spaces of possibility. Furthermore, target group-specific learning opportunities for a subject-oriented and citizenship education in context of critical race theory were developed as a contribution to the didactically motivated research on ideas in the field of teacher education. The examination of an understanding that is initially critical race theory can provide a (conceptual) set of tools for the analysis of political, social and cultural conditions (Linnemann/Mecheril/Nikolenko, 2013, p. 11).  Finally, the subject-oriented perspective understands here research starting from the standpoint of the subject while simultaneously taking into account the social conditions as they manifest themselves mediated as meanings in the lifeworld of the subject (Scharathow, 2010, p. 100). Subjective conceptions are negotiated here as a form of representation of the learner's perspective in terms of their interweavings with the (hegemonic) structural contexts and norms in which they are embedded. Thus, it is also about the interactions between subjective experience, interpretation, action and objective relations (ebd., p. 103). In particular, inclusive and intersectional contexts are to be negotiated here.",University of Vienna,,,,,,,,University of Vienna,,Lara Möller,,,,,,,,Lara Möller,,Citizenship,Analytic,Race,Education,,,,,Critical race theory and subject orientation in Citizenship Education.

0,"This paper charts the potential of critical theories to inform defenses of democracy. To do so, it
reconstructs Theodor Adorno and Max Horkheimer’s politics of knowledge in post-war Germany. It
demonstrates that their efforts suggest a potential alternative strategy to extant models of
democratic defense. These efforts include, among others, Adorno’s proposals for democratic
education and Horkheimer’s engagement in re-establishing empirical sociology in Germany, both of
which were meant to foster a democratic culture. They indicate a development away from
theoretical self-certainty and towards the analysis of historically specific democratic knowledge.
This provides clues to how critical theories might contribute to the defense of democracy today.
Rather than insisting on received theoretical positions, critical theories ought to engage in analyses
that excavate knowledge structures which are conducive to a democratic culture. By recovering
early Critical Theory’s post-war approach to democratic defense, the paper thus (1) opens pathways
for retheorizing democratic defense and (2) enables a rethinking of critical theory’s relationship to
democratic politics today.",Lunds Universitet,,,,,,,,Lunds Universitet,,Patrick Nitzschner,,,,,,,,Patrick Nitzschner,,Democracy,Political Theory,Critical Theory,,,,,,"Critical theory, democratic defense, and the politics of knowledge",https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65130&EventID=185

Alongside the 2012 remote enfranchisement, it brought together a unique form of diaspora mobilization by/for Turkish parties (AKP and CHP), as well as diaspora organizations’ mobilization for Turkish parties (HDP). Religious diaspora-based associations and their interests in supporting homeland parties are still understudied.

Yet violence against children remains highly disproportionally distributed, with developed countries showing less support for violence compared to their developed counterparts. Building on Ingelhart’s typology of secular-traditional and postmodern values, this study examines the role of culture in explaining violence against children in six South Asian (Bangladesh, India, and Pakistan) and European (Germany, Belgium, and Sweden) nations. Empirical evidence provides mixed support to the theoretical demonstrations that the beholders of secular and postmaterial values would denounce violence against children, and this relationship would be more pronounced in European than South Asian contexts. This study found that as almost equal proportions of South Asians support violence against children, such support is fairly low in European countries. Further analyses within the two societies showed that the spillover effects of secular values orientations are more complicated than they appear at the face; nevertheless, the effect of postmodern values are in expected directions.",Universitetet i Bergen,,,,,,,,Universitetet i Bergen,,Bilal Hassan,,,,,,,,Bilal Hassan,,Developing World Politics,Comparative Perspective,Public Opinion,Political Cultures,,,,,Culture and Public Support for Violence Against Children in Six Nations of South Asia and Europe,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65442&EventID=185
0,"Research suggests that social polarisation and party preferences can reinforce ideological distinctions in society along cultural
issues such as abortion, gay rights, and climate change. This polarisation, based on social identities and existing social
cleavages, is gradually absorbed by partisanship and has become the primary cleavage dividing citizens to a greater extent
than other salient issues. For example, why do many voters for far-right parties also embrace climate change skepticism,
opposition to homosexual marriage, and anti-vaccine movements? A synoptic answer to this question is related to the
politicisation of cultural social identities that are increasingly aligned with a partisan identity to a degree that they divide the
new left and far-right voters. In our article, we argue that societal conflicts around cultural issues, such as the ones described
above, can create group identities and affective polarisation that is as intense as that of partisanship. To test our hypotheses,
we use a novel dataset of more than 1 million people. The dataset combines over six comparative and longitudinal studies
(i.e., EVS, Eurobarometer, CSES) covering countries as diverse as Albania, Poland, the Netherlands, and the UK between the
early 1980s until 2019. By employing multilevel structural equation modeling we identify cross-country trends in affective
polarisation, and we link those trends to latent constructs representing culture wars. Our study emphasizes the need to
account for the impact of culture wars on affective polarisation.",University of Surrey,,,,,,,,University of Surrey,,Roula Nezi,,,,,,,,Roula Nezi,,Cleavages,Comparative Politics,Electoral Behaviour,Public Opinion,Voting Behaviour,Political Cultures,,,Culture wars?

0,"Political animosity appears to be widespread in today’s democracies and in the online public sphere, where citizens not only tend to disagree and discuss vehemently but also display intolerance towards the people they disagree with (Gervais, 2015; Lee et al. 2019). Ideological conflicts lie at the heart of this: the perception that the opponent’s values and beliefs are incompatible with and a threat to one’s own fosters social and political intolerance (Brandt et al. 2014). As a result, citizens with extreme ideological stances are more likely to be hostile towards opponents (Helbling and Jungkunz 2020; Lelkes, 2019). While social as well as political intolerance in the US political landscape is shown to be driven by ideological extremity, the origins of such political animosity in a digital communication ecology are less clear, and even less so in non-US contexts (Wagner, 2021; Reiljan, 2019). In this study we argue that the extent to which the opponents’ worldview is perceived as threatening is dependent upon the online information environment individuals create for themselves, specifically via acts of news curation.  

One major asset that is believed to prevent growing intolerance and distance in society is the free flow of political arguments (Jenkins and Thorburn 2004; Sullivan et al. 1982). Being confronted with opposing views will help citizens see and understand ‘the other side’ or even prevent the establishments of oppositional camps in society. On more and more platforms, however, active and passive selection mechanisms determine the information users see. Hence, we test a potential mechanism where the limiting or boosting of one’s exposure to diverse sets of political information via news curation practices on algorithmic platforms is related to political animosity. Specifically, we study whether four types of news curators (tech avoiders; news omnivores; news limiters; and news boosters) differ in strength and direction of the relationship between ideological extremity and political animosity.  

Drawing on a sample of 1,663 adults in the Netherlands, our findings suggest that while ideological extremity predicts both social and political intolerance, it does not predict a higher use of personal news curation practices. In line with our expectations, the relationship between ideological extremity and both types of political animosity is conditional on the type of news curation practices. The more users with more extreme standpoints confine the news diet to their needs while only receiving little political information on algorithmic platforms, the less intolerant are they. This means, a curated news diet, even for citizens with extreme viewpoints, is not necessarily positively related to social and political intolerance. It only is when algorithmic news use is high. As such, our findings suggest that a high algorithmic news intake supports a possible reinforcing spiral between extremity and intolerance, while a lower intake, especially if it is highly curated, seems to decrease the chances of setting a reinforcing spiral in motion.",Freie Universität Berlin,,,,,,,,Freie Universität Berlin,,Jakob Ohme,,,,,,,,Jakob Ohme,,Political Violence,Social Media,Communication,Political Ideology,,,,,Curating political animosity?

0,"Cyberspace has evolved into a key arena and focal point of international affairs. Most state actors have thus used cyber diplomacy to advocate cyber security techniques in response to attacks that frequently target national key infrastructures and risk political regime stability. While some states advocate for the contentious new active cyber defense approach, others continue to rely on the current passive cyber defense norm. Previous contributions have identified technical, legal, and political elements impacting state decision-making. No prior research, however, has provided normative explanations for their cyber security proclivities. Using the norm life cycle theory, this study aims to explain why Romania employs passive cyber defense. Empirical evidence from one military and two civilian institutions – National Center CYBERINT, National Cyber Security Directorate, and The Romanian Association for Information Security Assurance – as well as the content of Romania's National Cyber Security Strategy 2.0 show that, in terms of cyber diplomacy, Romania promotes itself internally and externally as endorsing the passive cyber defense approach.

0,"In this article, I examine Cyprus as the archetypical ‘capitalist commodity frontier,’ first under the Lusignan, and second under the Venetian rule. I explain the Cypriot sugar (1299-1473) and cotton (1473-1573) booms and busts through the formation of socio-ecological relations central to the rise of world-capitalism. Historically-specific forms of science, technology, governmentality, and aqua-territoriality conditioned novel, cyclical, and cumulative patterns of organizing labor and nature. In turn, these patterns created new set of opportunities (booms) and constraints (busts) for capital accumulation. Initially, they generated ‘cheap natures’ i.e., cheap labor, energy, raw materials, and food, and resulted in increasing labor productivity, profit rates, and capital accumulation. However, they gradually exhausted the supply of cheap natures. This manifested itself in the local resource depletion, soil exhaustion, deforestation, and falling labor productivity and profits. Consequently, the over-accumulated capital was reinvested in new colonial state-building and capitalist environment-making projects, paving the way for the westward migration of sugar and cotton towards the Western Mediterranean, Atlantic, and Americas. In sum, I develop an account of transition to capitalism and formation of Venetian colonialism ‘as environmental history’ i.e., as socio-ecological processes and projects. I argue that socio-ecological relations, processes, and dynamics that emerged in Cyprus were constitutive of the emerging capitalist colonialism and world-capitalism.",Yeditepe University,,,,,,,,Yeditepe University,,Cagri Idiman,,,,,,,,Cagri Idiman,,Political Economy,Political Sociology,Critical Theory,Marxism,Climate Change,Capitalism,,,"Cyprus, from a Sugar Island to a Cotton Island: Nature, Transition to Capitalism, and Colonialism",https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64865&EventID=185
0,"This paper presents a model of social change that emerged from the Global South as a method to overcome colonial and Racist domination via collective action from below. Despite its effectiveness, it is being marginalised not only in academic human rights discourses but also in European social movement research. This framework includes a specific understanding of power and social change, which inspired strategic resistance for the decolonisation of India, against white supremacy in the United States and the long struggle against apartheid in South Africa, as well as many other post-colonial struggles, and is often neglected in mainstream debates. 
Decolonising our research not only requires taking seriously and making space for heuristic tools and methodologies from struggles of marginalised communities but also designing research in a way that strengthens and supports the struggle of such communities and of us all to overcome oppression in our structures and work. 
And this requires understanding when and how oppressed communities can act collectively for their rights, which again requires understanding the dynamics and shifts in power relations between involved groups that precede the institutionalisation of human, civil, labour and other rights. Particularly important are dynamics between those that benefit from the status quo and those that are oppressed by it. This power-blindness of concrete social actors, beyond states, is especially striking in international law and peace studies. Power dynamics do not vanish if they are ignored. Rather they can only be transformed after having been acknowledged and understood. 
Interestingly the understanding of power underlying this model of social change, is very different from the domination-focused Weberian power-over-concept, as it contrarily emphasises the inter-dependence of social actors. Its theory of power and change is not only empowering for communities but also has a very subversive potential in that it sheds light on where the power of those that appear powerless lies and how even the seemingly most brutal and powerful colonisers and oppressors depend on the contribution and cooperation of many social groups and people, which can be an entry-point for disruption and liberation. 
This contribution seeks to make room for this marginalised model of social change developed by communities themselves as part of learning feedback loops in their struggles for liberation and against oppression. There is an existing field of research of civil resistance or nonviolent action that continues to learn from these concepts underlying the struggles of oppressed and marginalised communities, and the involved theories and research findings are relevant to a variety of neighbouring fields, such as international law, particularly human rights, social movement research, and peace and conflict studies. 
The paper presents the main concepts of this model, and how it has been further elaborated by both practitioners and allied researchers in the past century. It will then lay out a research agenda based on this basic framework and show the relevance for various areas of studies, to finally discuss some implications of this approach for both research and active communities.",University of Wollongong,,,,,,,,University of Wollongong,,Dalilah Shemia-Goeke,,,,,,,,Dalilah Shemia-Goeke,,Citizenship,Civil Society,Social Justice,Social Movements,Activism,,,,De-Colonising Human Rights by learning from the Global South: A marginalised model of social change that emerged in self-determination struggles of oppressed communities,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64622&EventID=185
0,"While the European Union (EU) still grapples with Poland and Hungary’s selective application and controversial interpretation of EU law, it is oft overlooked that the circumvention of the EU’s legal framework and procedures has long served as a means to create differentiation. In fact, this phenomenon scholars refer to as de facto differentiation is not limited to insubordination of member states but occurs also in the form of long-lasting arrangements tolerated by the EU. This article adopts a rationalist perspective and employs a supply and demand model to assess why this form of differentiation is demanded by states and tolerated by the EU despite the availability of legal means of differentiation. The model’s propositions were tested in three illustrative case studies in Economic and Monetary Union (EMU): (1) Sweden’s de facto opt-out from EMU; (2) Kosovo’s adoption of the euro as sole legal tender, and (3) the creation of the Fiscal Compact as an international treaty outside EU law. Ultimately, it was found that de facto differentiation may constitute a viable alternative and useful means to make EU integration more flexible when strong national demand for differentiation meets the need for discretion or timely action. This, however, applies only to cases in which the integrity of the EU’s key principles is not threatened.",University of Agder,,,,,,,,University of Agder,,Tobias Hofelich,,,,,,,,Tobias Hofelich,,European Union,Differentiation,Eurozone,,,,,,De-facto differentiation in Economic and Monetary Union: A Rationalist Explanation,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=62275&EventID=185
0,"This paper introduces the idea of ‘de-sovereignisation’ as a new way of conceptualising Russia’s involvement in post-Soviet de facto states – territorial entities having de facto but lacking de jure sovereignty, the creation and survival of which rely on Russia as the patron state. De-sovereignisation is defined as the process(es) through which a state facilitates state- and nation-building practices that interfere with another state’s ability to exercise control and authority over portions of its territory and population, that is, administer parts of its internationally recognised jurisdiction. Spanning policy domains, these processes operate as means of diplomatic pressure: they gradually help de facto states acquire various attributes of sovereignty and statehood, thereby weakening those of their respective parent states, in turn making them more vulnerable to Russia’s interference. Focusing on Transdniestria and the Donetsk and Luhansk Peoples’ Republics (DPR/LPR), this paper examines the ways in which the official rhetoric and diplomatic initiatives promoted by de facto leaders and Russian officials ‘de-sovereignise’ Moldova and Ukraine. It comprises four parts.

The first part illustrates how de facto states challenge conventional definitions of ‘sovereignty’ and how de-sovereignisation processes are equally informed by Russian elites’ understanding of state interests and their beliefs about sovereignty.

The second part analyses de facto authorities’ public statements and programmatic documents. These indicate the aspiration to obtain international recognition and integrate with Russia. This aspiration clashes with Russia’s official diplomatic position for these regions to be granted autonomy and reintegrated into their respective parent state through a federative arrangement to be embedded in the two countries’ constitutions. Constitutional enshrinement would maximise Moscow’s efforts to influence Ukraine and Moldova from within. Russia can position itself as a mediator in rather than a party to both conflicts by portraying them as civil wars. Urging central authorities in Chisinau and Kyiv to negotiate directly with the de facto leaders helps Moscow elevate the international political status of Transdniestria and the DPR/LPR.

The third part investigates Russia’s diplomatic engagement with the de facto governments through the signing of bilateral cooperation agreements and the establishment of representation offices. These initiatives add a new level of complexity, given that formally Russia refuses to recognise these entities as independent states (though this may change). 

The fourth part explores the paradox underlying Russia’s role as the patron state. Integration processes with Russia successfully alienate these regions from their parent states as a destabilising mechanism in the short-term. Over time, the local population is forced to reorient itself towards Russia. However, the deeper integration processes with Russia grow, the less feasible reintegration plans become, paradoxically obstructing Moscow’s strategy to create a ‘state-within-a-state’ arrangement for Transdniestria and the DPR/LPR to its advantage. Moreover, practical challenges connected to the lack of international status may exacerbate local grievances and weaken the legitimacy of the de facto leadership, with important implications for the success of de-sovereignisation as an instrument of Russian diplomatic pressure.

0,"Research on democratic disruption in Europe has increasingly expanded from studying democratic backsliding to considering forms of democratic resilience and anti-populist pushback: civic mobilisation and the robustness of institutions, but mainstream parties’ reaction to populist challengers and populist erosion of democracy (Guasti 2020; Boese at al 2021; Luhrmann 2021). Such autocratisation-oriented approaches often stress the formation of broad mainstream coalitions capable of winning critical elections (Kaltwasser 2017; Eisen et al. 2019, 12–25; Grahn, Lührmann, and Gastaldi 2020), but also incorporate typologies of mainstream responses, which view the populist-mainstream dynamic in terms of programmatic competition in changing, but stable democratic systems 
(Bale et al. 2010; Mudde 2019; Abou-Chadi and Wagner 2019; 2020; Spoon and Klüver 2020). 

Much such literature leans on assumptions drawn from Western European contexts: 1) that populist challengers are – or originate on - the illiberal right and 2) that there is a clear, if declining, core of established mainstream parties. These transfer imperfectly to Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) where populist challengers are both ‘centrist’ or ‘technocratic’ and culturally illiberal forms (Stanley 2017; Bustíková and Guasti 2019); and mainstream parties poorly institutionalised imitations of West European models sooner or later swept away by voter frustration with corruption and policy failure (Pop-Eleches 2010; Haughton and Krause 2020). This may skew the strategic responses available to mainstream parties - and add complexity and uncertainty to the strategic environment: centrist populists’ programmatic vagueness, lack of traditional ideological radicalism, and ability to make huge overnight electoral breakthroughs, for example, may rule out traditional cordon sanitaire strategies and obscure the illiberal implications of their gaining office.

This paper explores these issues through a case study of the Czech Social Democrats’ (ČSSD) relationship with - and understanding of-the populist ANO movement of billionaire businessman Andrej Babiš. The paper first tracks the two parties’ relationship in the period 2011-2021 against the background of rising populism (and anti-populism) (Havlík 2012; 2019); broader democratic deterioration (Hanley and Vachudova 2018; Guasti 2018; 2020); and ČSSD’s steady decline from major party of government to minor and, ultimately, extra-parliamentary status; and relates ČSSD responses – and debates– to comparative typologies of anti-populist response. 

The paper considers Czech social democrats’ varied framings of ANO and political learning processes as revealed in published contributions by party representatives. These suggest that social democrats failed to grasp the dynamism, novelty, and adaptability of Babiš’s movement, misperceiving it either as a form of conventional right-wing pro-market politics or an ephemeral phenomenon which would rapidly collapse; and that contradictions in the party’s strategy were exacerbated by an inability to reconcile views of ANO as political competitor and as anti-system party threatening the democratic order (Klíma and Medilow 2016).

The conclusions discuss how existing frameworks might be adjusted  for contexts marked by ‘centrist’ rather than radical populism and whether studies of contemporary CEE democratic decline may benefit from more incorporation of ideational frames of the type undertaken in studies of historical patterns of democratic resilience (Berman 1998; Capoccia 2007; Ziblatt and Capoccia 2010).",University College London,,,,,,,,University College London,,Sean Hanley,,,,,,,,Sean Hanley,,Europe (Central and Eastern),Democracy,Democratisation,Political Parties,Populism,,,,Dealing with ‘centrist populists’: A case study of Czech Social Democrat responses to Andrej Babiš’s ANO movement 2011-2021,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63410&EventID=185

However, only few presidents have the right to take the floor beyond such occasions. This paper explores the hitherto under-researched constitutional prerogative of select presidents to participate in parliamentary debates and address the legislature at their discretion. Based on a comprehensive examination of parliamentary minutes in Czechoslovakia, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Moldova and Slovakia, 1990-2020, the paper maps and analyses presidential engagement with the legislature through speeches and interpellations. The analysis shows remarkable cross-country differences in frequency, content, and length of remarks. Thereby, patterns are largely reflective of political circumstances, institutional configurations, and presidential leadership styles. However, the analysis also highlights the difficulties in formulating more general theory.

0,"Participatory arrangements have become more common in political decision-making. In particular, deliberative mini-publics have seen a strong increase all over the world (OECD, 2020). In these mini-publics, small groups of ordinary citizens are invited to discuss their opinions on a certain political issue and, based on these discussions, formulate policy recommendations. As a result of the increased use of these participatory processes, a fair share of situations emerge in which it is not possible for politicians for various reasons to follow recommendations of these processes. How do citizens react to these situations?

There is limited support among the public and academics to authorize mini-publics to make binding political decisions (Goldberg & Bächtiger, 2021). At the same time, recent studies showed that ignoring mini-publics’ recommendations can harm legitimacy perceptions among citizens (Germann et al., 2021; Van Dijk & Lefevere, in press). How does the public react when a clash occurs between citizens’ recommendations and politicians’ decisions? Can politicians gain public acceptance for decisions which go against a mini-public’s recommendations? 

Drawing on studies within procedural fairness theory and political communication, we argue that politicians’ communication that signals consideration of mini-publics’ recommendations can mitigate the potential negative effects on citizens’ legitimacy perceptions that can result from not following the recommendations. The provision of public justifications, i.e. public explanations why certain decisions are taken, is one way to communicate consideration. Recent studies showed that justifications can indeed increase decision acceptance, even among the losers of the decision (de Fine Licht et al., 2021). 

To test our argument, we designed and preregistered two survey experiments in Belgium on the salient topics of climate and safety policy and manipulate how politicians engage with the mini-public recommendations. The findings will provide important insights into the interplay between different forms and practices of decision-making and the potential of justifications to alleviate potential negative effects following a clash between input of citizens and decisions of politicians. Moreover, studies connecting participatory processes to (elite communication in) the mass media are still very scarce yet it is a key venue via which citizens receive their political information. This study also contributes to filling this gap.",Universiteit Antwerpen,University of Gothenburg,University of Leuven,,,,,,Universiteit Antwerpen,,Ine Goovaerts,Jenny De Fine Licht,Sofie Marien,,,,,,Ine Goovaerts,,Political Participation,Communication,Decision Making,Policy-Making,,,,,Decision Acceptance in Times of Participatory Political Decision-Making,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64187&EventID=185
0,"Deliberative democracy advances an emancipatory project of inclusion, equality, and freedom. Yet these ideals have been produced in a particular economic and cultural context. Emerging out of the humanist Enlightenment tradition and inspired by linguistic and critical theories, deliberative democracy is deeply rooted in Western academia. This also means that despite its emancipatory impetus, it emerged in a context marked by colonial thinking. In this paper, we argue that if deliberative democracy is to unfold its full democratic potential, it needs to face the colonial traces it may carry within it. 

The article proposes six moves towards decolonizing deliberative democracy. In order not to remain in the a purely negative, deconstructive impetus of decolonization, we also want to sketch a positive, reconstructive way forward. Hence, the first three moves we are proposing are deconstructive and aim at deepening critical reflection while the other three moves mark a concrete starting point for a decolonial reconstruction of deliberative democracy. In proposing these six moves, we do not suggest that decolonizing is a task that can be simply completed, rather we understand decolonizing as a driving force that needs to be a permanent feature of the deliberative democratic project. 

On the deconstructive side, (1) the first move required is the acknowledgement of the violence often hidden by the narrative of modernity. Modernity is deeply dependent on colonial exploitation, racism and xenophobia. Beyond advocating equality as a moral principle, decolonized deliberative democracy requires an extensive critique of the economic inequalities pervading social life and their racial and gendered dimensions. (2) The second move consists of the recognition of the epistemic asymmetries within the knowledge production of deliberative democracy. The asymmetries that dominate academia have several layers of geographical, racial and gender divides cutting across this area of scholarship. This results in the exclusion of knowledges from the Global South as well as from marginalized groups. (3) A third deconstructive move involves reflecting on the colonial drive observable in current approaches to democratic innovations. New deliberative formats are often seen as technologies that can be replicated in any cultural context. The commodification of democracy may express one more form of colonial thinking, in which democracy is reduced to the export of successful innovations from one context to another. Deliberative democracy should be seen as a particular approach, grounded on very specific historic contexts and on some institutional settings that cannot by assumed as universal. 

Linked to these initial moves, we suggest three constructive ones: (1) we need to start by centring on social injustices cutting across democracies; (2) we need to look to the Global South in an actual dialogue, rather than extracting knowledge of exoticized cases; (3) we need to include marginalized groups and people outside academia into the theorizing process and empower their voices in the conceptualization of deliberative democracy.",Federal University of Minas Gerais (Brazil),"Faculty of Business, Government and Law, University of Canberra",,,,,,,Federal University of Minas Gerais (Brazil),,Ricardo Fabrino Mendonça,Hans Asenbaum,,,,,,,Ricardo Fabrino Mendonça,,Democracy,Developing World Politics,Global,,,,,,Decolonizing Deliberative Democracy,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63718&EventID=185
0,"Deliberative mini-publics are portrayed as empowering spaces where a group of ordinary citizens representative of the wider population can reach considered judgment and provide recommendations to public authorities. These portrayals, however, need to be interrogated. For whom are these spaces empowering? Do all citizens (or colegislators) hold equal power to legitimize or endorse a decision or institution? Whose considered judgments and performances are considered legitimate by public authorities and process experts? Which voices and bodies are systematically rendered unheard and invisible as these processes claim to champion diversity?  

This paper answers these questions by drawing on various perspectives of decolonial theory. It argues that deliberative mini-publics, in their current formulation and scope, are complicit to maintaining the privileges of White western democratic theory and practice, as well as the dependencies to systems of domination, racialization and exploitation. It examines the scope and design features of mini-publics – from random selection to facilitation to presentation of expert evidence – and demonstrates how these features, despite good intentions, further entrench dominant epistemologies that maintain today’s global racial order. The paper concludes by exploring the debate on the extent to which this democratic innovation can be reformed or ‘decolonized’ and reflects on the role of scholars and practitioners of public deliberation in decolonizing democracy.",Institute for Advanced Sustainability Studies (IASS),"Faculty of Business, Government and Law, University of Canberra",,,,,,,Institute for Advanced Sustainability Studies (IASS),,Azucena Moran,Nicole Curato,,,,,,,Azucena Moran,,Democracy,Institutions,Developing World Politics,,,,,,Decolonizing Deliberative Mini-Publics,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63719&EventID=185
0,"Substantial research suggests that humans are fundamentally morally attuned beings, with such moral roots deriving either from evolutionary or socialising processes. Recent research shows that most studies overlook the fact that moral psychology theoretical frameworks might be tapping similar underlying moral constructs. In fact, the aspects of how politics and morality are associated can be analysed according to four prominent theories, couched on sociological, linguistic, and psychological traditions. Recent work using a nationally representative American sample uncovered a three-factor structure (Order, Other-Focus, and Self-Focus) crosscutting the four theoretical traditions mentioned earlier. The results showed that morality explained 30% of the variance in political orientation (excluded extreme cases), whereas other covariates (e.g., age, gender, ethnicity, education, income, and religion) accounted for 21% of the variance. These findings suggest that using moral constructs deriving from several theories might better capture variation in political processes, and that moral values predict left-right ideology self-placement better than demographic covariates. In this paper, across three studies and using a large sample (Ntotal = 1066), we employ original methodological and analytical techniques to offer a robust, systematic, and nuanced exploration of the basic moral correlates of American attitudes towards foreign policy and international affairs. We adopt the three-factor basic structure of morality, and test how these are associated with general postures towards international affairs (e.g., isolationism) and specific foreign policy issues (e.g., engagement with the United Nations). Pilot Study and Study 1 establish patterns of moral macro-factors associations with attitudes towards international affairs. In Study 2, we replicate and generalise the findings of previous studies, extend them to the foreign policy issues, and test whether and how moral value’s effects on foreign policy attitudes are channelled through general postures. To reduce the variance in our findings, we present our results using a meta-analytic synthesis. Our studies have three overarching contributions to the study of the micro-foundations of international relations. We first replicate the three-factor structure and establish which theory-specific moral constructs are unique in the associations between morality macro-factors and international issues. Next, we explore the role of different moral values in accounting for attitudes towards foreign policy and international affairs. Last, we connect the macro and micro levels of analysis by testing which are the specific and more basic elements within each of the four morality traditions that account the most for each of the views of world. More importantly, we contend and provide evidence that multiple moral values are at the micro-foundations of national interest interpretations. Studying the underlying psychological mechanisms of their moral values offers an innovative angle to understand how individuals think about the world, how they frame their interests about the international, and more broadly, allow us a window to predict how public opinion will behave and frame states’ behaviour and future of international politics.",University of Copenhagen,,,,,,,,University of Copenhagen,,Fabricio Chagas-Bastos,,,,,,,,Fabricio Chagas-Bastos,,Foreign Policy,International Relations,Political Psychology,Experimental Design,Survey Experiments,Survey Research,,,Decomposing the Moral Structure of Attitudes Towards Foreign Policy and International Affairs,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65314&EventID=185
0,"During the last few years, the Polish right-wing populist party-in-power (PiS) has changed its stance on European Green Deal by moving towards a reluctant acceptance to achieve carbon neutrality until 2050. Similarly, the public opinion has also shifted over the last five years towards higher recognition of climate change as a serious threat, higher acceptance of a need for climate mitigation policies and, in particular, higher support for decarbonization in Poland. Falling costs of renewable energy sources and increasing costs of carbon energy in Poland, as well as generous funding from the European Union for just energy transition were important factors shaping the public opinion and, especially, the ruling political parties’ stance on achieving the climate neutrality. However, I argue that the crucial shift in public opinion – although still fragile and not irreversible - happened largely due to the climate activists’ efforts to decouple the climate issue from the leftist agenda. Indeed, the issue of energy transition in Poland is still largely associated with the political and ideological conflict that has especially strengthened under the rule of the right-wing populist government.  Decouple the issue of climate change from those of women’s rights, LGBTQ rights, anti-racism and anti-capitalism might have been a turning point, which shifted an otherwise polarized public opinion towards a more consensual one on the issue of climate change policy. In order to test this hypothesis, I conduct a discourse analysis of the main narratives of the key climate activists’ groups between 2018 and 2021 and perform process tracing connecting the narratives with the shift in public opinion.","Institute for Structural Research, Warsaw",,,,,,,,"Institute for Structural Research, Warsaw",,Baiba Witajewska-Baltvilka,,,,,,,,Baiba Witajewska-Baltvilka,,Climate Change,Public Opinion,Activism,Energy Policy,,,,,Decoupling the Climate Change Issue from the Left-Wing Agenda: Potential Turning Point for Successful Energy Transition in Poland?,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65849&EventID=185
0,"The ‘politicisation of Europe’ has mainly been discussed with reference to Eurosceptic forces in the ‘conventional’ party-political arena, not least parties on the radical right (see Hutter et al., 2016). More recently, however, citizens have started to come out to defend the EU or the broader principle of European integration. From the perspective of the anti-Brexit campaign in the UK and Pulse of Europe in Germany, we address this new phenomenon and the contents of activists’ messaging in particular. Using concepts from the social movements literature, our comparative analysis of campaign materials and interview data reveals that the ability of these movements to make sustainable contribution to the politicisation of Europe has been constrained by their apparent inability to construct a) diagnostic frames that find the right balance between problematising the current political situation whilst supporting the established order; and b) prognostic frames that extend beyond a defence of a status quo that has been subject to growing public dissatisfaction.",Kings College London,"Queen Mary, University of London",,,,,,,"Queen Mary, University of London",,Adam Fagan,Stijn van Kessel,,,,,,,Stijn van Kessel,,Comparative Politics,European Politics,European Union,Social Movements,Euroscepticism,Protests,Activism,,Defending the status quo: the dilemmas of pro-European activism in Germany and the UK,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64616&EventID=185
0,"Recently, several liberal states have adopted laws that allow them to unilaterally revoke citizenships of their members due to concerns about terrorism. This new power is, however, controversial because citizenship is generally considered to be a secured, irrevocable status of members in liberal societies. In this article, I defend the permissibility of denationalization practices that target only egregious cases of political wrongdoing, understood to be wrongs committed against the integrity of liberal democratic institutions or violations of others’ democratic rights with a wrongful intention. I argue that denationalization, when properly constrained, is a justifiable response by liberal states to political wrongdoing. More specifically, I put forward a negative retributivist account for denationalization supplemented by instrumentalist and expressivist concerns. The retributivist argument aims to establish that it is not wrong to sanction certain political wrongdoers with denationalization. In addition, I offer some positive justifications for denationalization by, first, raising the instrumentalist concern of protecting democratic institutions and democratic ways of life, and, second, highlighting of expressivist value of denationalizing political wrongdoers in some cases. 

Two groups of individuals are targeted by my account of denationalization. The first group is the individuals who wrongfully pose a severe risk of harm to the democratic institutions of their country of citizenship. The second group consists of individuals who pose a severe risk of harm to the political rights of people in other countries. 

My arguments make the following contributions to the literature: first, my arguments can explain the fittingness of denationalization as a punishment for political wrongdoing but not other types of serious crimes. Second, my arguments apply to individuals who pose a significant threat to the democratic institutions of the denationalizing country as well as those who undermine the democratic rights of people in other countries. Third, my arguments imply that denationalization should target the most powerful, rather than the least powerful. Hence, they can be used to criticize the current practices of citizenship revocation laws that disproportionately affect Muslim citizens.",Hong Kong Baptist University,,,,,,,,Hong Kong Baptist University,,Kevin Ip,,,,,,,,Kevin Ip,,Citizenship,Democracy,Political Theory,Ethics,Liberalism,Normative Theory,,,Defensible Denationalization and Political Wrongdoing,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64342&EventID=185
0,"A key challenge of a democratic political system is to reconcile the trade-off between reflexive and responsive decision-making. Representative democracy appeared to resolve this tension, as a degree of reflexivity is ensured by the cognitive independence of representatives, whilst responsiveness is guaranteed through links of accountability to the electorate (Dahl 1989). However, representative systems have been struggling to ensure both reflexivity and responsiveness, engendering a crisis of trust and accountability that is also fuelling populistic responses. This has led to a plethora of democratic innovations that attempted to remedy the deficits in the representative system. Yet many of these processes, for instance deliberative mini-publics, have been criticised on similar grounds; whilst being championed for their reflexiveness, they have been criticised for their lack of responsiveness. This paper investigates whether participatory systems that link together different participatory arenas provide a more promising avenue for democratic reform. The paper first conceptualises a participatory system as sets of participation-facilitating arenas (digital/ analogue; invited/ invented; based on coproduction or agonistic), linked together to connect the different forms of labours they perform. It then develops a framework for understanding these links that goes beyond current theories of ""sequencing"" and ""coupling"". This framework is then deployed on real examples of participatory systems to elaborate the ways in which information flows between arenas, in an effort to understand whether participatory systems can successfully reconcile the difficult trade-offs between competing democratic functions.",Manchester Metropolitan University,De Montfort University,Johann Wolfgang Goethe-Universität Frankfurt,,,,,,Manchester Metropolitan University,,Sonia Bussu,Adrian Bua,Rikki Dean,,,,,,Sonia Bussu,,Democracy,Institutions,Representation,Empirical,Policy-Making,,,,Defining and assessing participatory systems,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64782&EventID=185
0,"Environmental politics have long been depicted in terms of a tension between what is ecologically necessary and what is politically possible. Climate movements that engage in imagining alternative futures seek to overcome this tension, and ultimately the contemporary ‘crisis of imagination’ in relation to envisioning alternative futures. Yet how they define and negotiate what is necessary and/or possible has long been overlooked. Through the case of the 2022 Swedish Climate Parliament, which brings together 150 proposals for addressing the current climate crisis, we explore how environmental organizations as well as engaged individual citizens define the desirability and plausibility of their and others’ proposals in terms of necessity and possibility. If we consider being able to imagine as a first step toward creating certain futures, analyzing these articulations and processes presents important spaces of hyperprojectivity in which the social production of futures can be observed. We explore various elements that activists draw on in articulating the necessity and possibility of proposals, including the temporality of climate change and climate politics, political and discursive opportunities, and collective political efficacy. We furthermore compare the discursive legitimization of narratives focusing on either possibility or necessity, hypothesizing that each reflect reformist and radical politics, respectively, and that both will come with distinct discursive strategies to define their desirability and plausibility.

0,"Recent research depicts a critical role of ordinary citizens in the currently witnessable process of democratic erosion around the globe. Democracy’s citizens are reported to tolerate undemocratic behavior by political elites or support the erosion of accountability mechanisms in exchange for different kinds of gains (Singer 2018; Graham und Svolik 2020; Saikkonen und Christensen 2021). The literature reports citizens to be willing to exchange democracy for policy, ideology, governmental power, governmental and economic performance and due to polarization. Confronted with this rather conditional support for democracy the question emerges what drivers lie behind citizens willingness to tolerate undemocratic behavior, or rather which citizens are willing to “trade democracy off”.
One potential source of such willingness may lie in the understandings citizens hold of the term “democracy” (Lu und Chu 2021; Wunsch et al. 2022). These represent the measures people use to evaluate, support or reject political systems and to act politically in them (Osterberg-Kaufmann et al. 2020). Research on meanings and understandings of democracy has time and time again found “instrumental” understandings of democracy to be widespread, even within established democracies. Such instrumental, rather than intrinsic or principled understandings of democracy, are argued to value democracy for its ability to deliver favored goods, policies and different kinds of governmental or economic performance. Yet, while this assumption has been held for quite some time, it has not been explicitly tested, especially with regard to the currently witnessable gradual erosion of democracy from within and citizens reported willingness to tolerate undemocratic behavior.
To answer the question if instrumental democrats are more willing to trade democracy off than principled democrats, and for which gains, this paper leverages comparative survey-data of the Global Barometer Survey II and the Asia Barometer Survey IV. Based on these data-sources, the paper investigates instrumental democrats’ willingness to support the erosion of accountability mechanisms measured via survey-items. Based on its findings, the paper comes to the conclusion that instrumental democrats are in fact more willing to exchange gains or outputs for support for executive extensions of power, but not for all gains alike. Furthermore, it calls into question the exclusively positive role that has been associated with procedural democrats.",Johannes Gutenberg-Universität Mainz,,,,,,,,Johannes Gutenberg-Universität Mainz,,Matthias Rosenthal,,,,,,,,Matthias Rosenthal,,Democracy,Public Opinion,Political Cultures,,,,,,Delegating away or trading off democracy?

0,"Agencification in the EU stretches the confines of the European regulatory state to the maximum by swelling to policy domains, such as health security, that were formerly the exclusive terrain of national institutions. While the challenge to legitimize EU-level non-majoritarian institutions is widely acknowledged, rigorous empirical studies on the conditions under which EU-level authority prevails or fails are scarce. To fill this gap, we provide a very first empirical test of the well-established claims about the non-majoritarian versus derived legitimation sources on which EU agencies can be regarded as rightful regulators. We draw on a survey experiment with 812 Dutch local politicians on their legitimacy perceptions about the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and its mandate to authorize vaccines in view of cross-border health security risks. The results suggest that the EMA is perceived as an exceedingly legitimate agency, and the non-majoritarian sources are sufficient to legitimize the EMA’s authority to approve vaccines for the use in The Netherlands.","Departments of Political Science and Public Administration, Universiteit Leiden","Departments of Political Science and Public Administration, Universiteit Leiden",,,,,,,"Departments of Political Science and Public Administration, Universiteit Leiden",,Dovilė Rimkutė,Honorata Mazepus,,,,,,,Dovilė Rimkutė,,European Union,Regulation,Knowledge,Experimental Design,,,,,Delegation without legitimation?

0,"Road transport accounts for one-fifth of greenhouse gas emissions in Finland and therefore rapid and profound transitions are needed in the transport sector to achieve the national goal of carbon neutrality by 2035. The most effective policy measures to curb transport emissions include negative economic incentives such as congestion fees and an increase in the tax on automobile fuel. However, these measures have distributional impacts, and their implementation is politically challenging. The pressing question, then, is how to put into action ambitious traffic policies to reach the carbon neutrality targets in an effective, just and socially acceptable manner.
In this paper, we analyse a citizens’ jury (CJ) process that was organized in the Uusimaa region, Finland, to address the ways to curb greenhouse gas emissions from passenger cars. A four-day CJ with 40 jurors will be convened in April 2022 in collaboration with the Uusimaa Regional Council. We present the results of the CJ and discuss them in the light of theory-based assumptions on environmental deliberation: Did the jurors learn about traffic policy measures and their impacts and reflect on their initial positions and interests on the matter? Did they develop a concern for others and shift their positions towards less self-interested ones?  And were the citizens more able to adopt a long-term perspective on transport transitions than politicians who have to balance between different short-term interests? We also explore the ways in which policymakers receive the CJ results and utilize them in decision-making processes.     
The analysis is based on participant observation, interpretive analysis of transcribed CJ discussions, pre- and post-treatment questionnaires as well as application of Q-method with the jurors.

0,"The historic Mabo v Queensland (No 2) is arguably the most important legal case in Australia’s history. In Mabo, the High Court of Australia declared the Australian legal system could now recognise the pre-colonial rights (‘native title’) of Indigenous people over their traditional lands under their own laws. The decision overturned the infamous and prevailing legal doctrine of terra nullius (land belonging to no one) which justified British colonisation and dispossession of Indigenous people in Australia. The Australian government responded to the decision by introducing Native Title Act 1993 to provide for the legal recognition and protection of native title. Mabo and the Native Title Act 1993 were viewed as the opportunity to reset the political and legal relationship between Indigenous Australians and the state and deliver greater gains including the right to self-determination and self-government. 

Yet, three decades on from Mabo and Indigenous Australians remain the most socioeconomically disadvantaged and politically marginalised group in Australia. The state continues to deny any right to self-government despite Indigenous and legal scholars arguing any recognition of Indigenous rights in land presupposes a recognition of an inherent right to self-government. The right to a form of self-government has attained a prominent place in contemporary political and public debates on Indigenous-state relations in Australia.

This paper seeks to makes a contribution to understanding the usefulness of deliberative democratic theory in relation to settler colonialism, Indigenous peoples, and their claims to self-government in Australia. Drawing on my research and the work of Indigenous and legal scholars from Australia and other settler colonial states such as Canada, the paper seeks to demonstrate native title has been a catalyst for the creation of a distinct political space for Indigenous people to engage with the state and other actors. Using deliberative democratic theory the paper will illustrate that though native title is a creation of Australia’s settler colonial legal and political system, Indigenous people nonetheless use native title to engage with the state to assert self government claims, redefine the politics of place and engage in acts of decolonisation through public policy.",Australian National University,,,,,,,,Australian National University,,Justin McCaul,,,,,,,,Justin McCaul,,Civil Society,Democracy,Decision Making,,,,,,Deliberating Native Title,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63720&EventID=185
0,"Over the last few years, the emergence of the Internet of Things and the increasingly advanced development of what we might call a true “algorithm culture” have highlighted the importance of artificial intelligence in everyday life. At the same time, the development of digital platforms and the affirmation of the process of the ""platformisation"" of society have accompanied both the radical transformation of the public sphere and the structural mutation of representative democracy. In this perspective, the forms of citizen participation and, more generally, the experiences of democratic innovation have been confronted with the need to adopt technological tools capable of increasing the quality of democracy, improving deliberative processes, and encouraging a wider participation of citizens. The initial successes of online platforms for democratic participation and deliberation have been followed by moments of difficulty, especially in the processes of the “scaling up” of participation. In this situation, the adoption of artificial intelligence appeared to be a possibility for the quantitative (and potentially also qualitative) growth of civic participation. At the same time, artificial intelligence has entered both essential services (such as health and care) and education processes and, finally, the most advanced forms of social innovation. Several issues or aspects have thus emerged that require attention: from the relationship between solidarity and artificial intelligence to the need to make AI compatible with policies in favor of diversity and inclusion; from the egalitarian development of artificial intelligence to its ecological sustainability; from the interrelationship between artificial intelligence and respect for privacy to the need to adopt a democratic principle in the choice and control of algorithms. This last aspect immediately appeared to be very delicate: artificial intelligence, in fact, should be framed in an ethical and responsible dimension, as noted by the working group led by the Université de Montreal (Responsible Artificial Intelligence: a guide for deliberation). Deliberating on Artificial Intelligence and deliberating with Artificial Intelligence are two distinct processes but which show clear signs of convergence. This paper analyses the policies of development in the use of artificial intelligence in Italy, adopting a double access key: a) on the one hand, the participatory processes (also of private companies) on the use of artificial intelligence have been studied; b) on the other hand, the participatory processes which have made use (also in a partial and marginal way) of tools and/or logic of artificial intelligence have been also put under investigation. The policies and processes were studied in the light of the paradigm of ""responsible artificial intelligence"" (The Montréal Declaration for a Responsible Development of AI, 2018). A specific focus was devoted to the presence of elements related to the themes of diversity, inclusion, and gender equality, also in the light of their potential impact on the objectives of the 2030 Agenda.",LUISS University,LUISS University,LUISS University,,,,,,LUISS University,,Emiliana De Blasio,Michele Sorice,Donatella Selva,,,,,,Michele Sorice,,Cyber Politics,Democracy,Governance,Decision Making,Big Data,,,,Deliberating on AI and with AI: analysing civic participation in the platform society,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64884&EventID=185
0,"Consociational governing arrangements are often prescribed for deeply divided societies. The Belfast/Good Friday Agreement of 1998 established devolved power-sharing institutions in Northern Ireland, helping to bring to an end three decades of ethno-national conflict. While many recognise the Agreement’s contribution to the fundamental goal of peace, devolved power-sharing in Northern Ireland has been far from a case study of good governance. The institutions have proven vulnerable to collapse on multiple occasions and consequential policy outputs remain scarce. More than two decades since their creation, survey evidence shows that there is appetite among citizens from across the political spectrum for the institutions to be reformed in some way. However, it is less clear what specific reforms the public would like to see introduced and, crucially, whether potential reforms are likely to receive cross-community support. In this paper, we present evidence from a deliberative mini-public held in Northern Ireland in 2022. After receiving information from independent experts about the nature of the current system and different ways in which it may be reformed, namely towards a voluntary coalition or qualified voluntary coalition model, a diverse sample of citizens was asked to discuss and weigh up the main options. We use pre- and post-surveys to demonstrate the ways in which citizens’ attitudes towards different models of power-sharing change or stay the same after learning about and discussing the issues. This quantitative evidence is supplemented with qualitative data from small-group discussions to help identify the reasons underlying participants’ views. The findings will help to inform the contemporary debate about institutional reform in Northern Ireland, as well as deepen our understanding more generally of the nature of public attitudes towards established consociational arrangements.",University of Liverpool,Queen's University Belfast,,,,,,,Queen's University Belfast,,Sean Haughey,James Pow,,,,,,,James Pow,,Ethnic Conflict,Executives,Governance,Institutions,Political Participation,Coalition,Mixed Methods,Public Opinion,Deliberating the reform of power-sharing institutions: Evidence from a mini-public in Northern Ireland,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64909&EventID=185
0,"In recent years concerns over the prevalence of online misinformation and its possible threats to democratic politics have become widespread. Popular and academic discussions of fake news as resulting from partisan biases and motivated reasoning have been particularly prominent in fuelling pessimism over the competence of democratic citizens and democratic debate. By surveying recent empirical research, my aim in this paper is to offer a more optimistic picture in respect to the challenges online misinformation presents for deliberative democracy. I start by analysing the popular ‘partisan account’ which claims fake and hyperpartisan news is driven by individual partisan biases. I argue that this view implicates democratic deliberation in the spread of false news stories, suggests undemocratic solutions of elite gatekeeping and censorship, and reinforces anti-democratic discourses over citizen incompetence. Recent empirical evidence, however, is found not to clearly support the partisan account and to suggest a lack of reflection on the part of citizens may be more important than bias. While this alternative ‘inattentive account’ presents its own threats to deliberative democracy, it also points to the possibility of more democratic solutions which target citizens’ latent deliberative capacities so they can themselves determine the accuracy of information. The paper then evaluates three types of democratic solutions as alternatives to elite gatekeeping.",University of Manchester,,,,,,,,University of Manchester,,Jonathan Benson,,,,,,,,Jonathan Benson,,Democracy,Political Theory,Decision Making,Public Opinion,,,,,Deliberative democracy and the problem of misinformation,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64497&EventID=185
0,"This paper is about the concept of play and games in democratic theory and practice. When we say that democracy is a game — and should be played like one  — we are not denigrating it. Instead, we are following the lead of cultural theorists such as Johan Huizinga, Roger Caillois, and James P. Carse who have argued that play is an expression of what is most noble in human relations. Play is how we interact when we respect each other, when we recognize the skills, humanity, contributions, and worth of others, and when we strive to win without seeking to annihilate. Our analysis of democracy as play helps make sense of — and justify — aspects of democracy that are confounding but also desirable and essential: the pretending, hypocrisy, rhetoric, exaggeration, and strategizing, on the one hand; and the willingness to treat one’s competitors as worthy opponents rather than existential enemies, on the other hand. We also analyze forms of fair and foul play that go beyond familiar discussions about following or breaking rules and norms. The conditions that facilitate a politics of play are difficult to establish and maintain, but play is an essential component of democratic theory and practice.

0,"This paper examines the impact of political emotions upon the democratic process. The negative emotions of anger, envy and fear may  at times lead to the destruction of a democratic state, as exemplified by certain recent phenomena of illiberal democracy. In the ethics of Kant, the positive emotions play an important role in forming us into moral agents, and Nussbaum, like Kant, postulates a ""cultivation of emotions"" through the medium of education. This process may also be applied to the negative emotion of collective anger, which may be similarly transformed and rationalized with the aim of weakening its impact on human lives. In recent years, the emotion of envy, directed towards the elites of wealth and power, blamed for depriving many people of the opportunity to lead a dignified life, has  also demonstrated a palpable absence of “real democracy”. Some sort of rationalization of this emotion is now called for in order to establish a framework for social discussion, and to formulate the actual postulates being fought for, such as freedom and/or improvements in standards of living. 

I will argue here that a defense of rationality in the public sphere is now essential if we are to protect and maintain democracy, just as was the case in the time of Kant. In our present era of “post-truth politics”, many politicians are choosing not to refer to rational argumentation and truth, but instead use  language solely to manipulate the emotions of the electorate.  Hopefully, the current crisis in democracy is not irreversible and may be overcome through the efforts of rational citizens, supported by the Internet and independent public media, as well as by social media. While advances in modern technology may be of service to a dictatorship when they are used for propaganda purposes, they may also support and bolster freedom and democracy. Their role in this case is to foster positive human emotions so that citizens might find some outlet for them by performing rational and peaceful actions, thereby maintaining a culture of democracy.",Jagiellonian University,,,,,,,,Jagiellonian University,,Justyna Miklaszewska,,,,,,,,Justyna Miklaszewska,,Democracy,Education,Political Cultures,,,,,,Democracy at the Crossroads: Emotions and Political Change,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64528&EventID=185
0,"This paper investigates online debates in support and in opposition to mandatory Coronavirus vaccination laws in Austria. It is based on an analysis of Twitter data selected around specific hashtags (such as #impfpflicht, #impfzwang etc) collected between the official announcement of the Austrian government that a mandatory vaccination law would be introduced until the entry into force of the law. The paper combines network analysis with content analysis to map the main actors and clusters in the virtual debate about mandatory vaccination, as well as to identify the arguments and concepts they use to make their case. Twitter data is complemented with analysis of documents by key actors (public officials, activists and civil society organizations).
Theoretically, the paper contributes to current debates about transnational political mobilization and civil society digital activism, as well as to the literature on democratic transformations. It focuses in particular on (1) how the conflict surrounding mandatory anti-Corona measures, and in particular the mandatory vaccination laws, are generating new social and political cleavages that cut across left and right; (2) how both the pro- and anti-vaccine camps mobilize the language of democracy to defend their respective positions, and how key concepts such as freedom, autonomy and self-determination get reconfigured in this process; and (3) how digital activism is impacting the mobilization for and against the Coronavirus measures, generating transnational public spheres where ideas about democracy are both transmitted and contested.

0,"Although the use of democratic innovations becomes more popular, some doubts concerning their integrity or democratiness arise. It is also questioned whether and how the design and implementation of these innovations can be further democratised or improved.
The key stage of the participatory and deliberative processes is the implementation of their recommendations. The evaluation models created in literature, among other criteria of evaluation of both participatory and deliberative processes, mentions their influence on public policies (Rowe, Frezer 2000, Gutmann, Thompson 2004, Gastil, Knobloch, Kelly 2012), likelihood of implementation of their recommendations (Crosby, Kelly, Schaefer 1986) or their long term effects (Gastil, Knobloch, Kelly 2012).
Nowadays one of the popular deliberative processes that are used as a citizen participation tool is the citizens' assembly (CA). Despite their popularity, most of the CAs are not institutionalised yet and the implementation of their recommendations is not legally regulated. Additionally, it often remains unknown if the recommendations of the CAs are implemented and what are the factors that impede or expedite their implementation. Then it is hard to determine if and how the process of implementation should be improved and democratised.
The aims of the paper will be to answer three research questions: (1) to what extent the recommendations of CAs are implemented, (2) what are the factors that impede or expedite their implementation and (3) which elements of design or implementation of the CAs could be improved in order to increase the chances that CAs’ recommendations will be implemented.
For this purpose I will analyse the process of implementation of recommendations of the first three Polish CAs that were organised in Gdansk in the years 2016-2018. First, the implementation will be analysed with the use of a desk research method.

0,"The world is currently entangled in the confluence of social, political, economic and ecological crises, and there is growing doubt that current systems of governance can cope or even survive. Democracies have been constrained to and by a narrow set of institutions and processes anchored in dominant forms of political organization and imagination (e.g. state-market nexus). Power inequalities provide strong foundations for the (re)production of many current ills in social, economic, and democratic life. In this context, what does deliberative democratic thinking have to offer to the task of sociopolitical reimagining and change? The advent of deliberative democracy as a field in the 1980s offered useful correctives to the field of participatory democracy – for example, a deeper understanding of the communicative fabric of the public sphere and public reasoning as a bridge-builder between streets and institutions. However, this paper explores whether deliberative democracy now needs a participatory corrective in order to retain its potential for political legitimation anchored in social change. For this purpose, we will review ongoing critiques levelled at deliberative articulations of democracy and put them in conversation with participatory ideas and practices, with a particular focus on power in/equalities and the political economy of democratic innovations.",University of Edinburgh,De Montfort University,,,,,,,University of Edinburgh,,Oliver Escobar,Adrian Bua,,,,,,,Oliver Escobar,,Democracy,Institutions,Political Participation,,,,,,Democratic innovations for change: Do we need a participatory corrective to deliberative hegemony?,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64126&EventID=185
0,"In opposition to the sedentary bias in migration research (namely the idea that immigrants settle once for all in a receiving country), the mobility paradigm asserts that ways of belonging, practices of citizenship, and social dynamics are shaped by entwined mobilities of persons, ideas, and policies crossing different geographical places and states borders. For mobility scholars, mobility (as non-sedentary and non-territorially fixed belongings) should be taken into consideration by citizenship regimes and therefore provide to migrants and mobile individuals some resources (not to say rights) to foster their political agency, representation and inclusion in context where they temporarily live but without having formal citizenship status. To capture these aspects, some political theorist have recently mobilized the concept of urban citizenship, which is praised for its potential to create “[…] a status of equality that is uniquely appropriate for cities as it can be shared by sedentary and mobile populations"" (Bauböck, 2020). ""City-zenship"" (De-Shalit 2018), therefore, seems to promote the diversity and inclusion of residents, whatever is their formal citizenship status. It remains controversial at best, whether the concept of urban citizenship captures some specific meanings, adding value to the classical theories of citizenship, hence strengthening democratic integration. This paper will critically assess whether it is justified to claim that urban citizenship strengthens the democratic integration in diverse societies, including also residents on mobility?

We will argue that answering this question requires us to offer a comprehensive understanding of the concept of urban citizenship. We will first identify minimum conditions of democratic integration in diverse societies. Secondly, we will critically engage with the existing arguments, showing that they remain insufficient to claim that urban citizenship strengthens democratic integration. Third step will offer a comprehensive conceptual map on urban citizenship that discusses its individuation and organizes it according to its practical and statuary understandings. The fourth step will identify the conditions under which it is justified to claim that urban citizenship enhances democratic integration, hence should complement national citizenship in diverse and mobile societies.",University of Geneva,University of Geneva,,,,,,,University of Geneva,,Matteo Gianni,Esma Baycan Herzog,,,,,,,Matteo Gianni,,Citizenship,Democracy,Integration,Political Theory,Immigration,,,,Democratic Integration in Mobile Societies: A Normative Assessment of Urban Citizenship,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64157&EventID=185
0,"How do citizens respond when their municipalities are merged into larger jurisdictions? Previous studies have found municipal mergers to have negative effects on internal political efficacy and political trust. These results have been interpreted as a causal impact of jurisdiction size. However, effects of municipal mergers are not necessarily only permanent size-effects; they may also be transitory reform-effects. Using a comprehensive dataset of four surveys conducted from 2001 to 2021 (n=17.000), we show that the negative effects of Danish municipal mergers in 2007 were transitory. While the municipal mergers did indeed have sizable short-term negative effects on citizens’ satisfaction with democracy, subjective perceptions of being well-informed and political trust, these effects have all but vanished 14 years after the reforms. These results suggest that rather than being an effect of jurisdiction size, the negative democratic effects of municipal mergers are transitory reform effects

0,"This paper explores the possibilities for democratic progress in an age that seems to be marked by democratic regressions, understood as the deliberate undoing of hard-fought political achievements that enable citizens to meaningfully exercise their public autonomy. The paper begins by observing that even the most dramatic cases of democratic regressions are ambivalent occurrences, inasmuch as they demonstrate that quite radical systemic changes are in principle feasible so long as the requisite political will exists. The paper argues that recognising this fact can both motivate and strategically instruct citizens who seek to oppose and reverse regressive trends on the ground. It can motivate them in the sense of generating hope that, just as particular democratic achievements have been deliberately undone through concerted political action, also the restoration of democratic standards – and possibly an even more thoroughgoing democratisation of society – can be achieved if democratically-minded citizens join forces. It can strategically instruct citizens because treating democratic regressions as the product of particular political actors’ intentional actions re-orients our focus to the crucially important question of which democratic norms those actors have transgressed when they launched their attack on democracy, and which of these norms democratically-minded citizens might rightfully transgress in their struggle for the re-democratisation of society as a matter of ‘democratic reciprocity’.

0,"Recent democratic theory is torn between diagnoses of doom and just as many approaches to salvation. Rescue proposals mostly refer to democratic innovations such as mini publics, to social movements, or global governance to achieve democratization. What is striking is that while all these proposals acknowledge growing social inequality, they are less materialistic in their solutions and rarely oriented toward precarious living conditions. For the most part, the focus remains on increased attention to public deliberation or better opportunities for participation, while the decline of basic material conditions of democracy is not addressed. The aim of this paper is to propose a pragmatist approach with John Dewey, who closely focused on the social foundations of democracy: Since capitalism undermines the possibility of growth of freedom, the socialization of infrastructure, large banks and companies is an appropriate means of creating an egalitarian society for him (1). This shows that democratic socialism can be understood as a pragmatist approach to the crises of liberal democracy (2). Turning to the problems of men is an appeal to democratic theory to stop vacillating between praise and decline, but to face concrete challenges. This paper aims to show that only concrete solutions to the problems of men as well as securing most basic materialist standards will safeguard democracy (3). Lastly, it will outline concrete institutional ideas that will help strengthening such standards of political and material equality (4).",Technische Universität Darmstadt,,,,,,,,Technische Universität Darmstadt,,Katharina Liesenberg,,,,,,,,Katharina Liesenberg,,Democracy,Political Theory,Social Justice,,,,,,Democratic Socialism as a pragmatic response to the crisis of liberal democracy,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65132&EventID=185

0,"Democratic innovations such as participatory budgetings and public debates are being more and more implemented in Italy. In some cases they have also been institutionalized through specific legislative interventions at the national, regional or local level. When it comes to the institutionalization of these practices, academia is usually divided. Some scholars believe that institutionalization can be a positive means to stabilize these experiences, so democratic innovations can become an ordinary governance tool; others see possible negative consequences in the institutionalization, for instance the risk that democratic innovations can be implemented in a more and more ritual and ceremonial manner, and the risk of an excessive institutional control over these practices. Important authors such as Luigi Bobbio think that democratic innovations have to be regulated. However, rules cannot simply be imposed by institutions wanting to institutionalize democratic innovations, but participants should also agree on them.  

A way to have possible participants agree on rules regulating democratic innovations can be found in what the Italian pertinent literature has already occasionally called meta-participation. Meta-participation occurs when participatory and deliberative tools (such as town meetings, open space technologies, on-line consultations) are used by the general population to deliberate over participation-related problems, in a legislative process where representative institutions have the last word. Meta-participation could be a way to democratize both the process leading to the institutionalization of democratic innovations and innovations themselves, because the process becomes open to contributions about democratic practices coming from the general population. Whether meta-participation actually works as an effective instrument to democratize the institutionalization process and democratic innovations, it actually depends on how inclusive the process is, and on the impact the results of the meta-participation have on the final decisions the representative institutions make. 

This paper will describe and compare, through the analysis of official documents provided by the involved institutions, three processes of meta-participation occurred in Italy. The first took place in Tuscany regarding the adoption of a regional law about public debate and the promotion of participatory practices. The second was implemented in the Metropolitan City of Bologna, concerning the adoption of the Statute which was destined to regulate, among the other fields, public participation as well. The last one took place in the City of Milan, again on the adoption of a municipal law destined to institutionalize participatory and deliberative practices.

The work will assess the pros and cons of these processes, particularly looking at how inclusive they were and at the impact they had on final decisions made by representative institutions. In this way, finally, the paper will try to establish some best practices regarding how meta-participation should (and should not) be implemented.",Università degli Studi di Genova,,,,,,,,Università degli Studi di Genova,,Domenico Andrea Schiuma,,,,,,,,Domenico Andrea Schiuma,,Civil Society,Democratisation,Institutions,Local Government,Political Participation,Decision Making,,,"Democratizing the institutionalization of democratic innovations through participation?

0,"Since March,11 2020 when the WHO declared COVID-19 virus a pandemic, the sociopolitical effects of the health crisis have been in the epicenter of social science research. One of the issues that have attracted significant attention within the scientific community, is that of compliance with mitigation measures, as the highly contagious nature of the virus and the powerlessness of the states to enforce lockdowns for long, rendered the voluntary adherence to preventive policies crucial for slowing the spread of the pandemic and reducing the casualties. Then again, while the study of compliance with COVID-19 mitigation measures has increased exponentially in the last two years, we know remarkably little about the factors that drive non-compliance with public health orders. At the same time, the limited research on the topic has identified noncompliers as either COVID-19 deniers, individuals that reject the mere existence of the virus; or as dissidents, who recognise mandatory restrictions as an attempt of the state to suppress their freedom and exercise control over their everyday life. However, there has not been any study to empirically test the different assumptions regarding noncompliers yet. In an attempt to fill this research laguna, we study the social and political factors that lead individuals to non-compliance through the use of a novel dataset from eleven European countries. Based on our cross-national survey, we find that non-compliers are characterised by a reactionary orientation, which is manifested as a cluster of co-occurring anti preferences regarding issues such as immigration, climate change, the role of science, and the EU integration; and therefore we identify reactionism – defined as the political attitude that combines resentful affectivity with a sense of injustice and a desire to return to the past – as a strong driver of non-compliance with COVID-19.",University of Birmingham,"GESIS, Leibniz","GESIS, Leibniz",,,,,,University of Birmingham,,Tereza Capelos,Sotirios Karampampas,Alexia Katsanidou,,,,,,Tereza Capelos,,Comparative Politics,Political Psychology,Euroscepticism,Political Engagement,Survey Research,,,,"Deniers, Dissidents or Something More?

0,"Several European States, including States located in Southern Europe, have recently amended their nationality legislation to introduce or extent the circumstances following which some categories of citizens can be deprived of their citizenship because of national security concerns. These legislative changes are, in main cases, justified by the need to fight against terrorism. As a result, in the last two
decades, deprivation of citizenship has been increasingly used as a mean to punish those condemned or, in some case, merely involved in terrorism. The consequences of this mechanism on the situation of the citizens concerned are significant as the exclusion from the national community can lead to the exclusion from the national territory. Deprivation of citizenship is not prohibited by the European legal framework. However, this sovereign power is still limited by respect for EU law and general principles. The objective of the present proposal is to examine the issues raised by the utilization of deprivation of citizenship as a response to national security concerns regarding and highlighting the limits set out
by the European legal framework and institutions. We will first identify the issues raised by deprivation of citizenship starting from the analysis of its applications in several European member States. In that context, we will demonstrate that, by making a link between the decision to revoke nationality and the loss of all residence status, European countries have turned it into an instrument for regulating migration based on criminal grounds. Secondly, we will interrogate the validity of deprivation of nationality as a response to national security concerns regarding the limits set out by the Europe legal framework and institutions.",Université catholique de Louvain,,,,,,,,Université catholique de Louvain,,Christelle Macq,,,,,,,,Christelle Macq,,Citizenship,European Politics,Institutions,Security,,,,,Deprivation of nationality in Europe: a security measure compatible with the European legal  framework?,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65399&EventID=185

Drawing on the case of the world’s first Global Assembly on the Climate and Ecological Emergency, this paper will foreground the lived experience of participants experiencing extreme hardship as they engage with expert testimonies, information booklets, wikis, and other forms of evidence. Understanding how the most disadvantaged participants experienced climate assemblies allows scholars and practitioners to critically examine taken-for-granted assumptions in mini-public design such as the time and resources assembly members have to go over information packets, qualities of a ‘suitable witness,’ the role of technology in conveying complex messages, as well as judgements about what counts as ‘fair’ and ‘diverse’ knowledge. Overall, this paper makes a case for examining climate assemblies from the perspective of their most disadvantaged participants, and, in so doing, generate actionable insights on how future assemblies can curate information that is sensitive to different forms of hardships participants experience that constrain their capacity for full participation.","Faculty of Business, Government and Law, University of Canberra",,,,,,,,"Faculty of Business, Government and Law, University of Canberra",,Nicole Curato,,,,,,,,Nicole Curato,,Democracy,Environmental Policy,Governance,Political Participation,International,Climate Change,,,Designing climate assemblies for the most disadvantaged,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64045&EventID=185
0,"The proposed paper presents the application of a multivariate methodological approach, following Hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) and Factorial Correspondence analysis (AFC) in two steps (Benzécri et al, 1973), in an attempt to investigate the inner correlations between political culture and political behavior. The aim of the study is to uncover the political cultural profiles in terms of the construction of the “political self” and the “moral self” (Taylor, 1991) and understand how these cultural discourses interact with other political behavior variables, such as political interest, political mobilization, and political information. To present and develop the method in this, this paper uses as an example the data analysis and results of a survey among the students of Aristotle Thessaloniki in spring 2019. To deal with the creation of cultural discourses we base our analysis on the method of symbolic representation, with the use of pictures which represent various concepts of specific terms such as “democracy” or” moral values” (Maragudakis and Chadjipadelis, 2019). The variables for the symbolic representation of the democratic self and the moral self are analyzed in the first step with HCA, producing clusters of pictures as well as clusters of the respondents. These new cluster membership variables (one for the democratic self and one for the moral self) are identified, so that we understand the profile of each cluster. Then in a second step of analysis these two cluster membership variables ae jointly analyzed with the rest of the political behavioral variables with AFC. Correspondence analysis, at this stage allows the reorganization of all categories upon several dimensions which describe the phenomenon (the overall inertia of the data) (Greenacre, 2007). The coordinates of the categories are clustered together, producing specific sets of categories of the variables of the analysis. These sets of characteristics reflect political culture discourses, followed by the political behavior characteristics that they are linked to. Following this method, the various behavioral and cultural discourses can be visualized further in a two-dimensional system where all categories are positioned on the axes according to their coefficients (Greenacre, 2010). The visualization in this behavioral map, not only makes the discourses distinctly visible and comprehensible, but in addition, we can understand further the inner antagonisms between the discourses by assessing their position on this cartesian field (discourses which are on the edges of on-axis or discourses which are close together on one side of a single axis).

0,"We are currently faced with some renewed global challenges and tensions, including the increase in migration, the climate emergency and the digital and technology-based era. Scholars argue that these challenges have brought new complexities into the field and efforts should be made to think about the conceptualisation of (youth) political attitudes, behaviours and participation (Pickard, 2019; Trevion & Carrasco, 2021). In line with this trend, the global challenges requires new shifts in education and learning systems. Global Citizenship Education is UNESCO’s response to the challenges and is formulated in target 4.7 in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) implemented by the United Nations: “by 2030, all learners should acquire the knowledge and skills needed to promote sustainable development, including, among others, through education for sustainable development and sustainable lifestyles, human rights, gender equality, promotion of a culture of peace and non-violence, global citizenship and appreciation of cultural diversity and of culture’s contribution to sustainable development” (United Nations, 2018). Global citizenship is generally used as an umbrella term for social, political, environmental and economic actions of globally minded individuals and communities on a worldwide scale (United Nations, 2014) and is seen as one of the key components of the 21st century competencies young people should adopt (Russell, 2016). Schools are seen as one of the most efficient ways to foster citizenship education competences such as democratic values and skills and tolerant attitudes (Maurissen et al., 2020; Parker, 2003; Sivenbring, 2019). Accordingly, citizenship education has often been implemented in the curriculum and schools are expected to contribute actively to students’ citizenship competences (Eurydice, 2017). Given the widespread importance of citizenship education and its changing rapidly over time (Veugelers, 2020), it is important to understand how teachers currently think and act in the classroom regarding the diversifying global issues. In contrast to the extended research of citizenship attitudes among pupils (Agirdag et al., 2011; Van Houtte & Stevens, 2009; Verkuyten & Thijs, 2002), less attention has been given to teachers and there is little agreement about how teachers aim at dealing with the aspects of a globalised world challenged by diverse political and social changes, such as ethnic and cultural diversity in classroom practices (Pullinx, 2017; Thijs & Verkuyten, 2014; Vedder et al., 2006). This study will focus on various teachers’ education efforts (practices) within the context of a diversifying global world. Data from a representative teacher survey in Belgium (Flanders) including a sample of 830 secondary school teachers will be used to answer this question. The survey developed for the study comprised questions on teachers’ attitudes and behaviours with regard to radicalisation and polarisation in the classroom, social media and fake news, and classroom dialogues on sensitive topics. Regression analysis models will be used to determine the variables (i.e. on the individual, class-and school-level) that affect teachers’ attitudes and behaviours. Our study contributes to the future perspective within citizenship education and implications important for research, policy and practice will be discussed.",University of Leuven,,,,,,,,University of Leuven,,Sari Verachtert,,,,,,,,Sari Verachtert,,Citizenship,Democracy,Globalisation,Education,Competence,,,,Determinants of teachers' global citizenship education practices in the classroom,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65625&EventID=185
0,"Recent years have been marked by a multiplication of justice-oriented climate activism across much of the world, including Fridays for the Future, school strikes, Green New Deal proposals and Extinction Rebellion. Demands for immediate action have been matched with a call for truth-telling about the scale and nature of the challenge. This sense that political leaders have failed to ‘tell the truth’ about climate change, and thus delayed and prevaricated on real action towards climate justice is shared by many academics. Many scholars aspire to deliver research that benefits activism. But measures of impact for research evaluation and funding purposes place little weight on the use of research by activists.  We consider what the challenges of climate justice activism might mean in this context for scholars, beyond being a target for calls for truth-telling. How can academics and academia effectively support and enable climate activism? Rather than turning to academic studies of activism, we sought to engage with activists to deliberatively explore how academia could best work with climate activism. We convened a series of online deliberative workshops involving both activists and academics from several European countries to create space for discussion, sharing of experiences and the development of proposals for the future. This short paper revisists the context for our work, then reports the process used and a set of principles (a ‘minifesta’) for academic-activist engagement that the group generated. It also reflects on three particular issues raised in these principles, and the discussions around them. First, the focus on inclusion and the extent to which it might lead to transformative change. Second implications regarding the role of activism and activists in collaborative processes.

0,"Development of organised interests in Slovenia stagnated during most of the 20th century. Reversal has taken place from the 1990s onwards, first with democratic transition and later on with the Europeanization processes. Several opportunity structures for the involvement of organised interests in policymaking have been established, while neo-corporatist arrangement enabled regular social dialogue. The main obstacle for further development of organised interests has remained its low-level professionalization. At the end of 2020 the political environment for activities of organised interests has still been quite favourable with some exceptions including decreases in public image and few political attacks on some NGOs. 

However, in the last two years several international reports on the quality of democracy (e.g. V-Dem, Nations in Transit, Bertelsmann index etc.) have shown decline of democracy scores for Slovenia. Cases of democratic backsliding have had effects also on activities and operation of organised interests. Considering forthcoming parliamentary elections in 2022, this article aims to analyse the effects of right-wing government on 1) democratic backsliding of Slovenian state, and in this respect 2) the role and position of organised interests in Slovenia. The case of Slovenia is relevant due to its moves in policymaking towards the politics of Visegrad countries, especially Hungary and Poland.

0,"The presentation will explore representations of European solidarity in the aftermath of crisis-like events between 2007 and 2017 in Croatian and Serbian broadsheet press, as well as their resonance with discursive construction of Europe and Europeanisation. In order to achieve this goal, corpus-based discourse analysis was performed over a large collection of ca. 20,000 articles, originating in four newspapers. The results demonstrated that discourses on European solidarity rose to particular prominence in 2008-2009, 2011-2013, and 2015. This constitutes a dialectical relation with discourses on crises: the global financial crisis, European debt crisis, and migration crisis – especially the latter redefined the notion of European solidarity reflected in Croatian and Serbian discourses.
In Serbia, the solidarity discourses were of particular local importance during the first phase of the global financial crisis, coinciding with the application for the EU candidacy. Using the ‘downloading’, ’uploading’, ’crossloading’ perspective on Europeanisation processes, this finding can be interpreted as an attempt to ‘upload’ Western discourses on solidarity with an agenda of financial aid for the candidate countries. Later on, they lost on significance, giving way to more ‘Euro-opportunist’ attitudes.
In Croatia, the notion of European solidarity seemed to become more relevant for domestic actors after the 2013 EU accession with progressive ‘downloading’ of the discourses employed by non-Croatian European leaders.",Jagiellonian University,,,,,,,,Jagiellonian University,,Piotr Mirocha,,,,,,,,Piotr Mirocha,,Europe (Central and Eastern),European Union,Critical Theory,Solidarity,,,,,Dialectics of European solidarity and crisis in Croatian and Serbian broadsheet press (2007–2017),https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65430&EventID=185

Extreme cases like Hungary and Poland suggest that populism in power transforms democracy into a competitive authoritarian system. However, the general extent to which populists affect the quality of democracy or even change the regime itself remains disputed (Art 2020). Seizing the concept of embedded democracy (Merkel 2004) and taking into account both legalistic and informal means, this paper offers a comparative assessment of the impact of populism on each partial regime of democracy. In doing so, we are able to, first, understand the means by which populists attempt to gain and solidify their power, level checks and balances and restrict constitutional guarantees of pluralism. This provides the basis to identify commonalities and differences among populist governments, offering an in-depth understanding of distinct impacts on democratic regimes.

0,"Studies of women's representation among elected officials have traced the “demand-side” mechanisms of selection, that are based on voters’ stereotypes concerning gender, personality traits, or areas of issue competence. Teele et al. (2018) proposed three mechanisms underlying candidate choice which potentially suppress descriptive representation of women: outright hostility (when voters express preferences against female candidates), double standards (when female candidates’ traits are judged differently than the same traits of the male counterparts), and double binds (when desirable candidate’s traits require more investment from women). In this study, we test whether these mechanisms are present at different tiers of government, as we observe significant differences in female representation between local and national politics. In a large candidate choice Conjoint experiment conducted in Poland, we compared the preferences toward candidates for the MPs, local councilors, and mayors. Our preliminary findings suggest that the voters’ valuations of important candidates’ traits are contingent upon the type of office (executive vs legislative) and level of government (local vs national), and can partly explain why there are systematically more women among councilors and MPs than among mayors.",University of Warsaw,,,,,,,,University of Warsaw,,Adam Gendzwill,,,,,,,,Adam Gendzwill,,Gender,Local Government,Representation,Candidate,Electoral Behaviour,Experimental Design,Voting Behaviour,,"Different Offices, Different Expectations?

0,"This paper conceptualizes the implementation of (quasi-)judicial decisions on environmental disputes in the European Union from a concept-structural perspective. It provides an integrated analytical framework which illustrates both the conceptual basis for comparing implementation processes in a variety of supranational disputes, as well as possible explanatory paths following a conjunctural logic. This approach considers the various structural, procedural, and context conditions at different levels of governance relevant to legal implementation. While legal frameworks at the national level are usually dense, European Union law implies its own unique implementation setting, which is highly relevant in environmental disputes, especially considering the high politics of climate change. First, existing research on the implementation of environmental decisions is discussed. Second, a concept-structural framework is developed to both theorize the implementation of decisions, and to provide an integrated analytical framework for further analysis. Finally, empirical examples are introduced to illustrate the viability of this approach.",Johann Wolfgang Goethe-Universität Frankfurt,,,,,,,,Johann Wolfgang Goethe-Universität Frankfurt,,Andreas Corcaci,,,,,,,,Andreas Corcaci,,Environmental Policy,Differentiation,Policy Implementation,,,,,,Differentiated implementation of decisions on environmental disputes in the European Union,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63559&EventID=185
0,"This paper investigates the salience of and the position on Differentiated integration (DI) for the Austrian government. The analysis is based on both an analysis of government programmes, programmatic government speeches and parliamentary debates between 2004 and 2019/20. It shows that DI is overall not a salient issue in Austria, at least with regard to general DI concepts and models. Specific instances of DI were, of course, subjects of intense debates but, with very few exceptions such as the financial transaction tax as an instance of enhanced cooperation, rarely discussed with specific reference to DI. Overall, most Austrian parties are also not generally in favour of DI, quite the opposite. The dominant vision of the EU is that of a community of closely cooperating Member States with the same rights and responsibilities where opt-outs are seen as cherry picking. Only one party has forcefully supported the development of a core Europe, namely the right-wing populist Bündnis Zukunft Österreich (Alliance for the Future of Austria, BZÖ). In this case, however, DI is mainly regarded as a means to exclude groups of Member States (especially the financially more vulnerable or net recipients) from areas of integration.","Institute for Advanced Studies, Vienna",,,,,,,,"Institute for Advanced Studies, Vienna",,Katrin Auel,,,,,,,,Katrin Auel,,European Union,Differentiation,Member States,,,,,,Differentiated Integration - Views from Austria,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=62285&EventID=185
0,"Neighbourhood policy governs the EU's relations with 16 of its southern and eastern neighbours. On 9 February 2021, 25 years after the Barcelona Declaration, the European Commission published a Joint Communication “Renewed partnership with Southern Neighbourhood – A new Agenda for the Mediterranean”.  It includes 5 strategic directions, which aimed to build sustainable long-lasting stable region with partnership countries. As the key policy areas had been pointed: Human development, good governance and the rule of law; Strengthen resilience, build prosperity and seize the digital transition; Peace and security; Migration and mobility; Green transition: climate resilience, energy, and environment. The strategic interaction between EU and non-member states creates space for the evaluation of the need for differentiated integration or even its impact. The EU with the ambition to strengthen strategic partnership with Mediterranean countries supply an excessive amount to support priority areas and policies in order to induce partnership countries to voluntarily adopt EU policies. The priorities in neighbourhood policy are alligned with principles stated in article 21 TEU, meantime also corresponds to the values common to EU member states as stated in the article 2 TEU. The EU conduct in supporting the effective policies’ implementation in Member states is rather focused on the enforcement, while in the ENP it is focused on strategic interaction and cooperation.  
We show the asymmetry of the EU approach based on the same values, in three areas: human rights and rule of law, migration and green transition and assess how the different legal regulation, policy strategies and instruments and allocated finances in EU Member states  and in ENP, especially in Mediterranean, support differentiated integration. We argue that EU is more likely to support non-member states in exchange for adopting EU rules as the Member states and this differentiated approach is contrary to integration model inside the EU, although it creates more space to be successful in external relations.","Faculty of Social and Economic Sciences, Comenius University","Faculty of Social and Economic Sciences, Comenius University",,,,,,,"Faculty of Social and Economic Sciences, Comenius University",,Lucia Mokra,Donald Wertlen,,,,,,,Lucia Mokra,,Democracy,European Union,Governance,Human Rights,Migration,Climate Change,Differentiation,Energy Policy,Differentiated integration and European Neighbourhood policy: the asymmetry supporting EU external action (?),https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=62606&EventID=185
0,"The concept of differentiated integration (DI) provides a way to talk about the accommodation of diversity in the EU. However, DI can also be perceived as a means to discriminate between the more economically advanced, typically older and Western EU Member States, and newer EU Member States. One of the EU countries that perceives DI as both an opportunity for deeper European integration and as a potential source of discrimination among the EU Member States, is Romania. To get a better understanding of successive Romanian governments’ approach to DI and of the salience that DI has in that country, this paper undertakes a quantitative and qualitative analysis of official communications and pronouncements made by Romanian decision-makers on the subject of EU integration between 2006-2020. My analysis indicates that there has been a relatively low salience of DI models (i.e. multi-speed and multi-end EU) and DI mechanisms (i.e. enhanced cooperation and opt- outs) but a high salience of DI instances (i.e. differentiated EU policies) in the official discourse emanating from Romanian government sources during this period. The position of successive Romanian governments with regard to DI was strongly in favour of more integration, especially when it comes to the country’s accession both to the Schengen area and to the Eurozone; however, successive governments have fervently opposed any type of DI models. This is explained in part by Romania’s majority pro-European electorate and decision-makers, and also by the desire of Romanian governments to be seen as existing on an equal footing with other EU Member States within the EU’s decision-making processes.",European University Institute,,,,,,,,European University Institute,,Claudia Badulescu,,,,,,,,Claudia Badulescu,,European Union,Differentiation,Member States,,,,,,Differentiated Integration or Discriminatory Integration?

0,"There is increasing interest in the significance of populism in foreign policy, with a growing literature focusing on the significance of populism itself, as distinct from the thick ideology it adheres to. For example left and right populist parties and actors are said to display a shared aversion to the transfer of sovereignty to ‘globalist elites’ beyond national borders, or to a US or Western dominated international order. They are also said to show a common tendency to centralise and personalise foreign policy processes. Yet scholarship on populism and foreign policy is complicated by competing approaches to conceptualising populism in general, and a consequent difficulty in categorising populist actors. A wide range of political leaders are categorised as populist. But are politicians as diverse as Donald Trump, Boris Johnson, Narendra Modi, Benjamin Netanyahu, and Victor Orban all populist in the same way, and with the same significance for foreign policy? 
I argue for two moves that will help us to make more nuanced analyses of the role of populism in foreign policy. First, we should complement existing approaches to studying populism with more interpretive methodologies that engage with the complexity of the world views and motivations of political actors, and the potential for those to change over time. Based on this approach we should resist the temptation to label political actors in binary terms as ‘populist’ or ‘not populist’ – with all the loaded implications in terms of legitimacy – and think in terms of degrees of populism that apply to parties or individuals. I argue that it is particularly important regarding international politics to differentiate between politicians that use populist rhetoric primarily for strategic ends, and those for whom populist ideas genuinely shape their ideology or world view. Second, we should take more explicit account of both domestic and international constraints on the office holder’s ability to bring a populist agenda to bear on a state’s foreign policy. Domestic constraints include the political structure of the state – system of government, checks and balances etc. – as well as the time the office holder has in power. International constraints refers to the room for manoeuvre a national government has in foreign policy, defined by their state’s relative power and position in the international system. 
These two moves enable us to position ‘populist’ political actors on two indices: the extent of their populist ideology, and the extent of their room for manoeuvre. A politician that scores high on both will have the greatest potential to revise their nation’s foreign policy and cause disruption in the international system. I will present how this framework may help us analyse and predict the foreign policy significance of  populism with respect to specific examples.",Bar Ilan University,,,,,,,,Bar Ilan University,,Toby Greene,,,,,,,,Toby Greene,,Comparative Politics,Foreign Policy,International Relations,Political Parties,Populism,Qualitative,,,Differentiating degrees and manifestations of populism in foreign policy,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65832&EventID=185
0,"Differentiated integration (DI) in the European Union has become a significant topic of interest for those scholars engaged in European integration. A great deal of literature on DI focuses on the evolution of differentiation as a response to crisis, as a means of compromise between the very different contexts of member states, and as a necessary component of enlargement. A frequent area of sub-text linking many of these studies is the suggestion of potential structural weakness; that DI as a process may portend vulnerabilities in the post-war consensus of a shared commitment to European integration, and that the remarkability of DI is precisely because of its contrast to a notion of linear progress toward an ever closer union. This paper takes a more neutral stance in assessing the degree of DI in the European Semester, for the purpose of ascertaining the utility of DI toward maintaining a cohesive macroeconomic convergence tool. Employing a dataset that captures all of the European Semester’s Country-Specific Recommendations (CSRs) from 2012-2019, the paper explores the form and content of CSRs to offer an overview of the strengths and weaknesses of DI in the EU’s macroeconomic arena. The tentative findings are that the highly tailored prescriptions within the CSRs illustrate the utility of DI towards maintaining a cohesive economic union.",University of Victoria,University of Victoria,,,,,,,University of Victoria,,Valerie D'Erman,Amy Verdun,,,,,,,Valerie D'Erman,,European Union,Integration,Differentiation,Eurozone,,,,,Differentiation and the European Semester – an examination of country specific recommendations,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=62276&EventID=185
0,"From the 2015 migration crisis up to the 2021 border crisis with Belarus, migration has become a growing subject of concern in Poland. In the wake of crises, the frontier in discourse between “war refugees” and “economic migrants” became extremely thin, with an increased negative depiction of both refugees and migrants. Furthermore, migration has been considerably politicised and mediatised in Poland, and has been increasingly discussed in relation to other issues, notably the development of European integration. Migration has been one basis for questioning the current role and functioning of the EU. Against this backdrop, this research investigates discourse on migration in Poland with regard to the differentiating process and boundary-setting against migrants, as well as Poland’s relation with the EU. It explores differentiation as a process through which differences between migration statuses are constructed in discourse and translated in political claims regarding who should be – or not – welcome on the national territory. This discursive selection in migration eventually relates to Europe and its future – i.e., the EU’s role but also Poland’s place within it. Based on a qualitative analysis of parliamentary debates on migration hold in the Polish parliament from 2015 to 2021, this research aims at shedding light on Polish discourse on migration in relation to European integration. In this respect, it reflects on the differential inclusion of migrants, the future of the EU and Poland’s self-pictured role in Europe facing migration.",Jagiellonian University,,,,,,,,Jagiellonian University,,Elodie Thevenin,,,,,,,,Elodie Thevenin,,European Politics,European Union,Migration,Parliaments,Euroscepticism,,,,Differentiation of Migrants and the Future of Europe.

How do environmental protectionism and climate change policies impact on electoral politics? Offering one of the first comprehensive comparative studies of how climate change policies might affect voting behaviour, this article argues that local opposition to specific climate change measures is key to understanding the emergence of a rural- urban cleavage in Western Europe. Using the European Social Survey’s (ESS) Module “Public Attitudes to Climate Change” and the Eurobarometer 91.5 we develop and test a range of hypotheses about the ways in which local and concentrated resistance to climate change measures may be channelled into electoral behaviour. Specifically, we theorise climate change as a collective action problem with diffuse benefits and concentrated costs. Climate policies can impose costs on local communities and socially defined groups through job losses, regressive income effects and negative externalities thus fuelling localised opposition from those areas that are incurring these costs. This, in turn, feeds into voting behaviour, reinforcing territorial cleavages and potentially leading to accountability failures or the rise of populist parties. We apply a series of multilevel logit models to inspect how climate concerns have affected voting in National Elections by 2016 and the 2019 European Parliament Elections. Our results support our argument that backlash against environmental protectionism is triggered at the local level by the potential ‘losers’ of these processes. This backlash is key to understanding emerging centre-periphery divides and new political alliances where populist right-wing parties increasingly align with the periphery and the country-side and green parties with the metropolitan centres as witnessed in the elections we cover in our dataset. Hence, the division between far right and greens parties has also increasingly built up a geographical anchor. Our argument highlights the importance of green attitudes for the emergence of societal cleavages and has significant policy implications. To be politically successful, environmental policies need to align private and social benefits. If we are right, the consequences of local resistance can be detrimental for political stability.",University of Reading,University of Reading,,,,,,,University of Reading,,Christoph Arndt,Daphne Halikiopoulou,,,,,,,Christoph Arndt,,Comparative Politics,Environmental Policy,Political Parties,Climate Change,Electoral Behaviour,Public Opinion,Energy Policy,,Diffuse benefits and concentrated costs: how local opposition to environmental protectionism is fuelling a new centre-periphery divide in Western Europe,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64189&EventID=185
0,"A variety of public, governmental initiatives inform citizens about what is considered ‘healthy’, ‘climate friendly’, and in general ‘sustainable’ food. The ambition is to influence individual food choices. However, research also suggests that, rather than public authorities, people are more likely to influence each other’s behaviour. Yet, the degree of influence seems to depend on how people are connected and how similar they are to each other. To better understand the various dynamics occurring within social networks, researchers have experimented with controlled networks, manipulating factors like the number or kinds of ties. This increases the chances of identifying causality, yet also affects the external validity of the results since the design is very artificial. The paper outlines a 4-month randomized controlled trial that tries to minimise artificiality by studying real-life behaviour, while including controlled treatments. Specifically, using a mobile application, we will study if and how real-life, self-reported intakes of plant- and animal-based foods diffuse under certain social network conditions. The participants are randomly assigned to distinct networks, each exposed to different signals. One aim is to compare whether behavioural change spreads more (if at all) in groups exposed to (1) different social network conditions (interaction possibilities by sharing pictures, likings, and comments) and (2) different source-types of information about food (fact-based versus social group-based). By investigating the roles of both social diffusion processes and certain structural conditions provided by public actors for sustainable consumption, the results contribute to discussions of how and by whom effective and efficient measures could be implemented to ease and foster sustainable consumption.",University of Örebro,University of Örebro,Uppsala Universitet,,,,,,University of Örebro,,Carolin Zorell,Ansung Kim,Nicklas Neuman,,,,,,Carolin Zorell,,Environmental Policy,Institutions,Experimental Design,,,,,,Diffusion of eating behaviour in different social networks: A randomized controlled trial,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64965&EventID=185

These elections constituted the fourth electoral round within two years period (April 2019 – March 2021) due to a political deadlock and inability to maintain a long-lasting government on account of PM Netanyahu’s indictment. Both politicians and citizens were already weary of the ballots’ fever. Additionally, the campaign that had lasted 100 days (December 2020 – March 2021) took place within the COVID-19 pandemic crisis. During these months Israel went from a severe third lockdown; the longest of all to stepping out of the Corona due to a very successful vaccination operation. During these months I have closely monitored the online campaigns of all political actors, mostly via social websites and media coverage.

d.	Youth, and children. 
4.	The web as frontier-less space - one of the outcomes of campaigning on less central media platforms is a blatant disregard for electoral and general laws that slips under the public radar and represents the state’s incapacity to enforce its laws on political actors during electoral campaign.

0,"The 2021 German federal election campaign offers a unique setting to investigate the impact of digital campaigning on the election result. Our analysis starts from the observation that the pandemic forced all parties alike to drastically reduce their campaign efforts involving personal interaction and resort to digital campaigning instead. However, parties are likely to differ substantially as regards a) their ability to run online campaigns (the supply side) and b) the receptiveness of their target electorates (the demand side) to such campaign efforts. Therefore, we ask: Which candidates have benefited the most from digital campaigning?

In recent years, an increase in social media use by German politicians can be observed, with politicians from different parties communicating differently. Regarding the supply side, politicians of minor parties tend to use new digital tools more intensively to compensate for the lower media coverage they receive (equalisation thesis). Moreover, politicians consider the demand side in their communication: They develop perceptions of what kind of communication their followers might expect and consider these perceptions in their social media communication (perceived audience expectations). 

Given that Greens and FDP have a substantially younger membership with higher expectations of politicians’ social media communication, we expect these two parties to be particularly well-placed to run effective online campaigns and meet a receptive target electorate. In addition, the AfD has always been very active in the digital sphere because it needed to circumvent the low level of coverage by conventional media. 

Yet few studies examine how candidates’ social media activities are related to their election results. Therefore, we will use the GLES candidate surveys – in particular the 2021st survey – to measure a wide range of digital campaign activities of constituency candidates and estimate its effect on electoral returns at the constituency level. As we know that not all candidates have answered the candidate survey, we will cross-validate this analysis with our own data set covering the Twitter activities of all Bundestag candidates of parties that are represented in the 20th Bundestag.

In a nutshell, our main argument is that the enforced push towards digital campaigning has benefitted some parties more than others, and we will test this assertion at the constituency level, which will permit a very fine-grained analysis.",Heinrich-Heine-Universität Düsseldorf,Heinrich-Heine-Universität Düsseldorf,Heinrich-Heine-Universität Düsseldorf,Heinrich-Heine-Universität Düsseldorf,,,,,Heinrich-Heine-Universität Düsseldorf,,Michael Angenendt,Ole Kelm,Thomas Poguntke,Ulrich Rosar,,,,,Michael Angenendt,,Political Competition,Political Parties,Campaign,Social Media,Electoral Behaviour,,,,Digital Campaigning: Who Benefits?

We provide a description of parties’ digital strategies, considering how they develop digital tools and strategies internally (‘in-house’ in the party organisational centre and within decentralized political party structures) and externally, drawing on the supporting actors identified by Dommett et al. Our empirical data draws on semi-structured interviews and documentary data which goes beyond campaigning periods to consider parties’ ordinary and ongoing digital ecosystems. Building upon this rich comparative material, we then try to understand why specific digital strategies and structures are employed. We consider why digital tools, strategy and capacity might differ across these parties, particularly considering parties’ roles in government/opposition and their ideological positioning. We argue that both of these factors are crucial as they provide material and ideational resources which spur and shape parties’ investment in digital tools and methods. However, we consider that regionalist parties, across these variables may be likely to invest in such tools as a way of providing direct access to voters and members (beyond official state or media means) and due to the relatively small and flexible size of party organisations.",University of Valencia,University of Birmingham,,,,,,,University of Valencia,,Oscar Barberà,Judith Sijstermans,,,,,,,Oscar Barberà,,Cyber Politics,Political Parties,Campaign,Internet,Social Media,Communication,,,Digital ecosystems in regionalist parties,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64273&EventID=185

0,"In my presentation, I address the association of perceptions of individual and group relative deprivation, internal and external political efficacy with voting for parties with populist rhetoric. My contribution is threefold. First, even though the effect of perceptions of relative deprivation on populism has been addressed in literature (e.g., Gidron & Hall, 2016, Elchardus & Spruyt, 2016), there is no evidence whether individual or group-level perceptions of relative deprivation relate more to populism. Second, I contribute by adding political efficacy to the model. Internal political efficacy provides individuals with a feeling that they can make a positive influence on their disadvantaged situation. However, the results on its relation to populism are controversial (e.g., Rico et al., 2020; Lytkina & Reeskens, 2022). External political efficacy stands for the responsiveness of the political system and has been found to strongly relate to populism (e.g., Geurkink et al., 2020). Third, I check whether the proposed mechanism replicates across different European societies. To do so, I perform multilevel analysis for 25 European countries using the European Social Survey (Round 9, 2018) data with imputed scores of populist rhetoric taken from the Chapel Hill Expert Survey (2014, 2017, 2019). I found that both, perceptions of individual and group relative deprivation, positively relate to voting for parties which employ populist rhetoric. External political efficacy negatively relates to support for parties using populist rhetoric, and internal political efficacy is associated with a higher level of support for parties employing populist rhetoric. At the country level, people are more likely to vote for parties employing populist rhetoric if populist parties are in government. Additionally, affluence at the country level relates to lower support for parties with anti-elitist rhetoric; however, this effect is less prominent among people perceiving individual or group-level relative deprivation.",Universität Bremen,,,,,,,,Universität Bremen,,Ekaterina Lytkina,,,,,,,,Ekaterina Lytkina,,Europe (Central and Eastern),Political Psychology,Populism,Social Justice,Comparative Perspective,,,,Disadvantaged and Powerless or Resentful and Empowered: What Makes People Vote for Parties with Populist Rhetoric?,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65904&EventID=185
0,"This paper engages with the section theme by considering how knowledge ‘travels’ or is ‘diffused’ around the globe. The ideas in Everett M. Rogers’ (1962) seminal book Diffusion of Innovations were influential in explaining how, why, and at what rate new ideas diffuse. Rogers argues that diffusion is the process whereby an innovation is communicated over time among the participants in a social system. Following and related to this is the diffusion of policyinnovations, where innovations are any policy idea that has not been previously adopted by a government unit (Walker, 1969). The concept of policy diffusion considers the mechanisms which account for how policies in one unit (e.g. country, state) are influenced by the prior policy choices of other units. Models of policy innovation share many commonalities with models that seek to explain organisational innovation more widely. In recent years, the concept has received increased attention in the political science literature (see Berry and Berry, 2018; Gilardi and Wasserfallen, 2019; Blatter et al., 2021; Mallinson, 2021; Kuhlmann, 2021). These studies offer conceptual refinement and greater clarity of the various pathways of policy diffusion. We can also see how policy diffusion is increasingly international, taking place between different countries, sometimes mediated by international organisations or private actors. These developments provide a timely opportunity to assess the potential value of this literature to higher education.

This paper contributes to the focus of the panel by identifying the national manifestations of policy imperatives that have diffused internationally. Specifically, we can see universities are being subject to new forms of government intervention as nation states respond to the policies pursued in other territories. For example, we can see how a range of countries have restructured their higher education sector to make it more visible and competitive on the world stage. Recently, in the name of national security, many nations have followed the US in introducing much tighter export controls on research to prevent rivals or adversaries from acquiring it, and have stepped up surveillance to counter on-campus espionage. Moreover, as the ‘culture wars’ have spread around the world and spilled over onto campus, many governments have legislated to protect free speech which is perceived to be under threat.  
 
Policy examples such as these not only highlight the wider political dynamics underlying higher education policies, but also show how policy interventions can be a response to the policy choices of peer nations. We can also see how there can be a global diffusion of policy problems as well as policy solutions; i.e., countries see the same problems as their peers and then seek to address them using similar policy interventions. Hence, innovations are diffused in both higher education policy and practice— which accounts for the growing convergence between nations. The paper concludes by considering to what extent diffusion of innovation theories can help organise our thoughts, and structure future research, on knowledge politics and policies.",University of Manchester,,,,,,,,University of Manchester,,Andrew Gunn,,,,,,,,Andrew Gunn,,Governance,Public Policy,Higher Education,,,,,,Disaggregating the Diffusion of Innovations in Higher Education,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63580&EventID=185
0,"Recent changes in young people’s politics, notably their apparent transfer of adherence from duty-based (e.g. electoral politics) and traditionally passive norms (e.g. following the laws) of good citizenship have left many worried about the state of democratic citizenship. This issue is exasperated by the increasing presence of engaged norms of good citizenship (e.g. protests), which usually do not adhere to the institutional and collective structures of much of the political systems in place across Europe, including Scandinavia. We argue that some of these trends could be unpacked further by zooming in on the role of conflictual self-efficacy. Understanding conflictual self-efficacy as individuals’ evaluations of their own capabilities to master political disagreement, we expect it shape youth’s different norms of good citizenship distinctively, thus effecting their civic preparedness considerably. We assess how conflictual self-efficacy affects different norms, notably passive, active and engaged norms, and compare the relationship between these issues across three countries in Scandinavia, namely Denmark, Norway and Sweden via a series of multivariate analyses of the International Civic and Citizenship Study 2016 dataset.

0,"How are far-right actors embedded in discourse networks and how do they influence political contestation? Previous research shows that far-right actors are central actors in political conflicts in Western Europe, partly due to their dominance on contested issues such as migration. Within political conflicts, influence largely depends on actors’ political networks. Yet, we still lack an understanding of networks of far-right actors in public debates, and how they interact within these networks and across issues and critical events. To this end, we investigate the evolution and structure of discourse networks of far-right actors, their linkages with political elites, and the diffusion of their claims on issues of nationalism, Islam, and migration. We apply a multimethod approach to investigate actor-actor and actor-issue relations. First, combining multimodal network analysis with automated text analysis, we analyze networks of far-right actors in mass media (different newspapers) in Germany since 1990 in order to understand long-term dynamics. Second, based on relational content analysis, we focus on social media platforms of far-right actors and study contentious episodes after critical moments since 2016 to further understand their ideological linkages and relationship to issues of nationalism, Islam, and migration. This relational approach allows us to identify how far right actors are connected and able to speak, introduce, amplify, and maintain issues and shape public contestation not only at critical moments but also in the long-term. This demonstrates how political networks and discursive opportunities of far-right actors have changed and influenced political contestation over time.",WZB Berlin Social Science Center,,,,,,,,WZB Berlin Social Science Center,,Teresa Völker,,,,,,,,Teresa Völker,,Media,Migration,Social Media,Mixed Methods,Narratives,Political Engagement,,,Discourse Networks and Discursive Opportunities of the Far-Right,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63688&EventID=185

0,"Political culture and understandings of democracy

A common interpretation of rising concerns about the decline of democratic legitimacy is that citizens in established democracies have been losing their faith in the efficiency of the current political system in dealing with the recent economic, social, and political challenges. Thus, this discontent has been connected to the sharply rising success of the populist and extremist political actors at the ballot box. Drawing on the Silent Revolution in Reverse by Inglehart (2018), an effect of the recent economic and immigration crises and democratic backsliding is believed to shape the socioeconomic context of countries significantly and thus differently affect citizens' attitudes towards government, own communities, and incoming migrants. Still, the effects of crises and rehabilitation efforts differ across countries, and cross-national comparisons of how each of these hardships determines political behavior over time have been rarely examined in the literature. This paper, therefore, argues that weakening political support for the incumbent government is due to an interplay between diverging individual perceptions of socioeconomic deprivation and contextual realities themselves rather than universally construed as a lack of substantial improvements in the post-crisis periods. 

This study examines the political culture of citizens through the gap between young and older individuals' engagement with electoral politics in 26 European countries using the European Social Survey data between 2008 and 2018. Specifically, this study addresses the questions of (1) what context-related factors determine the age gap in voting between old and young citizens and (2) why the age gap in voting is smaller in some countries than in others. The results show that the age gap varies considerably across countries. The OLS and FE regressions results suggest that government expenditure, the share of migrants, and the age of democracy influence the level of age gap in voting. The findings raise fresh concerns about citizens’ perceptions of socioeconomic realities and democratic quality, and furthermore suggest improvements in the operationalization of macroeconomic and immigration proxies and also contribute to the comparative study on the democratic deficit.",Universidad de Deusto,,,,,,,,Universidad de Deusto,,Ayauzhan Kamatayeva,,,,,,,,Ayauzhan Kamatayeva,,Comparative Politics,Democracy,Political Participation,Global,Public Opinion,Political Cultures,,,Disentangling how the recent global challenges and individual perceptions of them shape political behaviour,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65909&EventID=185
0,"The Covid-19 pandemic shows once again: policies addressing and affecting human migration and mobility both explicitly and implicitly are inherently and mutually intertwined. Simultaneously, the effects and effectiveness of migration policies are influenced by a multitude of other public policies including healthcare, welfare, labour, economic or foreign policies. While acknowledging the interconnected nature of migration policy and governance systems, scholars have rarely tried to analyze whether and how multiple migration-relevant policies co-evolve in a systematic and coordinated way. 
This paper aims to fill this gap by asking whether internal and external migration-relevant policies develop in similar directions in terms of their restrictiveness, and, to what extent various migration-relevant policy instruments describe patterns of policy convergence or divergence?  
The analysis of migration policy configurations in and across 31 European states between 1990 and 2020 shows that the European migration policy mix is a configuration of policies that seem to develop rather independently from each other in rather incoherent directions – both within as well as between European destination countries. Yet a closer analysis identifies some striking patterns of convergence and co-evolution of some ‘functionally proximate’ policy areas while more ‘functionally distant‘ policies seem less integrated or coordinated. That is, despite efforts for greater harmonisation in some policy areas or some policy instruments, the broader European ‘migration policy regime’ is still rather fragmented, and a multitude of migration-relevant policies follow only weakly a policy coherent trend within and across Europe states.",Danube University Krems,University of Vienna,Danube University Krems,,,,,,University of Vienna,,Mathias Czaika,Federica Zardo,Heidrun Bohnet,,,,,,Federica Zardo,,Europe (Central and Eastern),Migration,Policy Analysis,Policy Change,,,,,Disentangling the European Migration Policy-Mix since 1990,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64922&EventID=185
0,"Affective polarisation is on the rise in a number of democracies, yet empirical evidence concerning its consequences remains limited at best. Excessive hostility is presumed to threaten democratic norms of compromise, co-operation, and deliberation, and perhaps even pave the way towards political violence. We argue that in order to understand the consequences of affective polarisation, we first need to disentangle the negative emotions captured by feeling thermometers. In the present study, we identify three behavioural tendencies – avoidance, intolerance, and support for violence – that affectively polarised citizens might engage in. We theorise that different discrete emotional responses – obscured by current thermometer measures – will lead to different consequences downstream. Specifically, we expect citizens that experience fear in response to outparty supporters to be more prone to avoidance behaviours, whilst disgust will lead to intolerance and anger to support for violence. 

 

These expectations are tested using a unique cross-national survey experiment, that includes a stimulus designed to exogenously activate or dampen affective polarisation. Due to be fielded in February 2022, we test these assumptions in nine countries – Brazil, the US, the UK, Germany, Poland, Italy, France, Spain and Sweden. Case selection accounts not only for variation in political system, but also levels of affective polarisation and the strength of partisan ties (or negative partisanship, as in the case of Brazil). Our results will contribute to the emerging literature as attention shifts from treating affective polarisation as a dependent variable, to instead viewing it as the independent variable.",University of Amsterdam,,,,,,,,University of Amsterdam,,Haylee Kelsall,,,,,,,,Haylee Kelsall,,Political Psychology,Political Violence,Quantitative,Electoral Behaviour,Public Opinion,Survey Experiments,,,"Disentangling the hostility: Affective polarization, discrete emotions and their social consequences",https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65553&EventID=185
0,"With over 6 million emigrants, the Venezuelan exodus is the second largest and fastest escalating displacement scenario in the world. Policy reactions in Latin American countries, which host the lion share of Venezuelan citizens, pose two intriguing research puzzles. First, countries governed conservatively were much more welcoming towards Venezuelan migrants and refugees than their left of center counterparts. This puzzle becomes even more salient when considering that leftist governments across Latin America initiated the liberalization of immigration and refugee laws and policies of the 2000s. Second, Colombia - the country that hosts the largest Venezuelan population – has been amongst the most generous in its efforts to regularize and protect Venezuelans. Based on 48 elite interviews in Colombia, Ecuador and Peru, this paper analyzes the determinants of political reactions to Venezuelan immigration. We argue that international relations originally trumped domestic concerns and led to framing Venezuelan displacement as a humanitarian crisis. We then throw light on the critical junctures at which domestic concerns took over foreign policy considerations, and Venezuelan displacement was reframed as a domestic security crisis in each of the three countries.","Universidad del Pacífico, Lima",WZB Berlin Social Science Center,,,,,,,WZB Berlin Social Science Center,"Universidad del Pacífico, Lima",Luisa Feline Freier,Nieves Fernández Rodríguez,,,,,,,Nieves Fernández Rodríguez,Luisa Feline Freier,International Relations,Latin America,Migration,Policy Analysis,Asylum,Domestic Politics,,,"Displacement, ""Crises"" & Critical Junctures:  Regional Reactions to Venezuelan Forced Displacement",https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64919&EventID=185
0,"Successful protest movements often depend on their ability to sway public opinion. Those who can promote their preferred discourse and make it acceptable to mainstream audiences gain an advantage in achieving their aims (Kilgo & Harlow, 2019). 

One lens this process may be viewed via is the so-called “incivility crisis” of Western politics, with the public demonstrating a dissatisfaction with politics that do not conform to the arbitrary standard of propriety. However, Foucauldian discourse theory suggests that dominant ideas are created and maintained by those in power, allowing them not only power over discourse but also power over definition of boundaries and terms of what is to be considered civil. This invalidates anyone whose politics aren’t performed to the state’s standards. 

What this means for day-to-day interactions between the public and movements is that how we perceive protestors is fundamentally shaped by the power structures surrounding us, with those who conform to the goals of the state more likely to be perceived as “good” (e.g. peaceful/righteous/worthwhile), and those that oppose the state perceived as “bad” (e.g. violent/undemocratic/pointless) (Chenoweth & Pressman, 2020; Hsiao & Radnitz, 2021). This means that certain voices may be automatically more marginalised than others, leaving these groups with few, if any, avenues for acceptable political participation, regardless of the validity of their aims (Maisel, 2012, p.407). Examples of this can be found in the suffragette, civil, and gay rights movements, all of which were once viewed as uncivil but are lauded now (Braunstein, 2018, p.622; Sugrue, 2018). If certain voices cannot participate on the state’s terms of civility, alternative forms of participation must be used. This paper, then, asks to what extent political vandalism is an acceptable substitute under these constraints. Ultimately, I conclude that political vandalism aligns with the theory of the passionate economist protestor, and that it can be a purposeful act that works towards creating better democracy, using the case study of the “Colston Four” to demonstrate the logic behind property destruction to restore equity (van Zomeren, Leach & Spears, 2012, p.193).

The example of the toppling of the Colston statue provides a case study via which to explore this theory, as it centres on an extremely contentious form of political expression: vandalism and property damage. This paper follows the contention surrounding the statue and the ways in which its destruction was received, and looks at how theory surrounding vandalism, civility, and discourse creation can be seen in both the viewpoints of the vandals and their critics. From this, I present a threefold justification for political vandalism, discussing the notion of property destruction as a means to restoring equity, a calculated strategy to cause disruption and create a seat at the table, and an emotional response to events. This draws upon discourse theory, the idea of the parrhesiast as an essential political voice, and Sparks’ idea of the “dissident citizen” to present a new understanding of what constitutes “good citizenship” and effective participation in the face of perceived failings of democracy (Sparks, 1997).",University of Liverpool,,,,,,,,University of Liverpool,,Rachel Brock,,,,,,,,Rachel Brock,,Contentious Politics,Democracy,Extremism,Social Movements,Protests,Activism,Theoretical,,Distractions or direct actions?

0,"Our research paper intends to tackle the question, how the technological development poses a challenge for experts to comprehend and test each others' professional knowledge, already specialised and differentiated from each other so distantly that - according to our hypothesis - a mutual trust among professions can be increasingly difficultly to achieve. This mutual trust was earlier the outcome of a common cognitive basis of different vocations, thanks to which physicians, physicists, engineers or biologists could understand and validate each others’ professional results. A lightning bulb, a successful surgery, or a running automobile was more than authentic and trustworthy evidence for the general functionality of specific knowledge, contributing to the Durkheimian ‘organic solidarity’ within representatives of different professions. The sphere of these experts – serving on an ‘in-between’ level below political decision-makers and above technical or administrative staff – can be called as ‘technostructure’, coined by John Kenneth Galbraith in a slightly different meaning, focusing solely on the business sphere and on corporative structures. Present research intends to broaden its denotation a bit, covering the totality of white-coller workers with specialized expertise within national economies as a whole. According to present research paper’s hypothesis, technological development – meanwhile enabling to explore the outer space or operate in the nano-world – has been partially undermining the common cognitive basis within this technostructure, therefore mutual trust and solidarity has been on the decline. The hypothesis has been tested with a survey among university students of ecological, economic and medical studies, who have to declare their own personal opinions about each others’ professions. These educational strands were chosen as being the cognitive basis for tackling climate crisis, financial crises and COVID crisis respectively. The survey among students has to reveal how specialised information about these crises – and proposals for their treatment – is accepted or neglected, or even denied by others.",Corvinus University of Budapest,,,,,,,,Corvinus University of Budapest,,István Kollai,,,,,,,,István Kollai,,Populism,Social Capital,Knowledge,Climate Change,Solidarity,Survey Research,Technology,,Distrust in Crisis: The Elimination of the Common Cognitive Basis of Technostructure in the 21st Century,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63328&EventID=185
0,"Some theories consider the media as the main forum of democratic discussions, the arena of information exchange and orientation on various policy issues. Thus, theoretically, media sources provide appropriate materials for careful information seeking, allowing individuals to formulate considerate opinions and attitudes. However, the trends in polarization of public debates and media contents create serious burdens to these assumptions. Individuals are most likely obsessed with media channels that reflect their views and ideologies, and thus more frequent media consumption will not result in moderate opinions, but the contrary, it will only strengthen the original opinion of individuals. Do diverse media contents and public discourses still convey a deliberative function, namely, can they mitigate opinion differences and support public consensus?
Media discourse and attitudes on immigration belong to the most politicized and polarized policy topics in Hungary, and therefore, provide a suitable research case to study the deliberative functions of the media and opinion exchange. Consequently, this research investigates how cross-cutting media frames and debates might influence immigration attitudes among Hungarian respondents. The research question is tested with focus group discussions, conducted during the most intensive period of the 2022 legislative campaign. Two sorts of groups are examined: homogenous and heterogenous groups from the point of view of participants' party preferences (i.e. government or opposition supporters). Participants read typical articles that present the immigration issue from various political approaches, then discuss their views on the topic. Relying on the suggestions of the affective intelligence theory, the research assumes mitigation of opinion differences in heterogenous groups, and further distancing of opinions in homogenous groups.",Central European University,,,,,,,,Central European University,,Eszter Farkas,,,,,,,,Eszter Farkas,,Media,Immigration,Qualitative Comparative Analysis,Communication,,,,,Diverse media consumption as an (un)effective form of deliberation?,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63571&EventID=185
0,"Not all social groups and social positions are represented in key decision-making positions in German society. The elite club continues to be a predominantly white, male, and non-migrant circle – with differences across sectors. Although between one quarter and one-fifth of the German population share (direct or indirect) migration experiences, they only make up to five percent of the German elite (Vogel and Zajak 2019). But how is the underrepresentation of migrants perceived and evaluated in the general population? And what effects does the underrepresentation have on the specific group, people with migration backgrounds? We use data from a quantitative population survey (N=388) to measure the perception of the lack of descriptive representation of migrants in elite positions and to investigate the implications of underrepresentation on attitudes of the underrepresented group on democracy. Following insights from previous studies, we expect that social groups which feel underrepresented in key decision-making positions are also less satisfied with democracy, the integration process, and societal institutions in general.
We show that most citizens (correctly) perceive the underrepresentation of migrants in elite positions and see that as problematic. But contrary to our expectations, we find that although migrants are underrepresented, there is no general effect of having a migrant background on attitudes on democracy. In specific, we neither observe a reduction in satisfaction with democracy and the integration process, nor in the trust in institutions for individuals with a migrant background. However, taking a closer look at the category “people with a migration background”, we do find differences between first- and second-generation migrants: Individuals who migrated to Germany themselves (first generation), overall show higher levels of satisfaction with democracy, the integration process, and trust in institutions. Interestingly, the democratic attitudes of those individuals whose parents migrated to Germany (second generation), do not significantly differ from Germans without migration experiences and show less satisfaction with democracy.
This indicates that while underrepresentation of social groups is considered a general problem for a democratic society (by the population and by people with a migration background), it does not necessarily affect the democratic attitudes of those being underrepresented (especially first-generation migrants). This might suggest that it takes time to feel entitled to be represented. Persons that have experienced migration might do not even expect to be represented in elite positions - in contrast to their descendants.",German Institute for Integration and Migration Research (DeZIM),Deutsches Zentrum für Integrations- und Migrationsforschung (DeZIM) e.V.,Johannes Gutenberg-Universität Mainz,,,,,,German Institute for Integration and Migration Research (DeZIM),,Sabrina Zajak,Kathleen Heft,Fabio Best,,,,,,Sabrina Zajak,,Democracy,Elites,Integration,Migration,Representation,Quantitative,Survey Research,,Diverse or not diverse?

0,"This paper contributes to an already flourishing literature on diversity in general (Bührmann 2020) and diversity in civil society more specifically (von Unger, Baykara-Krumme, Kerakayali, Schönwälder 2022) that is spurred by the continuously growing socio-cultural heterogeneity in Germany (Foroutan 2019). This study asks whether and to what extent German civil society organizations with a diverse background receive funds by public administrations, and how bias and discrimination exclude them from public funds allocation. At stake is access of a diverse civil society to the public funds system in Germany. 

Empirically, a survey of a sample of about 8.000 German civil society organizations to be fielded in spring of 2022 will shed light on both existing and perceived inclusion and exclusion mechanisms in the system of the German public funds allocation. We drew a stratified random sample of all non-profit associations, foundations and gGMBHs based on the German commercial register for the 16 state capitals. On the one hand, the survey reveals various aspects of diversity in civil society organizations, such as how diverse the leadership and personnel, as well as programs and projects are, but also to what extent diversity strategies and incentives are implemented. On the other hand, the survey sheds light on the extent to which civil society organizations apply for and receive funds by public administrations. 

This survey is part of a larger mixed-method project on public funds allocations to a diverse landscape of civil society organizations in Germany. The survey results will serve as groundwork for a series of subsequent qualitative and quantitative analyses whose results will enhance our understanding of the public fund allocation process from a diversity-sensitive perspective.",DeZIM / Hertie School,Ruhr-Universität Bochum,DeZIM Institute,German Institute for Integration and Migration Research (DeZIM),Deutsches Zentrum für Integrations- und Migrationsforschung (DeZIM),,,,Deutsches Zentrum für Integrations- und Migrationsforschung (DeZIM),,Caroline Assad,Ana-Maria Nikolas,Ralf Wölfer,Sabrina Zajak,Maryam Rutner,,,,Maryam Rutner,,Integration,Migration,Public Administration,Representation,Political Sociology,Mixed Methods,,,Diversity in German Civil Society: A Mixed-Method Study on Organizational Access to Public Funds,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65783&EventID=185
0,"The question of why the probability of votes against the party line differs among members of parliament (MPs) and legislative motions is part of a growing literature within parliamentary research. Whereas discipline-related as well as electoral reasons have been repeatedly discussed, another factor has remained largely neglected in the literature: division of labour within parliamentary party groups. Given the workload and the high level of specialization of parliamentary work, MPs usually engage in a few committees and the corresponding bodies of their party group and, therefore, are concerned with only a subset of all policies in detail. This leads to conflicting expectations with regard to their voting behaviour on the floor: On the one hand (policy-shaping hypothesis), MPs might have a lower probability to defect in votes on matters *within* their policy area of expertise since they are familiar with the contents of those motions and, presumably, even had the opportunity to shape their party group’s policy position – in accordance with their own one. On the other hand (cue-taking hypothesis), MPs might have a lower probability to defect in votes on matters *beyond* their policy area since it appears rational for them to simply adhere to the policy specialists of their party group and, thereby, conform to the division of labour principle. Both hypotheses are tested quantitatively using roll-call vote data of a powerful ‘working parliament’, the German Bundestag.

0,"For many citizens, online discussions are important for their political decision-making (Stromer-Galley, 2017). However, little is known about whether following and participating in online discussions motivate individuals to engage in other, more demanding forms of political participation such as protest (e.g., signing petitions) or institutional forms of engagement (e.g., donations; Theocharis et al., 2021). Particularly, it is unclear how different discussion environments in terms of the represented political attitudes affect further forms of participation – especially because usually studies only measure intentions to participate, but not real participative actions. Resorting to the Theory of Planned Behavior/TPB (Ajzen, 1985), we hypothesize that joining online discussions affect individuals’ attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavior control, which in turn influences the intention to participate, which, finally, affects actual participative actions (e.g., Ziegele et al., 2018).

For an empirical test of this hypothesis, a three-wave panel survey with two embedded experiments was conducted in 2020 with a German quota sample (N = 1,287). The respondents were exposed to online discussions on the questions of whether plastic packaging (PP) for fresh foods should be banned in supermarkets (wave 2) and whether genetically modified organisms (GMO) should be banned in food production (wave 3). In each wave, participants were randomly assigned to one of three discussion environments in which they were exposed to either (a) arguments for a ban, (b) balanced arguments, or (c) arguments against a ban (the manipulation was successful). After exposure, participants could sign a petition calling for a ban of PP (wave 2) or donate (parts of) their incentive to an organization that advocates for or against GMO (wave 3). Before the respondents could act, the central variables of the TPB were surveyed (attitude, subjective norm, perceived behavior control, intention). Socio-demographics and the central variables of the Civic Voluntarism Model (Verba et al., 1995) were used as control variables. The hypotheses were tested with logistic (wave 2) and linear hierarchical regressions (wave 3).

The results of the logistic regressions show that respondents who were exposed to arguments for banning PP were more likely to sign the petition than respondents who were exposed to arguments against PP. The results of the linear regressions show that participants who were exposed to balanced arguments donated more money to a pro-GMO organization compared to those who were exposed to arguments against GMO. Detailed results will be presented at the conference.

Our study indicates that following and debating in online discussions can have positive spill-over effects on other, more demanding forms of political participation. These “upstream effects” (Holbein & Rangel, 2020) emphasize the importance of political online discussions for citizens’ political decision-making. Furthermore, the direction of this impact seems to depend on the specific discussion environment in terms of the arguments citizens are exposed to (pro vs. contra vs. balanced). These observed effects can be well explained by the TPB.

0,"Despite the diffuse scholarly attention for the populist phenomenon, we still know little about the existence (or lack) of common motivations of populist parties’ voters across ideologies (Rooduijn, 2018), or their presence over time. Some scholars theorise that it might be possible to identify “a populist voter”. However, the large N studies that have tried to identify commonalities of left- and right-wing populist voters shed light on a more complicated picture. When tested empirically, most of the features that were thought to be common to populist supporters across ideologies have demonstrated diverse tendencies across countries (e.g. Rooduijn, 2018). One possible explanation for the scarcity of cohesive results is the lack of studies that consider both contextual and time differences in their statistical models. From a demand-side perspective, there is consensus over the definition of populism as a context and time-dependent phenomenon; we are lacking studies that investigate the latter aspect. Previous research has identified many relevant cross-sectional explanatory factors. Still, the crucial issue of change over time and how individual-level outcomes may depend on time-varying social, political, and economic conditions are so far left mostly unanswered. Thus, this study aims to investigate whether the motivations unifying voters of populist parties from left and right-wing ideologies have been consistently relevant in explaining the support for these parties across time and whether it is possible to identify a “periodization” of individual motives at different time-periods. Accordingly, this study explores the presence of commonalities among the voter base of populist parties across countries and across time by using nine waves of ESS data (2002-2018), in seven countries that have had established and successful populist parties for the whole period.","Norwegian University of Science & Technology, Trondheim",,,,,,,,"Norwegian University of Science & Technology, Trondheim",,Elena Baro,,,,,,,,Elena Baro,,European Politics,Populism,Quantitative,Public Opinion,,,,,Do populist voters have anything in common at all?

0,"This paper tests empirically whether populists in power redefine the state-society relations through tightening the control over civil society and lowering civic culture. I explore a wider conceptualization of civic culture that focuses on citizen mobilization as well as evaluations of formal national as well as supranational political institutions and relate it to the path dependency that originated at the critical junction of the global economic crisis. The results show that besides the strong control over civil society organizations, countries with long-term populist rule lack in strong civic culture as initial conditions. In addition, some evidence of institutional learning under extractive institutions further lowering civic culture exist, particularly in terms of political participation. The comparative example of the post-economic crisis Estonia and Hungary shows divergent paths within the region with the common dual (economic and political) transition. The economy and the ones’ positions in the income distribution as well as the success of the post-crisis recovery years prove to be the most important determinant of the difference in civic culture between the two countries.

0,"In recent years, the political right became almost perfectly aligned with a more exclusionary stance on immigration. I analyze the emergence of exclusionary discourses based on immigration news published in one of Germany’s most popular right-wing media outlets over a period of more than two decades (Jan 1998 to Dec 2019). In particular, I test the influence of three real-world developments that are closely connected to the idea of group threat: immigration numbers, terror attacks, and crime by foreign suspects.
I analyze data of Germany’s largest right-wing print outlet and the fifth largest weekly newspaper overall (Junge Freiheit, JF). Ideologically, the JF is located between the conservative and the far-right, often bridging democratic conservatism and the radical right. I trained a Naive Bayes classifier to identify articles about immigration based on hand-coded training data. Then, I used structural topic modeling to estimate the term probability for each topic and the topic probability for each article. I added the number of immigrants to Germany, the number of Islamist attacks, and reported crimes conducted by non-German suspects.
I coded the topics based on their most probable terms as well as articles (a more detailed discussion of this coding will be available in the full article). I define six topics as relating to immigration (German immigration policy, EU immigration policy, Integration/citizenship, Asylum, Illegal immigration, Demography), one topic is addressing Terrorism and two topics relate to security and crime (Crime and Ethnic violence). In addition to these topics, there are four topics that do not directly relate to the real-world developments but are theoretically interesting because they correspond to cultural (Religion, National identity) or economic (Economy, Welfare state) threat.
Firstly, the two topics that most strongly correlate with real-world immigration are Asylum and German immigration policy. For both topics, comparing times of lowest immigration with those of highest immigration implies an increase in topic probability by about six percentage points. With predicted probabilities of over eight percent, both topics dominate the JF output when immigration is high. Themes on cultural, economic, and security threat are work largely independent of world immigration developments.
Secondly, attacks in Western countries lead to an increase of the Terrorism topic by about 1.2 percentage points. While this increase is statistically significant, it’s not very large. In contrast, the Terrorism topic increased strongly by about 6.7 percentage points after attacks in Germany. Interestingly, although all the investigated attacks were motivated by religion, the attacks did not change the presence of the Religion topic at all according to the model.
Thirdly, reporting on crime is largely unconnected to real-world crime developments. While there is a positive effect on the Crime topic, it is limited in size. Comparing the lowest with the highest crime rates implies an increase of the predicted probability of the Crime topic by about one percentage point (from 3.9 to 4.8 percent). Ethnic violence, another topic that could potentially be connected to crime, is even negatively associated with actual crime.",Johann Wolfgang Goethe-Universität Frankfurt,,,,,,,,Johann Wolfgang Goethe-Universität Frankfurt,,Christian Czymara,,,,,,,,Christian Czymara,,Ethnic Conflict,Media,Nationalism,Immigration,Quantitative,Political Ideology,Big Data,,Do real-world developments predict far-right news on immigration?,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63907&EventID=185
0,"When and how does regulation reflect demands, concerns, and values held in society? This old question has received a renewed attention in recent years, as growing politicisation of regulation has put regulators under pressure to respond to public demands. Based on a case study of drug funding policies in England, this paper examines how a regulator’s pursuit of credibility in regulation – a key quality that is considered central to the legitimacy of the regulatory state – subsequently affects the timing and the extent to which the regulator responds to pressure in the public arena. It uses process tracing to evaluate different mechanisms of regulatory policy change, where a particular focus is placed on the regulator’s behaviour before, during, and after the change. Drug funding policies provide an excellent opportunity to develop arguments about the regulatory state under pressure, since regulatory choices on whether a drug is funded by, or excluded from, the public health care system illuminates whether such choices are congruent with social values. The paper’s findings highlight how a regulator’s legitimacy bases evolve over time; they have implications for the adaptability of the regulatory state in the face of pressure.",European University Institute,,,,,,,,European University Institute,,Takuya Onoda,,,,,,,,Takuya Onoda,,Governance,Institutions,Public Policy,Regulation,Policy Change,,,,Do Regulators Dream of Social Values?

0,"Do states learn and improve their practices after being found in violation by a supranational court? This paper analyzes the degree to which international courts may play a pedagogical role and the extent to which states learn from their past practices by looking at the case of the European Court of Human Rights (Court) and its Article 3 (prohibition of torture) jurisprudence. In order to ensure that the European Convention of Human Rights remains “practical and effective, not theoretical and illusory,” the Court has recognized a series of new obligations in its recent history and expanded the remit of existing protections under the European Convention of Human Rights. The introduction of procedural obligations under Article 3 is a prime example of this expansion, and it constitutes an innovative solution to cultivate a robust rule of law tradition across Europe. Using an original dataset that disaggregates the Court’s  Article 3 rulings at the level of the obligations, this article analyzes the extent to which countries found in violation of their procedural obligations improve their subsequent practices. This research offers two distinct contributions. First, it assesses whether being found in violation of procedural obligations decreases the likelihood of future violations under Article 3 and states’ ability to learn and improve their domestic procedures. Second, it evaluates the spread of procedural misconduct in Europe and shows whether the rule of law crisis is limited to well-known examples of Poland, Hungary, Russia, and Turkey.",Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies,Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies,,,,,,,Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies,Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies,Ezgi Yıldız,Umut Yüksel,,,,,,,Ezgi Yıldız,Umut Yüksel,Democracy,European Politics,Human Rights,Courts,Council of Europe,Judicialisation,Empirical,,Do States Learn?

0,"Transboundary crises spawn informal modes of global governance. This notion has become a truism in the academic debate on informal intergovernmental organizations (IIGOs) and empirical examples are, indeed, readily observable: In the coronavirus pandemic, the Group of Twenty (G-20), an IIGO of the world’s leading economies, entered the sphere of health governance to spearhead the global Covid-19 vaccination campaign COVAX. The Normandy Format talks in the contemporary Ukraine crisis serve as a recent example from the realm of interstate militarized conflict. Accordingly, scholarship expects crises to trigger the use of IIGOs, highlighting their low costs, quick decision-making processes, and ability to react to situations of high uncertainty as reasons for their involvement. However, the academic presumption of a crisis-informality-nexus suffers from at least two shortcomings. On the one hand, transboundary crises differ regarding the issue areas they affect, their potential to spread geographically, and the perceived urgency they evoke. Not every crisis type propels IIGOs to crisis managers. On the other hand, scholarship also overlooks the variety of IIGOs. They vary in their membership structure (and related resources), the issue areas they cover, and their institutional design. Not every type of IIGO is equally suitable to address crises. Moreover, the rationale for their use as crisis managers differs by type. The reasons for the involvement of an established, resourceful IIGO like the G-20 in a global health crisis likely differ from the emergence of a new ad-hoc contact group in militarized conflict. Therefore, the crisis-informality-nexus needs to be reevaluated. In how far are transboundary crises and IIGOs interrelated? Which crisis characteristics call for informalization the most? And which types of IIGOs are best suited to manage different crises? This paper addresses these questions by theorizing the crisis-informality-nexus. We provide a differentiated conceptualization of transboundary crises, present a typology of IIGOs, and explore the relationship between crisis characteristics and IIGO type. Empirical examples illustrate our theorization of the crisis-informality-nexus.",Friedrich-Schiller Universität Jena,Friedrich-Schiller Universität Jena,,,,,,,Friedrich-Schiller Universität Jena,,Philip M.

0,"Even decades after most European countries legalized abortion to some degree, the issue remains contentious and often positions feminist and human rights claims against the protected status of religion and an individual’s freedom of conscience. There has been considerable scholarship on abortion as the quintessential morality policy and on the role that religious institutions, particularly the Catholic Church, play in shaping abortion policy around the world. 

Many scholars have also analyzed the socioeconomic impacts of policies that limit access to abortion: in short, people with wealth and privilege have a much easier time getting an abortion than their peers with less money and limited ability to travel. Italy’s abortion law appears to address this issue by guaranteeing abortion services at public hospitals for no cost to the patient. In reality, however, Italian abortion seekers report difficulty procuring an abortion. This is often attributed Italy’s provision for doctors to register as conscientious objectors and thereby opt out of abortion care. Many countries allow conscientious objection to abortion, but Italy has higher rates of objection than other countries as well as high quality data on the rates of objection. There has been a great deal of theory written about the ethics of conscientious objection, as well as analyses of its impact on abortion access, particularly in the Italian case. 

By considering the doctor’s desire to object and the patient’s desire to choose abortion both to be legally protected rights, Italian Law 194/78 promises a contradiction. Past scholars have explored the experiences of abortion seekers in Italy and elsewhere, so in my analysis I focus on healthcare personnel. By speaking with doctors on both sides of this issue as well as healthcare administrators on various levels, I seek to better understand why Italy struggles to guarantee abortion access through policy measures, with an eye towards what changes might improve the administration of this law. I focused my interviews in the region of Puglia, where there is an above average level of objection among gynecologists, an above average abortion rate, net inflows of abortion seekers from outside the region, and a historical court decision that makes it difficult for hospitals to hire abortion providers. 

At first glance, it is not surprising that Italy has high rates of objectors, given its strong Catholic heritage and close relations with the Vatican. In this paper, I investigate the nature of conscientious objection claims in Italy today. Based on the literature, I expect to find that there may be abuse of claiming conscientious objection, where some people do not truly have a religious or moral objection to abortion. Instead of moral values, I expect to find that economic, labor, and social concerns motivate these doctors to object. I also anticipate that various authorities will attribute responsibility for guaranteeing the provision of abortion services to other levels of authority, resulting in a situation where no actor feels empowered to enforce this policy.",Max Planck Institute for the Study of Societies – MPIfG,,,,,,,,Max Planck Institute for the Study of Societies – MPIfG,,Danielle Pullan,,,,,,,,Danielle Pullan,,Gender,Public Administration,Religion,Social Policy,Family,Feminism,Southern Europe,,Doctors’ rights vs. patients’ rights: analysing the implementation of Italian abortion policy in Puglia,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63480&EventID=185
0,"In the external dimension of European Union (EU) migration policy, researchers have observed an increasing reliance on non-binding readmission arrangements since 2016. These informal arrangements eschew procedures explicitly laid out in the Treaties and side-line the European Parliament in their creation and monitoring. This development stands in contrast to the post-Lisbon Parliamentarization trend, since Parliamentary powers of scrutiny and legislation are severely curtailed in a policy area where the Parliament’s consent is required for formal readmission agreements. In this paper, we analyse the Parliament’s behaviour in light of its diminished prerogatives drawing on a qualitative analysis of Parliamentary policy and legislative documents (2014-2021), LIBE Committee hearings as well as interviews with Members of the Parliament and Parliamentary advisors. In line with previous literature on Parliamentarisation, we would have expected the Parliament to swiftly act to protect its prerogatives by resorting to all (or most of the) actions at its disposal, such as threatening the executive with (legal and political) sanctions, linking issues and policy arenas, building alliances with other actors outside and inside the institutions, and/or engaging in public shaming. However, while the Parliament has employed some of such actions, as of late 2021 it has not relied on its most impactful supervisory and budgetary powers. Most notably, it has not legally challenged the conduct of the European Commission and of the Council of the EU in readmission policy. We rely on rational choice and constructivist theories to explain the Parliament’s reluctance to use all available strategies to counter informalization. Our findings question the assumption that the Parliament has steadily gained influence and powers vis-à-vis other EU institutions and aim to contribute to the literature on the impact of soft law and informalization on inter-institutional relations in the EU.",University of Amsterdam,University of Helsinki,,,,,,,University of Amsterdam,,Davide Gnes,Milka Sormunen,,,,,,,Davide Gnes,,Democracy,European Politics,European Union,Migration,European Parliament,,,,Dodging the Fight?

0,"For international climate targets to be achieved, they need to be backed by effective climate mitigation policies. In this regard, there is ongoing discussion in the literature and within policy circles on the role of carbon pricing. Proponents argue that carbon pricing is effective, efficient, and can generate revenues to support parallel social or environmental goals; while opponents suggest that stringent carbon pricing faces insurmountable political barriers, and has so far demonstrated little effectiveness in real world settings. Yet so far there has been little effort to synthesise the ex-post literature on carbon pricing effectiveness using a formal and reproducible method that limits numerous biases. In this article we aim to do so, shedding light on the effectiveness of carbon pricing schemes with regard to emission reductions. We systematically review quasi-experimental policy evaluations from varying contexts worldwide.  

We extensively search the literature using a comprehensive search query in multiple literature databases, including Web of Science, Scopus, RePEc and JSTOR. We apply pre-defined and transparent eligibility criteria to identify relevant studies that estimate ex-post mitigation effects of carbon pricing schemes. We include studies using a broad set of study designs to single-out the effect of a specific policy on the emissions pathway. Our final sample will comprise approximately 50 primary studies, studying at least 14 carbon pricing schemes across the globe. We conduct a comprehensive risk of bias analysis to evaluate the validity of the research methods in the included studies and extract all estimated effect sizes of the causal impact of the policy implementation on carbon emissions. We synthesise the study outcomes using established meta-analysis methods to understand not only mean effects of the policy implementation, but also patterns that explain variations in the data. We aim to answer (i) whether the mitigation effect fades or intensifies over time, (ii) which impact the price level and coverage of the pricing policy have, and (iii) which role other design features of the policy play. Our preliminary results suggest that carbon pricing policies reduce emissions between 2 and 16 percent, with large variations between pricing schemes and estimation methods. The final results will provide evidence on the impact of different sources of variation in relation to different instrument designs, policy types, targeted sectors, and times after implementation.",University of Leeds,MCC Berlin,Mercator Research Institute on Global Commons and Climate Change (MCC),Mercator Research Institute on Global Commons and Climate Change - MCC Berlin,Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin,Mercator Research Institute on Global Commons and Climate Change - MCC Berlin,Mercator Research Institute on Global Commons and Climate Change - MCC Berlin,Mercator Research Institute on Global Commons and Climate Change - MCC Berlin,University of Leeds,,Niklas Döbbeling,Tarun Khanna,Nicolas Koch,William Lamb,Klaas Miersch,Jan Minx,Nils Ohlendorf,Jan Steckel,Niklas Döbbeling,,Environmental Policy,Policy Analysis,Quantitative,Causality,Climate Change,Empirical,,,Does carbon pricing reduce emissions? – A systematic review and meta-analysis of the ex-post literature,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65065&EventID=185

We theorise the potential, or otherwise, of crowdsourced participation in addressing the well documented malaise in contemporary liberal democracies. To evaluate the distinctiveness of a crowdsourced logic we contrast crowdsourced and institutionalised forms of political engagement along four levels: micro individual; meso organisational; macro governance; and meta ideational. Based on analysis of original survey data, scraped platform data, and interviews, we show that the interplay across these four levels of engagement presents opportunities for political change, while challenging governing institutions to adapt to crowdsourced engagement by citizens and organised advocates Yet while our analysis is a relatively optimistic one of agile, mass-based citizen engagement, we also reflect on the growing dark and anti-democratic side of citizen mobilisation and information sharing that corporate social media platforms foster and rarely choose to regulate or dampen.

Specifically, we are interested in the deliberative conditions that promote future-oriented outcomes and that lead to the inclusion of future-oriented perspectives. Additionally, we want to know how the causal mechanism between deliberation and future-oriented outcomes can be explained. We find that deliberation better succeeds at promoting future-oriented perspectives than producing future-oriented outcomes, and identify four conditions that can explain the variation in the results of our data.

0,"What are the effects of ideology on the speeches delivered at the United Nations? Previous research has already demonstrated that countries’ attitudes vary in accordance with the ideology of governments (Kreppel & Tsebelis, 1999; Hooghe, Marks e Wilson, 2002; Onuki e Oliveira, 2006; Potrafke, 2009). This happens because there is a relationship among domestic pressures, preferences, and international behaviour (Putnam, 1988; Hermann, 1990). However, the boundaries between left and right in international issues are flexible and changeable. Since the end of the Cold War, several organizations were raised and reformed as result of the new interaction nets among the States and the multiplicity of the international agendas. In this conjuncture, named as complex interdependence by Keohane and Nye (1977), the role of ideas has gained more and more space in the States’ strategies of international projection. Thus, the main purpose of this paper is to investigate whether the speeches of G-20 leaders, with different ideological positions, are centered in alliances already established with traditional powers or if seeks a diversification of their partners. The choice of G-20 members is underpinned in the fact that they are the better representatives of different levels of power States (great, middle, and new powers) (Giley & O’Neil, 2014). It is assumed that the more countries and organizations are quoted in the speeches the greater the government’s intention to raise its State to an international leadership position. Through a Dictionary Analysis it will be possible to notice trends in manifest contents throughout the cases, between 2000 and 2020, and understand if the interests declared by left and right governments are, or not, divergent in terms of their projection as an international leader. The main hypothesis is that left governments tend to seek leadership roles, while right ones tend to follow traditional great powers such as the United States, China, Russia, Japan or some European countries.",Universidade Federal de Pernambuco,Universidade Federal de Pernambuco (Brazil),,,,,,,Universidade Federal de Pernambuco (Brazil),,Luiza Amelotti,Marcelo de Almeida Medeiros,,,,,,,Marcelo de Almeida Medeiros,,Political Leadership,UN,International,Political Ideology,Empirical,Member States,,,Does ideology matter?

0,"How do supporters of the far right think about income inequality and redistribution? This question is as much unresolved as it is essential, considering how far-right parties have in recent decades entered by force the electoral competition in democracies worldwide. Research on the far-right’s positions on socio-economic inequality has so far predominantly focused on party positions, describing radical right-wing parties either as ambivalent on social policy issues (Rovny and Polk, 2019), or gradually more supportive of redistribution as a response to their working-class electoral base (Afonso and Rennwald, 2018). On the demand side, the European radical right electorate seems to desire a ‘particularistic-authoritarian’ welfare state with limited support for social transfers only to “deserving” beneficiaries (Busemeyer et al., 2022). 
While these studies reveal the distinct social policy and welfare preferences the far right, they do not shed enough light on the underlying attitudes that drive social policy preferences. Attitudes on inequality and redistribution draw strongly on normative expectations and conceptions of justice. Hence, their drivers are likely distinct from those of concrete policy proposals concerning the distribution of goods and burdens in society. 
Inspired by the literatures on welfare state preferences and social justice norms, we investigate how far-right voters think about income inequality and redistribution on three points:
1.	How much inequality do far-right voters tolerate in society?
2.	How do they conceive the role of ordinary people in combatting inequality?
3.	How supportive are they in principle of fiscal redistribution?
The analyses use the 2019 Social Inequality module of the International Social Survey Programme (ISSP). The 2019 ISSP is a cross-national survey in public opinion, containing at present data from 22 countries worldwide. With high-quality comparative data, we can examine the contextual moderators of the attitudes of far-right supporters. Inequality and redistribution attitudes develop in environments that differ e.g. in terms of the public’s support for meritocracy (Roex et al., 2019) or economic insecurity (Melcher, 2021).
Our analyses suggest that far-right voters are more tolerant of income inequality than center-right (“mainstream party”) voters. Firstly, they are more likely to believe that income inequality is necessary for a country’s prosperity, especially in countries where public support for meritocracy is high. Secondly, far-right voters are more skeptical about ordinary people’s ability to combat inequality. Yet, this relationship is weaker when popular belief in meritocracy is high and economic insecurity is widespread. Finally, far-right voters are less supportive of tax increases to the wealthy. Paradoxically, this relationship is more pronounced in countries where income insecurity is high.
The results help us to draw a profile of the inequality and redistribution attitudes of far-right citizens and examine how the contextual environment interacts in the relationship between political ideology and public opinion. Considering how successful far-right parties have been in recent elections across the globe, the opinions and demands of its electorate are becoming increasingly influential in democratic policy-making. Finding that this electorate has distinct expectations and opinions about socio-economic inequality may have implications on the future trajectories of the welfare state.",Université de Lausanne,,,,,,,,Université de Lausanne,,Annika Lindholm,,,,,,,,Annika Lindholm,,Extremism,Populism,Social Justice,Comparative Perspective,Public Opinion,Survey Research,,,"Does Income Inequality Really Bother Us, “the People”?

0,"The performance of regulatory regimes in terms of protecting citizens from risks while securing compliance from companies, is not only depending upon the actions of the sectoral regulatory agency. This paper elaborates the idea that it is the interplay of EU, political, administrative and regulatory actors, as well as their interactions with the regulatees and interest groups which together determines regime performance. A crucial condition for this interplay to function well, is that actors within the regime trust each other sufficiently. Building upon the duality of trust and distrust and the notions of dysfunctional trust and functional distrust, this assumption is nuanced, and the paper develops a second argument that regimes might perform the best when there are functional trust-distrust balances between different kinds of actors within the regulatory regime. This paper then uses data from the TiGRE survey on trustor perception of trust and distrust in different regime actors in data protection, food safety and financial sector, in order to assess such thresholds and functional balances of trust and distrust for well-functioning regimes through explanatory analyses, while controlling for individual, sector and country variables. The analyses also aim to understand whether trust/distrust in different actor types (political, administrative, regulatory actors and private actors) differ in terms of their power in explaining perceived regime performance. By comparing data protection with food safety and financial regulation, the paper will also shed light upon the specificities of trust and distrust in data protection in Europe, and will gauge whether such specificities also impact upon the regime performance in data protection.",Universiteit Antwerpen,Université de Lausanne,Universiteit Antwerpen,,,,,,Universiteit Antwerpen,,Koen Verhoest,Edoardo Guaschino,Jan Wynen,,,,,,Koen Verhoest,,Public Administration,Regulation,Comparative Perspective,,,,,,Does it matter whom you trust?

Following Hansen (2013), we regard a large-scale municipal amalgamation reform as a quasi-experiment. Such a reform makes it possible to compare trends in merged and non-merged municipalities, and thereby separate the effects of changes in size from other trends. However, this approach creates a new problem: how can the effect of the reform process be separated from the effect of size as such? Hansen argues that if changes in size itself matters, the junior partners in a merger – who experience a larger change – will differ from both senior partners and unmerged municipalities. We will explore this potential difference, but also compare trust in local and national politicians, since the size of the national political unit is unchanged. We use data from the Norwegian Local Election Studies of 2011 and 2019 (before and at the time of the merger), and compare the development of trust in local and national politicians in 1) unmerged municipalities, 2) ‘senior partners’ in merged municipalities, and 3) ‘junior partners’ in merged municipalities.","Institute for Social Research, Oslo",UiT – Norges Arktiske Universitet,"Institute for Social Research, Oslo",,,,,,"Institute for Social Research, Oslo",UiT – Norges Arktiske Universitet,Jo Saglie,Øystein Solvang,Marte Winsvold,,,,,,Jo Saglie,Øystein Solvang,Citizenship,Democracy,Local Government,,,,,,Does municipal amalgamation affect trust in local politicians?,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64397&EventID=185

0,"There is abundant evidence that humans regularly prioritize negative information. On average, people tend to focus more on negative information than positive information, and people tend to be more affected by negative information. While studies find that negativity biases are widespread, there also are significant individual differences. Some people are more reactive to negative information than others.

Although some initial work suggested that individuals exhibiting larger negativity biases tend to be on the right side of the ideological spectrum, recent research has failed to find systematic differences between conservatives and liberals in psychophysiological reactions to negative and positive information. 

This paper focuses on the role of personality. Is the sensitivity to negative information in news consumption linked to personality traits across the globe? We examine the relationship between personality and negativity biases in physiological reactions with massive cross-national experimental data. We conducted the same psychophysiological experiment in 17 countries on six continents. These places differ in terms of cultural attributes, economic development, media environments, and political institutions. Participants were exposed to both negative and positive television news stories while their electrodermal activity was measured by sensors. Personality was assessed in a post-experimental survey using the ten-item personality inventory of the Big 5 traits (TIPI). We use these data to test whether the differences in physiological reactions between negative and positive news stories are related to personality traits across these various cross-national settings.",Université de Montréal,"University of Michigan, Ann Arbor",,,,,,,Université de Montréal,,Patrick Fournier,Stuart Soroka,,,,,,,Patrick Fournier,,Media,Communication,Comparative Perspective,Experimental Design,,,,,Does Personality Predict Individual Variation in Negativity Biases in News Consumption?,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64256&EventID=185
0,"In recent decades, studies have shown that social capital relates to various dimensions of political culture, such as trust in political institutions, support for or satisfaction with democracy. Regarding citizens’ democratic knowledge, which refers to the cognitive dimension of attitudes towards democracy, only few studies examine the influence of social capital. Most of these studies include indicators such as social trust or civic participation as control variables, rather than theorizing more deeply why social capital should matter. Thus, our study aims to contribute to this research by focusing on the relationship between variations of social capital and democratic knowledge. On the micro-level, we distinguish between bridging and bonding social capital. Bridging social capital is related to open social networks, generalized trust and can be seen as more inclusive. Bonding social capital is related to closed social networks, particularized trust and can be seen as more exclusive. We expect, that bridging social capital will relate positively to democratic knowledge while bonding social capital should have a negative relationship to citizen´s democratic knowledge.

0,"Legitimacy and scope of the necessary climate action have been discussed for decades already. Actors denying and challenging the climate change are, however, still an integral part of these debates. One of the most important layers where these battles take place is media discourse, where contested understanding of climate change shapes the debate in two fundamental ways: what is being discussed and how the issues are discussed. Research on climate denial points to different strategies ranging from questioning the existence of the warming trend through the questionable human contribution to rejection of any significant impact. The latter has been recently recognized as discourses of climate delay that “accept the existence of climate change, but justify inaction or inadequate efforts” (Lamb et al. 2020). The success of delay-based strategies thus may importantly translate into postponing or questioning the need for a robust mitigation response. We contribute to the study of the discourses of climate delay through the case of the Czech Republic, a post-communist EU member state, where doubting the climate change has a long tradition due to a vocal denialist president Vaclav Klaus as well as a strong influence of the fossil industry. We use discourse network analysis to explore what discursive strategies are used and by whom in the public debate before and after the adoption of the Paris Agreement.",Masaryk University,Masaryk University,,,,,,,Masaryk University,,Lukáš Lehotský,Petr Ocelík,,,,,,,Lukáš Lehotský,,Environmental Policy,Public Policy,Coalition,Climate Change,Communication,Policy-Making,,,Does the Climate Matter?

0,"Global governance has recently been confronted with a wide variety of new cooperation problems in and across diverse issue-areas, including climate change, global health, financial regulation, and artificial intelligence. Many of these problems, such as Covid-19, have led to crisis situations. In addition, political transformations, such as a changing global power distribution, have weakened the foundations of traditional governance arrangements. 

New problems have induced a proliferation of alternative institutional forms – such as IIGOs, TGNs, TPPPs, and PTROs – alongside state-based treaties and FIGOs, the major incumbent institutions in global governance. Importantly, these diverse institutions do not operate separately from one another, but are interconnected in various ways. Thus, the proliferation of alternative institutional forms has given rise to the emergence of ‘Hybrid Institutional Complexes’ (HICs), which incorporate all those governance institutions that seek to address specific (if multifaceted) cooperation problems.  

This paper asks in how far this HICs-based global governance system is fit for purpose. More precisely, it asks how well its institutional variety enables global governance to cope with the stressors it faces today.

To analyze this important question, we apply the concept of ‘resilience,’ which encapsulates the notion of persistence in unfavourable circumstances. Resilience includes readiness and preparedness for stresses and threats on one hand, and responsiveness and adaptation to stresses and threats on the other. To be resilient to the stresses it faces, then, contemporary global governance systems must strike an appropriate balance between rigidity and flexibility. We argue that a HICs-based system is better suited to achieve that balance than a centralized governance system.

The paper is structured as follows: First, we identify the most important stressors of contemporary global governance: new and multifaceted cooperation problems that cross established issue areas; frequent crises, characterized by a combination of seriousness and immediacy; and political transformations (such as the rise of authoritarian populism and a changing power distribution) that undercut the effectiveness of institutions organized around pre-transition conditions. 

Second, we identify the specific demands such stressors create for global governance: a demand for more flexible institutional forms that can innovate in terms of governance arrangements, allowing rapid and effective responses to problems and crises; and a demand for change in legacy institutions to reflect changing political realities. 
Third, we introduce the concept of resilience to discuss how governance institutions can respond to these demands. We compare the resilience of two types of global governance systems: a (centralized) FIGO-based system and a (decentralized) HICs-based system. We advance a two-pronged claim: first, in a static sense, decentralized systems are more resilient than centralised systems at any point in time; and second, in a dynamic sense, centralized systems become more rigid, and thus more vulnerable, over time. The latter argument suggests that it is essential for governance systems to maintain conditions that allow for new institutional entrants, able to renew the existing system in light of current stresses.",Newcastle University,Arizona State University,,,,,,,Newcastle University,,Benjamin Faude,Kenneth W.

0,"What do citizens think of lobbying when it is visible? Despite the growing interest for lobbying and public opinion research in political science, little is known about citizen’s attitudes towards interest groups, especially after legislation making lobbying transparent is passed. Using data from a pre-registered survey experiment conducted with a panel of 580 participants from the Republic of Ireland, our study shows that when exposed to information about lobbying conducted by Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) and business organisations, citizens do not improve their evaluations of interest groups. More specifically, the disclosure of lobbying information found on transparency registers is not associated to an increase of trust and perception of integrity of NGOs and business groups. Moreover, citizen characteristics such as political interest, political ideology and previous attitudes do not appear to moderate the effects of lobbying transparency. Despite its null findings, the study adds much needed clarity to how citizens feel about lobbying. Surprisingly, against the general expectations found in the transparency and trust literature, information about lobbying does not trigger changes in evaluations of interest groups. The study, however, also reveals that lobbying transparency does not backfire. This may be a first indication that the generally-held assumption that citizens distrust all lobbying is gone. This adds a new perspective to the recent debate on how public opinion responds to interest group behaviour.",Queen's University Belfast,,,,,,,,Queen's University Belfast,,Michele Crepaz,,,,,,,,Michele Crepaz,,Interest Groups,Lobbying,NGOs,,,,,,Does transparency in lobbying impact trust and perceptions of integrity of interest groups?,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63783&EventID=185
0,"I revisit the widely-accepted finding that war produces an improvement in women’s political empowerment. Recently, a growing body of studies argue that war, particularly civil wars, disrupt existing power arrangements and social institutions and open the opportunities for women to improve their political power by allowing women to reform political institutions and to participate the processes of conflict management and peace building. Among others, Webster, Chen, and Beardsley (2019) (hereafter WCB) provide the most systematic evidence for the argument that war leads to an increase in women’s political empowerment. Despite its important contributions, however, two important puzzles remain unresolved. First, it is not clear whether war improves women’s political representation because the measure of women’s political empowerment used in their analysis, obtained from the Varieties of Democracy Project, is an aggregate index capturing multiple dimensions including women’s legislative representation. The other remaining question is whether intrastate and interstate wars have similar effects on women’s political empowerment and representation. Second, WCB find no difference between civil and interstate war, which is puzzling, given that civil wars tend to be more frequent, deadlier, and longer-lasting and present unique opportunities to renegotiate and reshape domestic governance and political institutions. I attempt to examine whether civil war increases women’s legislative representation by re-examining WCB’s data. My analysis reveals that civil wars are correlated with a decrease in women’s legislative representation. This result holds even when I focus on the termination of civil war via gender-inclusive peace agreements or when I limit my analysis to a specific temporal (e.g., the post-Cold War era) or a regional context (e.g., Sub-Saharan Africa). Last, I find a similar pattern when I examine the relationship between civil wars and women’s cabinet appointments. These results pose a challenge to the conventional wisdom that civil war leads to the improvement of women's political representation.",Korea University,,,,,,,,Korea University,,Nam Kyu Kim,,,,,,,,Nam Kyu Kim,,Comparative Politics,Conflict Resolution,Gender,Political Violence,Representation,,,,Does War Improve Women’s Political Representation?,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64082&EventID=185
0,"Western democracies face competing pressures in the regulation of international migration that forces
 governments to balance needs for economic openness with demands for political closure. The public policy literature suggests that facing opposing demands, governments may resort to strategies of venue-shopping whereby they shift political decision-making to institutional fora in which such opposition is reduced. This paper examines to which extent preferential trade agreements and bilateral labour agreements constitute a venue to meet economic demand for certain types of economic mobility while circumventing political constraints, thereby perpetuating the ‘liberal paradox’ that predominates in liberal democratic immigration systems. Based on an original database of migration provisions in trade agreements (MITA), the paper examines OECD countries’ and the EU’s strategic venue-shopping for the liberalization of labour mobility on the basis of all preferential trade agreements concluded by these countries since the 1980s, and compares this with the conclusion of Bilateral Labour Agreements regulating temporary labour mobility and domestic regulations on labour migration. While disclosing a hitherto under-investigated facet of contemporary labour migration, the findings have important implications for our understanding of the logics driving the inclusion of non-trade issues  in preferential trade agreements and of the venues through which liberal democracies govern desired forms of economic migration in times of growing anti-immigration sentiment.",Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam,University of Geneva,University of Geneva,,,,,,University of Geneva,,Philipp Lutz,Sandra Lavenex,Paula Hoffmeyer-Zlotnik,,,,,,Paula Hoffmeyer-Zlotnik,,Globalisation,Policy Analysis,Immigration,Trade,Comparative Perspective,,,,Domestic and international labour migration policies: Complementarity or disparity?,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64592&EventID=185

While the existing literature documents the central role of environmental civil society organizations (ECSO) in the Indian climate policy, a systematic, empirical investigation into the nature, extent, evolution, and heterogeneity of their role remains a gap to be addressed. We surveyed prominent policy actors in the Indian climate domain during 2021-2022 to identify the link between domestic and international climate policy engagement of ECSO. The overarching objective is to investigate the agenda-setting and mediating role of ECSOs in (a) sieving the international climate rulebook to fit the domestic agenda and NDCs, and (b) facilitating the integration of NDC into actual domestic policy.

0,"Questions about the public desire for differentiated integration have gained increasing prominence in academic debates about the path forward for the post-Brexit EU. However, we still do not know much about how exposure to differentiated integration shapes the public’s views of it. 
Using survey data from 2020-21, this paper finds that exposure to externally imposed temporal differentiation has no real effect on support for the very same mode of differentiation. Similarly, the exposure to voluntary modes of constitutional differentiation found in the Nordic countries has spawned no similar increase in support for the increased use of constitutional differentiated integration in EU policies. There is however a strong effect of Central and Eastern European and Nordic citizenship on support for constitutional differentiated integration. This may be explained by how the Euroscepticism of both regions tend to have a sovereigntist bent. In other words, the current patterns of politicization of integration may be more important for explaining support for differentiation than the historical exposure to it. 
The results are important because they shine a light on the drivers of support for a more differentiated post-Brexit EU. These insights will be important both to the still emerging literature on public support for differentiated integration as well as political debates about the shape of the future EU.",Universitetet i Oslo,,,,,,,,Universitetet i Oslo,,Martin Moland,,,,,,,,Martin Moland,,European Union,Differentiation,Euroscepticism,,,,,,Domination and differentiation: Examining the link between implementation of and support for differentiated integration,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63560&EventID=185

The dynamics of tipping processes converge and diverge between social and the related climate systems. But, the coupling of social and climate systems remains comparatively underdefined. Here we explore how [anticipated] changes to climate systems can instigate necessary positive transformations within social systems - the wanted tipping points. Adopting novel survey data from the United States, we investigate how sea-level rise (SLR) risk perceptions shape climate change relevant behavioral intentions and policies. We find that SLR risk perceptions are strongly, positively related to a diverse set of behavioral and policy measures under analysis in this study. Furthermore, we find that SLR perceptions are one of the strongest drivers towards these climate change behavioral intentions, comparatively stronger than many other common individual-level determinants (e.g. political attitudes, forms of trust). These findings emphasize the potential role of SLR perceptions as instigators of social tipping dynamics. Heightened risk perceptions could be influential in transcending the temporal barriers presented by the necessity for contemporary socio-technical transformations to mitigate future climate impacts - serving as a normatively desirable trigger of positive [wanted] social tipping dynamics.",ETH Zurich,"GESIS, Leibniz",Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research,,,,,,ETH Zurich,,E.

0,"The exposure of migrants to several human rights violations are recurrent in perilous routes when a State is unable to protect them. Despite the COVID-19 pandemic and its consequent travel curbs, the number of migrants increased in 2021, according to official migration reports. Nevertheless, besides risks such as drowning, hypothermia and food insecurity, routes have become even more dangerous, due to COVID-19. Consequently, States adopted more restrictive migration policies in their territories. The pandemic has not only taken attention away from humanitarian crises, it has exacerbated them and conflict-affected areas were forgotten. In the context of mass influx, migrants have been seen as threats to national security like never before. During the pandemic, rescue at sea has been threatened by the refusal of States to allow the disembarkation of those rescued. Hence, NGOs appealed to the Italian government to end the Italy-Libya Memorandum of
Understanding. This paper explores the impacts of the pandemic as security and safety risks faced by migrants on their journeys along the Central Mediterranean route to southern Europe. Adopting a broad view of human security and migration, we will analyze how Italy, a common transit hub, managed the arrival of migrants and asylum-seekers during the pandemic and the risks of expulsion or refoulement. The role of smugglers, health conditions and the right to liberty and protection from arbitrary detention will also be addressed.

0,"Affective polarisation captures partisan animus – the emotional rift between political opponents rooted in people’s tendency to have a more positive affect towards co-partisans than political opponents. Affective polarisation has increased in the US and in the UK, but there is still much debate on the causes of this phenomenon. Recent studies suggest that internet usage may increase affective polarisation through exposure to polarising content, but the theory is ambiguous. Moreover, extant research focuses overwhelmingly on the emblematic US case, and it often falls short of establishing a causal relationship. Finally, it is unclear whether affective polarisation is growing because of stronger positive sentiment towards the co-partisans, greater animosity between political opponents, or both simultaneously.
Against this background, I propose to identify the causal effect of internet usage on affective polarisation in the United Kingdom. I assemble a dataset merging newly released large-N geocoded panel data on individual behaviour with postcode-level data on internet performance. This enables me to leverage exogenous variations in internet usage at the individual level, where internet usage in each wave is instrumented by time-varying local-level measures of internet performance – which depend on local infrastructure developments and are thus independent of individual characteristics.
I find that internet usage does increase both conventional affective polarisation and cross-cutting polarisation around Brexit identities. However, internet performance does not appear to have an effect on individual internet usage in the studied time period. Further investigation reveals that performance has a negligible effect on aggregate internet usage, using registry data at postcode level, the lowest level of aggregation. Finally, I show that even relative micro-level aggregate measures of internet performance hide substantial underlying variation.",University of Warwick,,,,,,,,University of Warwick,,Carlo Hofer,,,,,,,,Carlo Hofer,,Media,Internet,Quantitative,Regression,Social Media,Causality,Brexit,,Downloading polarisation: the effect of internet consumption on affective polarisation in the United Kingdom,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65500&EventID=185
0,"With the climate crisis looming large over the world’s societies, immediate action is required to prepare for and adapt to current and future climate change. Despite increasing calls for action, certain policy sectors remain slow or even resistant to change, and limited action on the part of policy makers and authorities prevails. Current understanding of the drivers and determinants of such policy inaction remains arguably limited, with research tending to identify static ‘barriers’ to adaptation. However, to go beyond these narrow, linear barriers, more recently the concept of climate adaptation policy lock-ins has been brought forward. From this perspective, the adaptation gap is determined by path-dependent dynamics of self-reinforcing mechanisms that narrow the opportunity space for alternative actions and potentially lock in specific pathways within policy subsystems. Such self-reinforcing mechanisms are not limited to the political realm but emphasize the feedbacks that link policy decisions and institutions to infrastructures and technologies, as well as human behavior, routines, and practices. Together, these constitute strong forces of path-dependency and system rigidity that stabilize incumbent paradigms and policies, blocking changes necessary for climate adaptation.
With this study, we aim to advance the lock-in perspective by exploring the systemic drivers that determine these self-reinforcing dynamics through a crossed, comparative design, applying set-theoretic analysis. Considering 18 cases comprising of six climate adaptation problem domains (coastal protection, water scarcity, forestry, biodiversity conservation, heat stress, mental health after extreme weather events) in three countries (UK, Netherlands, Germany) each, we pay particular attention to the institutional, physical, and societal resources that are maintaining incumbent policies and paradigms. Such resources include e.g. dominant types of knowledge, socio-cultural beliefs, or governance architectures, that together are at the center of lock-in dynamics and drive their reproduction. By means of Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA) we distill archetypical patterns of how these resources co-occur in order to identify overarching patterns of drivers of lock-in dynamics. Understanding these dynamics provides the fundament for designing transformative policies and fostering those specific capacities of adaptiveness and reflexivity that are instrumental for closing the climate adaptation gap.",University of East Anglia,Open Universiteit Nederland,Open University of the Netherlands,Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam,Carl Von Ossietzky Universität Oldenburg,Carl Von Ossietzky Universität Oldenburg,University of East Anglia,University of East Anglia,Carl Von Ossietzky Universität Oldenburg,,Meghan Alexander,Lisanne Groen,Jean Hugé,Dave Huitema,Nicolas Jager,Julie King,Tim Rayner,John Turnpenny,Nicolas Jager,,Environmental Policy,Qualitative Comparative Analysis,Climate Change,Comparative Perspective,Policy Change,,,,Drivers of stagnation – A set-theoretic analysis of the determinants of climate adaptation policy lock-ins,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65533&EventID=185
0,"Turkish migrants holding dual citizenship and living in Belgium generally support right-wing parties, candidates and politics in their homeland and left-wing parties, candidates and politics in Belgium. Some of these voters state that they support left in Belgium with the same religious and/or nationalist feelings and thoughts, and perceive this situation as a consistency (ideologically or pragmatically) for themselves. On the other hand, some of them define this duality as an ideological contradiction and develop various strategies to overcome it (such as not voting in the Belgian elections in order not to support ""communists or atheists"" or voting for the Christian Democrats since they are ""at least religious""). Based on semi-structured in-depth interviews and focus group discussions conducted in 2017 with total 93 participants in Brussels (Brussels Capital Region), Antwerp (Flemish Region) and Liège (Walloon Region), this paper aims to discuss how the described ""contradiction"" is understood and interpreted from the eyes of the voters, taking into account the unique dynamics of Turkish and Belgian politics.

0,"There seems to be a widespread sense that politics and societies in liberal democracies are becoming more and more hostile and divided. Beyond mere ideological disagreement, political conflict is turning into a question of ‘us’ versus ‘them’, a phenomenon increasingly referred to as ‘affective polarisation’ (e.g., Iyengar et al., 2019; Reiljan, 2020; Wagner, 2021). While research on affective polarisation has recently started to move beyond its original focus on the United States,  it is still unclear what precisely the concept actually means, what it entails, and how exactly it unfolds – particularly in multi-party systems, in which divides between political groups are far less clear and political conflict is not necessarily structured along party lines (Harteveld, 2021; Hobolt et al., 2020). Furthermore, while both affect and identity are at the heart of dynamics of affective polarisation, thus far, surprisingly little attention has been paid to the nature of those two core elements, how they come into being, and how they relate to each other. 

In this paper, I aim to shed light on those ambiguities by providing a conceptual analysis of affective polarisation and the relationship between its three components – ideology, identity and affect – as well as an empirical analysis of the dynamics between those three elements. 
I argue that dynamics of affective polarisation can arise not only out of conflict between pre-defined social and political identities, such as partisanship or national, ethnic or religious identities, but also out of processes of intense politicisation (e.g. Brexit in the UK or debates about abortion in many Latin American countries) and crises (e.g. the refugee crisis, the climate crisis or the recent Covid-19 pandemic). 

I then aim to analyse the mechanism through which such periods of intense politicisation or crisis turn into highly affective conflict between different political identities by conducting an in-depth case study on the polarising context of the Covid-19 crisis in Germany (2020-2022). This case study consists of two main parts: firstly, I trace the macro process of the creation of new, opposing, political identities (those in favour of Corona measures and vaccinations and the “Corona-deniers” and “anti-vaxxers”) by studying the political discourse of media and government outlets. Secondly, I investigate how “Corona” came to appear as a relevant criterion of distinction on a meso- and micro-level – and particularly in the social realm – by conducting interviews with individuals who show a strong degree of hostility towards “the other side”. In both parts, I pay particular attention to the process through which identities are constructed and by whom, how individuals conceive of their own political identity and that of others, the role and nature of emotions on each side and the interaction of those different elements.

By thus disentangling the different elements of affective polarisation, I aim to not only contribute to a better conceptual and empirical understanding of the dynamics at play but to also path the way for a more nuanced normative assessment of the phenomenon and its role in democratic theory and politics.",WZB Berlin Social Science Center,,,,,,,,WZB Berlin Social Science Center,,Lena Röllicke,,,,,,,,Lena Röllicke,,Cleavages,Conflict,Democracy,Political Psychology,Political Sociology,Identity,,,"Dynamics of affective polarisation – ideology, emotions and identity",https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65960&EventID=185
0,"In recent years populism seems to have transgressed (national) boundaries, reflected in a phenomenon dubbed transnational populism: “a dichotomic discourse in which ‘the transnational people’ are juxtaposed to ‘the elite’ primarily along the lines of a down/up antagonism in which ‘the transnational people’ is discursively constructed as a large powerless group through opposition to ‘the elite’ conceived as a small and illegitimately powerful group” (De Cleen, Moffit, Panayotu & Stavrakakis, 2020, p.153). While transnational populism is in principle about the connection of different people, research conducted thus far has mainly focused on elite manifestations of transnational populism. In this project we shift the focus back to the people and study the role of populist communication in uniting peoples across borders. 
We argue that the moral aspect in the populist frame – the moral root of the distinction between the nation’s “pure people” and the “corrupt elite” (Mudde, 2004) – is key. 
This moralization of an issue, or a conflict, cannot only appeal to (Lipsitz 2018) and convince voters and thus have mobilizing effects (Clifford and Jerit 2013; Jung 2020). It can also increase hostility towards others (Clifford 2019; Ryan 2014). The role of morality in populist communication is rarely studied (albeit see Bos & Minihold, 2021), but we argue that it is exactly this aspect of the populist frame that can unite different peoples, thereby constructing a transnational “people-as-underdog” (De Cleen, 2017). 
With this in mind, this study investigates the power of the moral populist frame in reducing cleavages between citizens. We investigate, in other terms, whether the polarizing effects of traditional conflicts and cleavages (religious, linguistic, regionalist, economic and cultural), which opens up rifts in evaluations between the in- and the out-group, can be reduced via the common support to the transversal “moral” conflict put forward in populist communication. We furthermore expect this to be particularly the case among voters showcasing high levels of populist attitudes (Akkerman et al., 2014; Castanho Silva et al., 2020), particularly susceptible to the moralizing arguments in populist communication. 
We test this expectation via novel experimental evidence gathered in representative samples of voters in four selected cases, representing as many typical examples of contexts in which “traditional” conflict lines are salient, focusing on Belgium, Spain, Northern Ireland and Switzerland (n = 8000). In each country we field the same experiment, with a diverse sample of respondents on each side of the conflict. The experiment will be a 1x2 between-subjects experiment in which respondents are exposed to elite communication in which the moralization of populism is either present or absent. Dependent variables are (1) salience of the “traditional” conflict line in the country (e.g., linguistic cleavage) and (2) support for people across that conflict line. Populist attitudes will be included as moderators.",University of Amsterdam,University of Amsterdam,,,,,,,University of Amsterdam,,Linda Bos,Alessandro Nai,,,,,,,Linda Bos,,Conflict,Populism,Communication,Experimental Design,,,,,Dynamics of moral populism across conflict lines,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64676&EventID=185
0,"Emerging literature on eco-social welfare states suggests that synergies exist between welfare and climate policy goals. In public attitudes, such synergies show up as ‘dual support’ for both welfare and climate policies, and they are argued to assist in the transformation to an ecologically sustainable welfare state. Empirical results suggest that such dual support is at its height in Nordic countries. However, it is not known whether such eco-social attitudinal patterns are associated with voting and party choice, making it unclear how much these attitudes have political importance. In this article, I combine insights from the eco-social welfare state literature with literature on vote choice and party families in Europe. My research questions are: 1) Do eco-social preferences affect vote choice, 2) Are there cross-national differences in how these preferences affect vote choice, and 3) Which party families do such effects or differences involve? I use the European Social Survey (2016) data from 23 countries to examine how support for welfare and climate policies are associated with voting for the main European party families. I model welfare preferences with two measures: deservingness of welfare target groups and attitudes towards the state as a provider of welfare. Climate preferences are measured with an index of climate policy attitudes. The data is analyzed using multinomial regression methods. 

My preliminary results  suggest that both welfare and climate stances are associated with vote choice. In general, climate policies seem to have similar associations with voting patterns as deservingness-related welfare opinions, whereas opinions on the role of state as provider of welfare are less connected with climate stances. The results highlight both similarities and large cross-national differences in how the two policy preferences are associated with voting. Overall, welfare and climate policy stances show strongest associations with vote choice in the Nordic countries, whereas the associations are smallest in Eastern Europe. The full analyses will compare how eco-social preferences affect voting for various party families. Theoretically, the results will indicate whether eco-social welfare states are in electoral demand, and point out electoral avenues on how such policies might materialize. The results also suggest how eco-social preferences may shape European party politics in the future. For welfare state scholars, the results indicate how climate-related opinions may shape traditional partisan support for welfare state policies.",University of Turku,,,,,,,,University of Turku,,Sami Mustikkamaa,,,,,,,,Sami Mustikkamaa,,Comparative Politics,Environmental Policy,Welfare State,Climate Change,Electoral Behaviour,,,,Eco-social welfare states and party choice in Europe: Support for climate and welfare policies and their associations with voting patterns,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65088&EventID=185
0,"The amount of scholarship regarding the argument articulation by interest groups has steadily increased over the past years. For Germany in particular, however, there is a strong imbalance regarding the interest groups examined. Most prior studies have focused on interest groups acting in the fields of economic and labour policy, fewer have researched stakeholders in foreign policy. Findings of these studies demonstrate that patterns of lobbying considerably differ between these groups. Yet, it is so far unknown how interest groups act on issues that lie at the intersection of these policy fields. Since stakeholders always represent social groups and their interests, the question of which of these stakeholders can or cannot successfully enforce their positions is also a question that touches on the important issue of the democratic quality of states.
This study contributes to closing this research gap by investigating the positions by interest groups and NGOs in the recent case of the German Supply Chain Act (“Lieferkettengesetz”) as a prime example of national foreign economic policy. Increasingly accessible documents of formerly unavailable interest group positions, as well as a vast coverage by the public and media alike, render this case study particularly useful to identifying common topics.
While following the bill’s policy process, we investigate the interest groups’ main positions in respect to the German Supply Chain Act, how these actors articulate them and how they ultimately find their way into the final legislative text.

While the causes, duration and intensity of the crisis are not unitary but variable, all affected countries and societies have had to cope with it and overcome it too. In this sense the crisis may be seen as a common denominator that distinguishes such countries/societies, alongside a set of other common features, from the rest of Europe. In particular, in the course of undergoing the crisis the affected societies have been additionally burdened by the wearing down of an indispensable quality for social life, namely of trust that is an essential value in itself and vital for social interaction. In support of this claim various measurements are available, which indicate that generalized as well as more specific political sensitive forms of trust has been faltering significantly during the crisis years.
My central aim then in this paper is to examine the relationship between socio-economic crisis and trust, with an emphasis in trust in government and political institutions. Specifically, to establish whether there is in fact a link between these variables, and if so to ponder on the challenge to overhaul the damage. In fact, this would be an imperative if recovery is to take place while the democratic features of Southern European countries are preserved. For these purposes, I draw from data collected in the context of the World Values Survey-wave 7 and the European Values Survey and from the Standard Eurobarometer.",University of the Peloponnese,,,,,,,,University of the Peloponnese,,Sokratis Koniordos,,,,,,,,Sokratis Koniordos,,Government,Institutions,Social Capital,Qualitative Comparative Analysis,Public Opinion,Southern Europe,Survey Research,Political Cultures,Economic Crisis and Shifts in Trust: Southern European Countries in Comparative Perspective,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64721&EventID=185
0,"The Brexit campaign claimed that by leaving the EU, the UK would ‘take back control’, not least by regaining control of immigration, freeing itself from unnecessary red tape and unnecessary regulation, and being able to  pursue its own trade deals. The campaign’s promise was that a free global Britain would be able to overcome Rodrik’s trilemma and reconcile globalisation, sovereignty, and democracy. Over a year after leaving the Single Market, the UK is now exposed to the fact that there is a tension between these three aims, and that economic integration has been weakened by the negotiated trade agreement.

0,"Academic and public discourse frequently emphasises the educational divisions on the exclusion of immigrants from social rights provision, i.e. welfare chauvinism, across Europe. From the perspective of self-interest, individuals in more privileged economic positions are expected to be less prone to welfare chauvinism. Thus, lower levels of real or perceived competition for rare resources may inoculate the higher educated against the preference to exclude immigrants. Other studies have contended that the role of differences in cultural ideology between the higher and the lower educated is the dispositive factor; the higher salience of pro-democratic and anti-authoritarian attitudes tends to prevent welfare chauvinism among the higher educated. These arguments are compelling, but this paper argues that the relationship between education and welfare chauvinism is more complex and that (changing) contexts matter too. To examine this missing link, I use time series of context indicators and individual-level data from the European Social Surveys of 2008–2009 and 2016–2017 to conduct multilevel analysis across 23 countries. Contrary to current thinking, the results reveal that a considerable proportion of the higher educated holds welfare chauvinist attitudes across European countries. The higher educated were even the main drivers in several countries for the slower decrease or faster increase of welfare chauvinism across time. The educational effect significantly varies across countries but not across time. Furthermore, cross-national variations in the effect of education on welfare chauvinism can be explained by self-interest and cultural ideology patterns. Countries with lower levels of economic affluence and higher levels of authoritarian norms tend to have overall smaller cleavages between higher and lower-educated individuals. Particularly, countries with decreasing levels of economic affluence faced higher levels of welfare chauvinism, particularly amongst the higher educated. For such countries, the results can be explained by the higher-educated individuals tending to feel more economic anxiety and adapting more to societal norms than their lower-educated counterparts. These results pose a puzzle for researchers that argue for higher education as a tool for liberalisation and demonstrate the importance of national contexts on the matter.",Universität Konstanz,,,,,,,,Universität Konstanz,,Gianna Maria Eick,,,,,,,,Gianna Maria Eick,,Citizenship,Cleavages,Migration,Social Welfare,Education,Comparative Perspective,Policy-Making,,Educational Cleavages on Welfare Chauvinism across Time – Does (Changing) Context Matter?,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64673&EventID=185

And within this conceptualization, understand if the Ecuadorian nature imparted is based on the understanding of citizenship as a national group of different ethnic groups and cultures based on the Ecuadorian territory, in which they have the possibility of accessing quality educational and health services. Or rather, it proposes a theoretical, philosophical and institutionalist approach far removed from the Ecuadorian reality regarding the exercise of citizenship. All this, under the complement of ethnographic work with young graduates from different educational centers from 2017, many of them former students of the researcher, in order to contrast the quality of this reform in the implementation in the classroom.

Regulation (EU) 2017/2226 of the European Parliament and of the Council was adopted on 30 November 2017 aims to replace the current manual system of passport stamps by more quickly detaining and identifying so-called ""overstayers"".
In turn, Portugal has an Immigration Law that, after the 2017 amendment, provides as a right the regularisation of the migratory status through the exercise of professional activity.

In this sense, the adequacy of the regularisation regime by way of labour instituted in Portugal in relation to the European policy of fight against illegal immigration will be legally analysed in order to verify if the compliance is possible through the valorisation of the principle of human dignity (labour dignity); or, if the securitisation processes of irregular immigration will lead to the limitation of the right to regularisation foreseen in the Portuguese legal system.",NOVA School of Law,,,,,,,,NOVA School of Law,,Emellin De Oliveira,,,,,,,,Emellin De Oliveira,,European Politics,Migration,Security,Constructivism,Technology,Big Data,,,EES and Irregular Labour workers in Portugal – a way towards the securitisation of human dignity?,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65402&EventID=185
0,"Paper aims to analyze the normative assumptions and the recent practice of public hearing in decision-making process in the Polish Parliament, being one of less investigated form the wide spectrum of participatory tools experimented in Poland in the last two decades.
Public hearing as a consultative, opinion sharing and informative mechanism was introduced in Polish Lower Chamber (Sejm) in 2006 resulting from NGO’s initiative to improve involvement of citizens in the law-making process. Respectively, the Senate adopted a similar arrangement into the inner regulation in 2013, as a facultative stage of procedure relating legislative proceeding.
The device using fluctuated over the time: from 2006 to 2017 have been proceeded 30 public hearings, while after 2018 none have been implemented, due to consequent rejection by majority in Lower Chamber committees. In contrast, in Senate a prior modest practice has showed increasing progresses and new significance (as a counterbalance mechanism to the governing majority). Moreover, the NGO’s have initiated to organize hearings concerning the most important to public opinion issues (fe. as a design of the Post-Covid New Recovery Plan) independently from MPs and beside of the parliament buildings.
The use of this particular tool of participatory democracy in Poland manifested its potential of shaping the institutional arrangements, but also showed the weaknesses of normative constructions and high fragility to the contextual factors.
In our analysis, we emphasize the question of measuring the effectiveness and efficiency of this normative tool by referring to the inclusiveness of marginalized or under-represented groups.

0,"Organizations connecting science and policy, referred to as science-policy interfaces, aim to support policymakers with decision-relevant knowledge and scientific findings. Given the rising significance of the role of evidence in decision-making in a world dealing with complex problems, a proliferation of literature has developed theories on the effectiveness of such interfaces. While there are studies providing evidence of these interfaces influencing policy, there is limited understanding on the comprehensive range of outcomes on policies among multiple science-policy interfaces. Through a systematic review, we analyzed how 69 research articles investigated the impacts on political decisions of structured science-policy interfaces related to environmental sustainability, organizing the types, effectiveness factors, outputs and impacts on political decisions of the interfaces observed. We found majority of the studies focused on global expert groups generating assessments leading to 26 occurrences of policy formulation and 12 occurrences to agenda setting, driven by the 53 instances of social learning among policymakers. There was a large proportion of references to stakeholder participation, diverse background of experts, interdisciplinarity, and the communication of complexity as factors enabling impacts on political decisions of science-policy interfaces. Further research is needed to explore the ‘fuzzy boundary’ between science and policy among different types of science-policy interfaces, the external forces influencing the relationship between SPI outputs and impacts on political decisions, and the interdependencies between effectiveness factors.

This paper introduces the development and features of the Stanford Online Deliberation Platform.

This paper focuses comparing the quality of deliberation in the online and in-person deliberative projects. In the past decades, deliberative democracy scholars empirically analysed the effects of deliberation among citizens using survey data from public deliberation events.

For this paper, we conduct content analysis using transcripts from two deliberative polls in Japan in 2012 and 2020. In 2012, randomly selected Japanese residents discussed future national energy policy face-to-face. Meanwhile, residents in Tokyo deliberated solar energy plans for 2030 via Stanford Online Deliberation Platform featuring an automated moderator in 2020.

Yet, fewer studies have investigated whether different instructional methods succeed in promoting political engagement among students from varying political socialization backgrounds. We use nationwide survey data of 15-16-year-old students (N=5,274) from Finland to demonstrate how implementing four different instructional methods in social studies lessons is associated with students' political engagement—measured as their political interest and willingness to participate and political efficacy. After controlling the students' political socialization background, our initial analyses show that frequent discussions about political issues and their solutions during the social studies lessons are efficient for all the students. However, they are even more beneficial for students from homes where political issues are seldom discussed. On the other hand, students who frequently discuss politics with their parents benefit more from learning through independent inquiry tasks than their peers from milder political socialization backgrounds. According to the initial results, frequent working on textbook tasks does not imply promoting students’ political engagement.

0,"Are reforms altering checks and balances evaluated differently depending on who proposes them? Coalitional affiliation is associated with how much importance citizens assign to different aspects of democracy: the winners of elections value elections more, while the losers of elections value constraints on executive power and opposition rights more (Mazepus & Toshkov 2021). Moreover, there is growing evidence that citizens in democracies evaluate violations of checks and balances differently depending on which party is responsible for them (e.g., Graham & Svolik 2020). Thus, just like other markers of coalition, political identity can drive citizens’ evaluations of information and their perceptions of objective facts (e.g., Leeper & Slothuus 2014). But why would this be the case? And should we expect that political identity affects evaluations of all proposals coming from the ruling elites? 
I study two complementary explanations of why citizens who declare high support for democracy vary in their evaluations of reforms of checks and balances.
First, I focus on the role of *perceived motivations* and test if coalitional cues influence what motivations citizens assign to the reformers. Following the reasoning that ‘The intentions of people on our team are pure; those of the out-group are not’ (Sloman & Rabb 2019), I expect that the losers of elections will be more suspicious of the intentions of the reformers. If an individual supports the coalition in charge, they will assign more benign intentions to the government proposing the reform: ensuring independence of judges, strengthening democracy and the rule of law. If an individual opposes the coalition in charge, they will assign more malicious intentions: undermining democracy, trying to get rid of the constraints on power.
Second, I focus on *the stakes* involved in reforms and test whether coalitional cues affect evaluations of all types of reform proposals. Thus, I investigate whether political identity activates motivated reasoning irrespective of the type of reform proposed or activates it only for high stakes reforms. I expect that the perception of being threatened by political rivals affects judgments of norm-eroding violations (Simonovits, McCoy, & Littvay 2021). As reforms altering checks and balances pose a threat to the election losers – their democratic rights might be constrained – the stakes in such reforms are high. We should therefore observe that coalitional cues have a larger effect on the perceived motivations of the reformers targeting checks and balances than domains that do not pose a direct threat to either coalition.
Empirically, I present the results of a pre-registered original survey experiment with a representative quota-based sample of Polish citizens (N = 1390). Using a mixed design, each participant was randomly assigned to a winning, losing or no coalition condition (between-subject) and evaluated four scenarios about proposed reforms (within-subject). Participants indicated perceived motivations (benign vs. malicious) of the reformers for  three types of checks and balances reforms (changes to the appointments of judges, removal of the presidential term limit, and new rules for protest registration) and a reform with lower stakes (changing the deadline for income-tax declaration).","Departments of Political Science and Public Administration, Universiteit Leiden",,,,,,,,"Departments of Political Science and Public Administration, Universiteit Leiden",,Honorata Mazepus,,,,,,,,Honorata Mazepus,,Europe (Central and Eastern),Democracy,Institutions,Political Psychology,Coalition,Experimental Design,,,Effects of coalitional cues on evaluations of reforms altering checks and balances,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63856&EventID=185
0,"The Covid-19 pandemic had closed public life and severely affected economic activities in many countries around the world. Where possible, governments forced or encouraged people to work from their homes to reduce contacts. Nevertheless, it affected economies everywhere and resulted in recessions in many countries. Consumption and demand decreased, supply chains were interrupted and international trade contracted. Although streets and malls were empty, commercial life did not come to a complete halt. A proportion of commerce moved online and jobs to people’s homes using internet connections. To keep this kind of economy going a certain amount of  information and communication technology (ICT) capacity is needed at all levels – state, business and people.

This paper builds on concepts like digitalisation and the digital divide to assess whether states and societies that are more ICT savvy weathered the Covid-19 storm better. Our hypothesis states that countries with better ICT capacity suffered less economic damage during the pandemic in 2020. To test the hypothesis we will model data from 150 countries. The dependent variable is the economic success which is measured by GDP growth in 2020. The main independent variable is ICT capacity, measured by using the Digital Access Index (DAI) developed by the World Bank. Control variables include GDP growth in the previous year (2019), severity of applied restrictions measured by the stringency index developed by the University of Oxford, growth in government debt in 2020, and exports of ICT services.",University of Tartu,,,,,,,,University of Tartu,,Raul Toomla,,,,,,,,Raul Toomla,,Political Economy,Internet,Regression,Empirical,,,,,Effects of Covid: digitalisation and economic growth during the pandemic,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63079&EventID=185
0,"Paper proposal for consideration for panel 3 on ‘Political Parties and Party Competition in Multilevel States’.
The main research objective of this paper is to introduce indicators that describe the most important characteristics of regional electoral systems. The need for such an exercise is based on three observations. First, the literature has largely ignored the impact of regional electoral systems. Second-order election and nationalization scholars use very crude and simple measures that tap whether proportional or majoritarian (or mixed) rules are applied in regional elections. Moreover, scholars have developed measures that are attuned to gauge differences between regional and national electoral systems rather than the characteristics of regional electoral rules. As a result, the impact of electoral rules on regional electoral outcomes have received scant attention in the literature.
Second, regional electoral systems have unique features that are not present in national and European electoral systems. For example, in Greece voters cast one vote which both determines the seat allocation in the council as well as which candidate will become the regional president. In addition, classifications based on national electoral systems do not lend themselves to assess electoral rules in a multilevel context and thereby are not suitable to study how electoral rules applied at one level impact electoral outcomes at another level. For example, in this paper we develop the concept of ‘the absolute vote threshold’ which is the total number of votes a candidate needs to obtain to win one seat. We argue that the ratio between absolute vote thresholds between regional, national, and European electoral arenas –i.e., how many more/less votes a candidate needs to gain representation in another electoral arena—is a key variable driving the extent of spill-over between electoral arenas. 
Third, national and European electoral systems can play out very differently across the statewide territory. For example, party competition in national elections held in Valle d’Aosta and the Åland islands boil down to a one- to two-party system even though proportional rule applies. Existing classifications of national and European electoral systems are not attuned to measure this regional variation. We argue that the relative size of a region vis-à-vis other regions in the state should be taken into account in the measurement of electoral rules translating votes into seat in order to better understand how electoral rules impact party competition at the regional level.
In this paper we start with a critical review of ‘methodological nationalism’ in electoral system research and we provide an in-depth discussion of the three caveats identified above. We then proceed by developing a set of indicators that are attuned to tap meaningful variation at the regional level and are suitable to probe multilevel electoral contextual variables that are thought to be conducive for vertical and horizontal electoral spill-over. The final section provides (descriptive) analyses to further expose and underline ‘methodological nationalism’ in electoral system research.",Universitetet i Bergen,Universitetet i Bergen,,,,,,,Universitetet i Bergen,,Arjan H.

0,"Politicians’ behavior in legislatures should reflect their electoral promises and policy goals outlined in their manifestos. This is important to ensure both representation and responsiveness in modern democracies. Yet, we do not know if, for instance, specific issues highlighted in election manifestos are of equal importance once the going gets tough in parliament. We investigate this campaign-parliamentary practice-nexus by focusing on the salience variation between election manifestos and parliamentary questions with regard to two prominent issues in the last years: migration and environmental policy. We apply an established dictionary on migration policy and a newly generated one on environmental policy and analyze the variations in 217 manifestos and approx. 17,000 parliamentary questions written and asked by established parties in 34 local councils in Germany (2011-2019). Our results demonstrate that both party- and coalition-level characteristics, as well as contextual factors play an important role for the explanation of the campaign-parliamentary practice-nexus. For example, parties owning an issue show larger congruence in salience levels regarding such issues than other parties. Furthermore, once parties enter a coalition and sign a coalition agreement, this campaign-parliamentary practice-nexus is weakened considerably.

0,"Based on a comparable set of indicators, we will examine how citizens perceived the integrity of the 2017 and 2021 German federal election. So far, there is very limited research on perceptions of Electoral Integrity in Germany, probably due to the fact that it has been taken for granted that the integrity of German elections was beyond question, and it was implicitly assumed that the electorate would see it the same way. However, the result of our research suggests that this view, at least recently, is no longer justified. Our analytical approach is exploratory and ""y-centered"": based on hypotheses that are discussed in the literature on the background of perceptions of electoral integrity, we want to investigate why most citizens attributed high procedural quality to the 2017 and 2021 federal elections, but a number that is by no means negligible saw it differently. Our paper will be structured as follows: First of all, we successively discuss a number of hypotheses about the possible backgrounds of perceptions of the integrity of the Bundestag election and test them in corresponding partial models. Finally, we check the robustness of the relationships found in this way using an integrated overall model. Our results show that there is a close connection between satisfaction with democracy and the perception of electoral integrity; but other indicators of (dissatisfaction) satisfaction - political as well as economic - also prove to be robust predictors. In addition, the use of political information from certain media sources is also related to the judgments of the citizens about the quality of the electoral process.

We consider this framework limited because it assumes that losses and gains affect a party's decision-making process in a comparable way, and because it assumes that the decision-making process of clientelist political parties focuses only on absolute levels of utility while overlooking changes in outcomes with respect to a reference point. We hypothesize that parties are risk-averse in the domain of gains and risk-seeking in the domain of losses—i.e., losing an election hurts more than winning an election pleases. Unlike traditional theories of clientelism, we argue that vote buying is most likely when parties are probable winners or have experienced important losses in the past.

0,"The question how municipal amalgamations influence voter turnout is for long time present in studies of local politics.

These studies clearly show that amalgamation causes decrease in electoral turnout. However, factors moderated the effect remains largely neglect. In this paper, centre-periphery relations are included as such factor. The basic hypothesis suggests that turnout should decrease especially in peripheral units. Periphery is measured by 3 ways – whether a unit host municipal office or not, what services are provided by municipality in the unit, and by size of the unit. In this paper we analyze data from the sub-municipal level of amalgamated municipalities in the 2010–2018 Czech local elections.

0,"We develop and test an explanation of the impact of decision-makers on government policy in Australia. An election pledge is a promise made a party during an election campaign to take a specific and verifiable policy action if it enters government. Ministers in particular are generally expected to influence the fulfilment of election promises that fall under their policy jurisdictions. In addition to adapting to new circumstances, reshuffles initiated by PMs indeed also allow them to punish poor ministerial performance. Ministers’ preferences on those election pledges derive both from their affinity with the ideological position of their parties and the extent to which pledges are congruent with those ideological positions. Their standing in the party, political experience and policy-area expertise further affect their incentives and capacity in implementing their party’s electoral promises.

We test our hypotheses regarding the make-up of the government and the individual characteristics of decision-makers using new collected data on the fulfilment of abut 600 election pledges made by Australian government and opposition parties (2010-2019). Australia largely operates as a two-party system but Coalition governments (2013-2019) are effectively made of two parties (Liberals and Nationals). Both sides of the aisle are made of disciplined yet factionalised parties.

0,"One of Zimbabwe’s most accomplished women politicians, Joice Mujuru, has held positions of member of parliament, minister and vice-president of the country. However, perceptions about her power to influence decisions in a context characterised by dominant ‘Big men’ have led to her elite status being the subject of debate among feminists, political activists and other women politicians. Some of her critics viewed her political elite status as dependent on the influence of her husband, the late Solomon Mujuru, who was considered one of the most powerful men in Zimbabwean politics and was often referred to as the kingmaker. Joice Mujuru’s loss of political power only a few years after her husband’s death seems to support this view. For some feminists, Joice Mujuru represented mere patriarchal interests. She was sometimes labelled part of ‘window-dressing’ designed by male elites who wished to give the misleading impression that they included women in power centres. When speaking about her experience as a politician, Joice Mujuru indicates that many factors limited her ability to influence decisions. These factors include her military training, which made her less inclined to challenge authority; her age and cultural background, which made her less inclined to challenge her elders; characters of her seniors who were not willing to take advice from their subordinates; her gender and her reluctance to cause ‘misunderstandings’ by being seen as too ambitious in a context characterised by long tenures and limited circulation of top-level political leaders. In this paper, I trace the various debates and ideas surrounding Joice Mujuru’s position in Zimbabwean politics by looking at history books and other scholarly sources, news media, documentaries, biographical films, published biographies, and recorded interviews to demonstrate the need for a sociometric elite theory that takes into account the positions of women in African politics. Unlike their male counterparts, the ‘Big men’ who are often simultaneously politicians, community leaders, and businessmen, women lack the resources to distribute and exchange for political support and secure and maintain their influence. Combinations of positional, decisional and reputational research methods and generally accepted definitions of political elites that consider individuals’ and groups’ disproportionate power to affect national political outcomes on a continuing basis may not be adequate to fully capture the experiences of women political elites in Africa because of elite women’s complex relationships with dominant masculine political networks and non-elites. Joice Mujuru, whose political legitimacy is primarily derived from her participation in Zimbabwe’s anti-colonial struggle, exemplifies the experiences of many African women in politics who often gain access to political positions during moments of transition, instability, political uncertainty, or crisis but find themselves being pushed to the margins of power in times of relative stability or treated as patronage networks or beneficiaries of state policies rather than agents in constructing new states.",Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies,,,,,,,,Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies,,Norita Mdege,,,,,,,,Norita Mdege,,Africa,Elites,Gender,Political Leadership,Feminism,Decision Making,Power,Influence,"Elite women, power and window-dressing in African politics",https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=66040&EventID=185
0,"Elites engage in a variety of causes from philanthropy and charity to human rights and environmental protection. Building on Bourdieu’s vocabulary of capital, field, and habitus, this paper maps the civil society engagement of the Swedish elite 1997-2007 by using data from the two most recent editions of the Swedish Who’s Who (1997 and 2007). Using the Who’s Who as a proxy for the elite, the study applies Social Network Analysis and similar methods in order to show the composition and integration of the Swedish elite in civil society. The paper finds that the elite exhibits characteristic patterns: Organizationally, the elite is divided in two: A large cluster mainly integrated through political positions, and a smaller cluster integrated through organizations built on a Christian foundation. A Sequence Analysis reveals different career paths of the elite: While some built their position through civil society organizational capital, for others the affiliation to certain civil society organizations reads like a form of symbolic ‘consecration’.",Lunds Universitet,,,,,,,,Lunds Universitet,,Anders Sevelsted,,,,,,,,Anders Sevelsted,,Elites,Governance,Political Economy,Political Sociology,Mixed Methods,NGOs,Political Activism,Power,Elites in civil society: mapping the pattern of the Swedish elite’s civil society positions through social network analysis (1997-2007),https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64340&EventID=185
0,"I compare the response of three major actors, the public, the media, political elites in Romania and the US to the Covid-19 pandemic – a “most different systems design”. In both cases, the cumulative effect of (1) an inappropriate level of scientific and civic education of the public, (2) a dishonest and irresponsible position of a significant part of the media, and (3) the public positions vis-à-vis, and management of, the Covid-19 pandemic by the government have made things much worse than they could have been. The reaction of these actors in the aforementioned countries is in stark contrast to what they were in countries that have done a much better job in managing the pandemic. My paper will also highlight how these actors often learned from one another, not always from the same type of actor, and often in a pernicious way. To give just one example, in mid-July 2020 then-President Donald gave an interview to Chris Wallance on Fox News, where he claimed that the Covid-19 pandemic in the US was getting better. As evidence, he showed a graph where the Case Fatality Rate (the ratio between confirmed deaths and confirmed cases) was going down. Less than a week later, the exact same argument was repeated by a journalist from Antena 3, the functional equivalent of Fox News in Romania. Obviously, both the number of deaths and the number of infections can go up (which they were, in both US and Romania). However, the rate of increase in the former (i.e., deaths) was less than the rate of increase in the latter (cases). Consequently, CFR was going down in both countries.",Babeş-Bolyai University,,,,,,,,Babeş-Bolyai University,,Florin Fesnic,,,,,,,,Florin Fesnic,,Public Policy,Comparative Perspective,Public Opinion,Political Cultures,,,,,"Elites, media, civic and scientific education, and response to Covid-19 in the US and Romania",https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65361&EventID=185
0,"Democratic innovations (Smith 2009) are gaining ground around the world and across different polities from the local to the EU level. Whilst there is currently much focus on the role that deliberative mini-publics can play to help address issues of polarisation and decreasing legitimacy of representative institutions, other democratic innovations, such as participatory budgeting or coproduction, also continue to grow in popularity to connect the voices of everyday people to decision-makers. Several criticisms have been levelled against many of these often top-down approaches to public participation, which are often conceived in terms of ancillary, consultative spaces, with limited impact on decisions, and which risk being perceived as apolitical remedial action, encouraging citizen mobilisation focused around short-term, often individualised, action and premised on fragmented participation (Lee et al. 2015; Pateman 1970). Even where there is a political will to genuinely engage with citizen input, efforts at translating ad hoc citizen participation into actual policy change often clash against organisational cultures and capacity which limits citizen influence. This paper presents the findings from a scoping review of recent academic and grey literature (2010-2020) and a series of expert interviews to reflect on recent developments towards embedding participatory governance, with a focus on the impact of rapid digitalisation and bottom up processes through civic tech or the commons. We find that the growing numbers of democratic innovation designs continue to encounter the same socio-economic, administrative and political barriers to meaningful participation. This demands a deeper understanding of interactions and flow of power across different participatory spaces, digital and analogue, top down and bottom up, taking a more systemic lens. The most recent practice shows how practitioners and activists are starting to take a systemic approach to participatory design that shifts the focus from isolated spaces and initiatives to a participatory infrastructure that aims to democratise not only political institutions, but also the economy and the wider society.",Manchester Metropolitan University,Manchester Metropolitan University,,,,,,,Manchester Metropolitan University,,Sonia Bussu,yaron golan,,,,,,,Sonia Bussu,,Democracy,Institutions,Political Participation,,,,,,Embedding participatory governance: taking a systemic perspective,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64125&EventID=185
0,"Decades of research have brought a rich body of literature on the challenges and opportunities to promote energy transitions in the Global South. Scholars have engaged with the adoption of policy mechanisms like feed-in tariffs, investigated the implementation of technological innovations such as solar power, and formulated critiques towards development cooperation that failed to deliver sustainable and long-lasting clean energy interventions. Yet, the literature says little about the nexus between donor interventions, subnational political frameworks, and social contexts in which these projects are embedded. Therefore, we turn our attention to the embeddedness of donor-driven interventions through the lens of political institutionalization. Our contribution is twofold: (1) Conceptually, we propose and apply a framework to unpack the potentials and pitfalls for development cooperation to promote and sustain climate mitigation institutions in the Global South. To do so, we marry earlier research dealing with donor-driven energy transitions in the Global South with conceptual reflections on complex policy arrangements and political institutionalization in environmental politics. (2) Empirically, we adapt this literature to the context of donor-driven solar power interventions in India and Indonesia. Through a small-n qualitative approach, we present and discuss various solar power projects as illustrative cases for the success and failure to institutionalize these efforts. 

To sustain effects beyond initial donor support, any project intervention from abroad needs to trigger and support the development of context-specific and embedded climate institutions. The sociopolitical embeddedness of climate mitigation efforts depends on changes at three levels which we will investigate here. They need to tackle, reform, and trigger shifts related to existing (1) policies (in terms of implementation, integration, and instruments), (2) power relations (in terms of responsibilities, organizational structures, and resources), and (3) discourses (in terms of norms, ideas, and perceptions). Based on qualitative insights from solar power projects in India and Indonesia, we explore, trace, and critically reflect on how donors tackle these dimensions. Recognizing the micro-macro paradox in development cooperation, we focus on subnational jurisdictions which we consider crucial in connecting national policy frameworks with local contexts and conditions. Successful institutionalization at the subnational level can function as a testing ground for alternatives to the status quo in terms of political reforms and innovations towards low carbon development. Subnational contexts thus provide useful microcosms for experimentation and learning. We conclude that any (technical) development cooperation aiming to promote climate mitigation efforts beyond the donor-funded project phase needs to consider subnational political contexts and circumstances more seriously to institutionalize changes towards clean energy systems.",Technische Universität Darmstadt,Technische Universität Darmstadt,,,,,,,Technische Universität Darmstadt,,Markus Lederer,Jens Marquardt,,,,,,,Jens Marquardt,,Asia,Development,Green Politics,Institutions,Climate Change,Domestic Politics,Power,Energy,Embedding the energy transition in the Global South: an institutional challenge for donor-driven interventions,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64271&EventID=185
0,"Since 1990s, the key formula of political economy of developed countries became globalization. This became also one of the major legitimizing narratives of neoliberal capitalism which became widely perceived as the only game in town. The necessity to adapt to international markets became both desirable and only possible policy (Streeck). Also the progressive political forces accepted the globalizing capitalism as inevitable and natural process without any alternative. The quick deregulation, increased mobility of capital and re-commodification of labor led to rising political conflict between the citizens in nation states and representatives of international markets.
This was the context of international political economy to which post-socialist countries were thrown after 1989. While Western countries experienced rather continuous development towards a new neoliberal order (after having located markets in states and maintaining redistributive policies after the world war), Eastern Europe experienced a sudden fall of rigid state socialism which was immediately followed by more or less intensive economic “shock therapy”. Establishment and rise of capitalist economy here had been incredibly dynamic and overwhelming. Particularly Czechoslovak transition from centrally planned to market economy was one of the fastest among post-socialist states.
Not only the citizens of recently transformed countries started to orient themselves in the new political and economic reality, but also new civil society actors emerged and started to confront and contest new social and economic conditions. Even if the expected widespread popular unrest did not take place as expected (Greskovits), collective actors started to organize various public events while making claims to political authorities or business. 
This paper focuses on a detailed analysis of evolution of this new collective action field arising to challenge the consequences of new economic order. It conceptualizes this field in relational perspective as having two dimensions. First, regular co-organizing of protest events by multiple collective entities (i.e. sharing goals, resources and strategies among multiple organizers) produces protest communities (Diani) – alternatively organizations remain isolated in their claim-making. Second, the very same public protests link into campaigns - networks of events linked by coordination efforts of same collective actors with same or similar claims – alternatively these events stand on their own. The aim of the paper is to analyze these two aspects of collective action field separately, yet acknowledging their structural reciprocity. Using SNA, the paper asks: what is the fragmentation and dis/-continuity of both protest communities and campaigns of economic collective action field over last three decades? How does their structure relate to changing political (POS), political-economic (transformation of economy) and economic (grievances) context? And what factors determines the importance of collective actors in protest communities, and the importance of events in protest campaigns?

0,"There has been in the last years a growing interest among scholars in understanding 'influence operations' conducted by foreign states to steer the public opinion in their favour. Russia is often described as one of the main instigators, purportedly using a wide array of alternative media and establishing 'troll factories' to target online discussions. This proposed paper employs a mixed-method approach to understand the leading narratives that inform the pro-Russian discourse on a social media platform together with its influence. The original material was collected in September and October 2020, and it is constituted by over 6000 original Tweets and about 32000 retweets, written in Italian, discussing events related to Russia. By computing an edge list of the relations between Tweeting accounts and retweeters, it was possible to construct a directed network graph of all accounts involved in the discussion and identify those actors who display consistent pro-Russian views based on their mutual interactions. Indeed, the Louvain community detection algorithm defined the existence of three well-defined communities: pro-Russian, criticisers of Russia, and impartial media accounts. SNA influence measures (such as Indegree, hubs and authorities, and HITS) indicate the pro-Russian network as the most influential of the three.
Moreover, a hashtag frequency analysis was performed to gain insight into the topics discussed by the different clusters. Unsurprisingly, the two communities returned vastly different focuses on discussion topics, hinting once again at the evident polarisation of discourse on social media platforms. In particular, the pro-Russian cluster displays narratives based on conspiracies and self-victimisation. Moreover, a qualitative discourse analysis of pro-Russian Tweets further revealed how currently unfolding political events tend to be discussed in the same way, by employing the same kind of narrative that sees a culturally decadent West in an all-camp fight against a resurging Russia, described in the tweets as a civilisational model. The analysis will display a series of such examples to understand better how this occurs and explore the possible implications, as the narratives presented easily feed into broader far-right stances.

0,"Within the framework of the research project “Asserting the Nation: comparative studies on the rise of neo-nationalism in higher education”, this paper will discuss empirical data collected in France during the spring 2022. As witnessed in several European countries (e.g. Van der Wende, 2021; Brøgger 2021), the effects of emerging neo-nationalist trends have been unfolding in three main areas of higher education: institutional governance, international engagement and academic freedom. This presentation of the French case will focus on the latter, with the intent to explore recent developments observed in the government’s discourse on academic freedom and their ramifications within the higher education system. 
With the term “neo-nationalism”, the social anthropologists Andre Gingrich and Mark Banks (2006) sought to define those “new and recent variants of nationalism” (p.2) that most scholarly works had been labelling as “new-right” forces. According to Gingrich, these emerging parties shared a distinct hostility towards EU authorities, a common anti-immigrant platform and related “pro-law-and-order elements” (Gingrich, 2006, p. 215). Later works have added to Gingrich’s conceptualisation, highlighting how neo-nationalist forces have now shifted from an anti-welfare position towards the economic left, embracing welfare chauvinism (Eger and Valdez, 2015). Underlying the few features listed above, is the core element of national identity and the desire to preserve what is held to be constitutive of this identity. 

During the last two years, French academics have been increasingly targeted by political figures – including high-ranking government officials – accusing universities of working against the unity and values of the Republic. Whereas most commentators interpreted the government’s discursive shift as part of a broader electoral strategy, a more in-depth enquiry was deemed necessary. The study relies on qualitative interviews with representatives of both government bodies and higher education institutions in order to understand how policy officials working within and on behalf of the ministries articulate their discourse on academic freedom and how they perceive its role in connection to the values – and interests – of the Nation. Concurrently, interviews conducted within higher education institutions aimed to measure the ramifications of the government’s discourse as they are perceived by academics themselves.

Coupled by extensive policy document analysis, qualitative interviewing was planned in close cooperation with the research group, aiming to work within a coherent comparative framework, grounded on a relational and context-sensitive approach (Valimaa and Nokkala, 2014). Through an examination of the discourses around academic freedom in France, the paper will shed light on the extent to which neo-nationalist trends are able to develop within long-established liberal democracies and under the auspices of governing parties that are far from being categorized – and even less define themselves - as nationalist.",Aarhus Universitet,,,,,,,,Aarhus Universitet,,Ester Zangrandi,,,,,,,,Ester Zangrandi,,Nationalism,Policy Analysis,Higher Education,Liberalism,,,,,Emerging neo-nationalist trends in contemporary liberal democracies: empirical findings on academic freedom in France,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64650&EventID=185

With the Europe fit for a digital age strategy and its derivative policies, the balance between regulation and innovation, and with an embedded and recognisable code of ethics towards the development and deployment of AI, are sought. As a political process, or a set of processes, this not only means a massive effort by the Union towards creating new legislative measures and activities, but also reaches beyond the EU borders and establishes the EU as an ethically ambitious actor in multilevel governance of digitalisation. Furthermore, through activities related to the digital strategy, actors across sectors are brought together to have an impact on the way the EU is proceeding with the strategy. This paper focuses on the EU digital strategy as a lens to discuss the role of democracy as part of the EU ethos and politics. More specifically, it asks how democracy is articulated as part of the EU stand on digitalisation, and who are the key agents recognised as part of the strategy and policy. Using the approach familiar from studying political concepts, the paper investigates a wide selection of EU documents and reports, and discusses these from the perspective of emerging technologies as tools and objects of politics in global governance.

0,"Governments around the world are starting to make concrete efforts to deploy carbon dioxide removal (CDR) portfolios, consistent with their commitments to achieve net-zero emissions by mid-century. The UK, Sweden, and Norway, for instance, have proactively addressed geochemical- and ecosystem- based methods to achieve their emission targets. The Swiss federal and local governments are also deciding on the role of geological and natural sinks, as well as building materials to reduce hard-to-abate emissions in its aim to get to net-zero emissions by 2050. Defining the role of CDR within each country’s pathway is complex, as it requires deciding choosing options, such as biochar and direct air capture and storage, that are embedded in different knowledge systems, where issues such as the relationship with communities and accounting challenges differ greatly. At the same time, some methods depend on the same energy, infrastructural or natural resources and therefore cannot be looked at independently. Divergent stakeholders’ views on how to “best” get to net-zero can lead to competition for resources, conflict between policy proponents and delay in decisions.

Our study analyzes the emerging discourses shaping the role of CDR in the climate policy of Switzerland. It presents a discourse analysis of a set of interviews, reports, and policy texts, exploring the visions on the problem to tackle using CDR and proposed approaches to do so. Our analysis shows areas where knowledge systems around different methods compete or converge in the CDR governance debate. We find out that there are divergencies in the problem to be tackled, with carbon mitigation being the main goal of technological solutions proponents and a co-benefit for natural-solutions proponents. We also observe a trend from considering methods independently to recognizing the need for portfolios and an increasing focus on shared resources needed by different methods.

Our work sheds light on how the architecture of CDR options has evolved in the last years and how different knowledge systems influence and collide in the CDR governance debate. This study adds to the emerging body of work using discursive structures as a tool for anticipating how CDR governance may develop, by revealing the circumstances and discursive structures that shape the governance purposes and objects that are thinkable and practicable in Switzerland.",ETH Zürich,,,,,,,,ETH Zürich,,Juanita von Rothkirch,,,,,,,,Juanita von Rothkirch,,Conflict,Democracy,Policy Analysis,Public Policy,Knowledge,Energy Policy,Policy-Making,,Emerging tensions in the path towards net-zero: Swiss stakeholders’ perspectives on carbon dioxide removal,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64880&EventID=185
0,"The power of emotion in mass mobilization was a key ingredient in the Chinese Communists’ revolutionary victory, and remains central to party-state propaganda in post-Mao China (Perry,2002). The wide-scale patriotic education campaign launched shortly after the Tiananmen Incident is one example (Wang 2012). Under Xi Jinping, patriotism/nationalism has become a priority for ensuring regime legitimacy, social integration, and ‘harmony’ (Guo 2019). One key strategy of Xi’s deployment of emotional rhetoric has been his adoption of a vocabulary of family and traditional family values to evoke support for and identification with the nation-state. He has repeatedly called on citizens to unify their love for family with love for the nation through his promotion of ‘family and nation sentiment’ (jiaguo qinghuai) and his call for the ‘Construction of Family Values (jiafeng jianshe)’. Meanwhile, however, empirical evidence reveals an increased tolerance of different lifestyles among China’s citizens and an ongoing transformation of family practices, evinced by pre-marital cohabitation, later marriage, extra-marital affairs, more divorce and reshaped norms of filial piety (Yan 2021). Bringing together insights on the political mobilization of emotion (Goodwin et al. 2001; Thompson and Hoggett2012) with theories of gender and nation (Yuval-Davis 1997, 2011), and critical perspectives on heterosexuality (Jackson 2006, 2019) and Asian familialism (Ochiai 2014), this paper establishes familial nationalism as a theoretical framework to analyse the multi-layered implications of the emotionalization of Xi’s propaganda work.

0,"Scholarly interest in the link between emotions and collective action has been increasing in the last two decades. Once considered irrational and irrelevant, emotions have been acknowledged as significant components of collective action by social movement scholars recently. Several studies argue that emotions have important roles in processes such as collective action participation, collective identity formation and demobilization. Still, the consequences of the collective emotional experiences in the aftermath of protests have yet to be developed. Aiming at contributing to this debate, we analyze the case of the 2013 Gezi Park Protests in Turkey and investigate the biographical consequences of collectively experienced emotions during this event. Using methodological triangulation, we first examine the diffusion of emotions in online social networks during protest events using Twitter data. Next, we delve into the consequences of the emotional experiences of the activists using semi-structured in-depth interviews. The preliminary findings demonstrate that the intense feeling of shared emotional synchronization among participants, which is known as collective effervescence, has significant short- and long-term results. Our analysis indicates that the collective effervescence was associated with the increased spread of messages on social media platforms during the protests. Besides, as a unique eventful protest with the characteristics of a critical juncture for Turkish politics, the shared emotional experience and collective synchronization during the Gezi Park Protests had significant biographical consequences for the participants particularly regarding their perception of the participant social groups and their political activities in the aftermath of the protests. Consequently, analyzing the emotional components of collective action, we intend to contribute to the social movement studies by introducing a mechanism for the biographical consequences of (eventful) protests.",Scuola Normale Superiore,Koç University,,,,,,,Scuola Normale Superiore,,Batuhan Eren,Gunes Ertan,,,,,,,Batuhan Eren,,Political Psychology,Social Movements,Identity,Activism,,,,,Emotions and Collective Action: Diffusion in Social Networks and Biographical Outcomes,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63585&EventID=185
0,"Legislative public testimony is a cornerstone of the deliberative elements of American democracy, particularly at the state level. Public testimony also often encompasses high conflict policy debates, particularly when legislation touches on morally contentious, highly polarized, emotionally laden public policy issues. While high conflict policy debates are routinely studied using the Advocacy Coalition Framework and Discourse Network Analysis, the role of emotions in these contests often remain in the background analytically. Actors engaged in public testimony express a range of emotions related to their moral positions on policy issues, and to their allies, opponents, and public officials. 

We analyze how policy actors in advocacy coalitions use implicit and explicit emotions on morally complex issues across legislative testimony on ten bills. These issues encompass education, housing, criminal justice, LGBTQ+, and reproductive justice legislation. This sample includes bills that both passed and failed during the 2021 Colorado Legislative session, and explores how emotions influence this success or failure of legislation. The testimony across these ten bills, along with in-depth, semi-structured interviews form a purposive sample of actors engaged in public testimony and deliberative democracy.  

We find that actors use a wide range of emotions, both explicitly and implicitly, in reaction to events that occur before and during the testimony debate and the actions and beliefs of other actors. They also use emotions to emphasize frames that support their moral and policy preferences, which can aid in both coalition building and contributing to resistance from opponents. Additionally, actors explicitly describe the emotions of themselves and their allies more frequently than the emotions of their opponents. This work contributes to the field by building on the literature on policy conflicts, advocacy coalitions, and deepening understanding of how actors use emotion in policy conflicts, specifically through the examination of public testimony.

0,"In September 2020, Hungary’s populist prime minister Viktor Orbán self-confidently said in a radio interview that “the success of the defense [against the pandemic] can be measured by the number of deaths and lives saved”, clearly determining the criteria of evaluating the performance of his government’s crisis management. In 2022, statistics show that Hungary had registered one of the highest death toll rates per 100,000 capita in global comparison during the Covid-19 pandemic, surpassing the number of casualties in less developed countries where the quality of the health care service is much lower by all metrics.  

Hungary, under Viktor Orbán’s leadership, presents a prime example of a populist, semi-authoritarian regime where democracy had eroded in the past 10 years. The Covid-19 outbreak presented a unique challenge to the populist government that had previously had not had to handle any major crises apart from the short-lived migration crisis in 2015, which Orbán had successfully used to advance his politics of democratic backsliding. During the migration crisis, Orbán utilized to the maximum the anti-elitist argument to undermine public trust in the European Union and secure public approval of his undemocratic policy measures. As expected, Orbán turned to the populist rhetorical toolkit again when the Covid-19 pandemic erupted.

This paper will explore how Viktor Orbán utilized the “us vs them” populist narrative and the method of enemy creation to fasten the dismantling of democratic institutions and to disguise his government’s apparent failures in handling the pandemic, at the same time. Various communicative processes and discursive U-turns will be presented and critically examined to provide an insight into the practical application of a political style that many scholars define as intrinsic to populism. These will then be contextualized with the government’s pandemic policy measures to make a broader analysis possible into the process of democratic erosion in Hungary. Next, the paper will showcase opinion polls and vaccination statistics to argue that Orbán’s populist narrative had clearly failed to deliver the short-term political results that he had expected. Contrarily, his political messaging contributed to a great extent to the spread of vaccine-skepticism in particular and the anti-science mobilization in general within the public transforming a country that had previously been famous for its pro-science population into one where trust in science diminished and the traditionally high societal prestige of scientists was damaged.

The critical examination in this paper intends to reveal the limits of the effectiveness of the “us vs. them” narrative when a populist-led government faces unforeseen crises. Furthermore, it will present a case that underlines the detrimental effects of the populist “us vs. them” dichotomy on the public trust in science, an important part of the process of democratic erosion.",Social Development Institute,,,,,,,,Social Development Institute,,Krisztian Szabados,,,,,,,,Krisztian Szabados,,Democracy,Populism,Knowledge,Public Opinion,,,,,Enemies everywhere: the limits of the populist anti-elitist narrative during the Covid-19 pandemic.

A variety of circular initiatives have emerged, which in their everyday practices aim to increase their circular impact.  We approach transformative change as a continuous process through which emerging circular initiatives, so-called small wins, accelerate. This paper explores what mechanisms drive these processes and, more in particular, how circular initiatives stay or become more transformative while accelerating? Building on existing literature about mechanisms that contribute to the spreading, deepening, and broadening of small wins – we further develop a framework that focuses on the interplay between mechanisms. We conceptually argue and empirically illustrate how deepening the circularity of small wins takes place through learning by doing; how the spreading of small wins takes place through professionalization and how broadening the scope of small wins to other domains takes place through partnering. We applied this framework to two illustrative cases in the Netherlands: circular laying-hen farm, Kipster, and the community farming initiative, Herenboeren.

0,"Major recurring themes in energy transitions revolve around questions of energy justice: how ills and benefits are distributed, how processes of energy choices are organized and who is recognized as a legitimate voice in these choices (and how) (Jenkins et al., 2016). In this research, we aim to apply the concept of energy justice and broaden it, by involving citizens in these considerations of justice. In participation trajectories in the energy transition in the Netherlands, citizens are frequently asked to distribute technical aspects in relation to the spatial quality of their region. A current omission in these mapping assignments are socio-economic factors, which is potentially problematic considering that economically disadvantaged regions, neighborhoods and individuals are at higher risk in relation to social, technical, and financial burdens (Jenkins et al., 2016; Walker & Day, 2012). Cartographic reflections should not focus exclusively on a physical rendering, but that it should raise questions involving the rendering of social significance, possibly by looking at areas traditionally quite alien to its fields, such as the language of technical and visual arts (Casti, 2015). Therefore, we make use of mapping assignments in deliberative sessions, charting how groups of citizens discuss and design aspects of energy justice. By doing so, we answer the question: ‘What is the role of distributive mapping assignments during a deliberative session with local stakeholders and citizens to create a more just energy transition?’. During several deliberative sessions at different locations, citizens living in the Province of Overijssel in the Netherlands are asked to reflect on interactive regional maps to discuss the energy transition in their own region. Through the three tenets in energy justice (i.e., distributive, procedural, recognition, Jenkins et al., 2016) we analyze how citizens use elements of justice to design a just energy transition.",Wageningen University and Research Center,Wageningen University and Research Center,,,,,,,Wageningen University and Research Center,,Bart Haagsma,Simone Haarbosch,,,,,,,Simone Haarbosch,,Methods,Climate Change,Decision Making,Empirical,Energy Policy,,,,Energy justice through mapping: exploring distributive aspects in citizen mapping assignments,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63161&EventID=185
0,"Populist politics in East Central Europe, especially in its guise of right-wing or national populism, is generally considered challenging the policies of sustainable transformations to climate-neutral societies and economies. We consider this region of special attention due to democratic backsliding tendencies and resilience towards the EU and its role in the green transformation. Green New Deal bringing among many other goals socially just change to the region with energy legacy based on fossil fuel industry that has been heavily supplied with material from Soviet Union, in particular from Russia. 
This paper takes the popular representation and understanding of energy resources as the source of tension between politics defined as reactionary populism and progressive reformism in order to define the energy populism. Basing the empirical analysis on content analysis of  parliamentary debates about energy transformation, green technologies, and energy transportation and on the ethnography of popular ambivalence towards sustainable sources of energy, this paper partly explains why it is worth looking at exceptionally positive attitudes of Slovaks towards Russia of Vladimir Putin, the dominant provider of energy resources to the country, not only from the view of reactionary ideologies, propaganda, and national romanticism but from the perspective of what we understand as the energy populism, the popular practice, understanding, and typology of the natural resources after state-socialism.

0,"The issue of energy poverty has gained increasing attention at the EU level, being referenced in various energy-related legislation and initiatives. Two prominent examples are the Clean Energy for All Europeans Package (Directive (EU) 2018/2002) and the proposed European Green Deal. In the academic literature, energy/fuel poverty has a longer history. Much of this research focuses on theorizing the phenomenon, its conceptualization and operationalization, and individual or small-N comparative case studies. While it is broadly accepted that energy poverty is a multidimensional phenomenon with various causes, with a few exceptions larger-scale comparative studies analyzing the diversity of drivers across the EU appear to be lacking. Given the issue’s increasing relevance for EU energy policy, such a study would seem to be of critical importance. Applying fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis, this thesis attempts to fill this gap by identifying the various combinations of conditions driving the phenomenon (and its absence) across the EU. The results suggest a strong role for social policy in terms of protection benefits and housing in driving the outcome as well as its absence. Such findings have important implications for both EU and national-level policy aimed at addressing the issue as well as for broader energy-related initiatives and concerns, particularly energy transition and energy justice.",Masaryk University,,,,,,,,Masaryk University,,Colin Kimbrell,,,,,,,,Colin Kimbrell,,European Union,Public Policy,Social Justice,Qualitative,Energy Policy,,,,Energy Poverty across the European Union: An fsQCA Analysis of Causal Pathways,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=66500&EventID=185
0,"Although significantly understudied in IPE and IR, energy is at the start of a profound, large-scale global transformation that will take decades to complete and that is heterogenous, contested, and uncertain in its details and shape. Our interest here in developing a better understanding of the global energy transformation by re-thinking energy geopolitics. Energy geopolitics (GE) is a useful starting point for exploring large-scale change as it has a lot to tell us about the make-up of current energy systems and their important geopolitical outcomes, whilst renewable energy geopolitics (GRE) can tell us about what the international politics of future, renewable based, energy systems might look like. Neither approach, we argue, is sufficient to explore ongoing, messy transformations – i.e. the interactive processes of fossil fuel phase out and phase-in of alternative, low(er) carbon systems. We build on GE and GRE, incorporating insights from constructivist International Political Economy of energy and Socio-technical Transitions literatures, to set out four core aspects, temporal, material, geographic, and political economy, of energy systems under dynamic conditions of transformation. This re-framing of energy geopolitics is less about understanding the political consequences of energy geopolitics, as in GE and GRE realist-inspired accounts, and more about redefining energy whilst it is changing: creating an understanding of energy transformation as involving complex interactions between the four aspects. We then identify and explore interactions across two case studies: one within the ‘high carbon’ transition, the changing roles of gas, and one within the low carbon transition, the uptake of batteries and associated natural resource demands. The aspiration here is to build towards an integrated geopolitical economy of energy transformation framework and we see this paper as a key step: it shows empirically (via the cases) how these the aspects of energy system change interact and illustrates the value of aiming for a more integrated and dynamic approach.",University of Warwick,University of Warwick,,,,,,,University of Warwick,University of Warwick,Mathieu Blondeel,Caroline Kuzemko,,,,,,,Mathieu Blondeel,Caroline Kuzemko,International Relations,Political Economy,Constructivism,Climate Change,Energy,Theoretical,,,Energy System Transformation: Towards an Integrated Geopolitical Economy Framing,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63964&EventID=185
0,"The energy transition does not present just a technological challenge. The emerging technological innovations take place within a social context in which requirements are set for the energy system of the future: affordable, reliable, and sustainable. The complexity of the challenge lies in how the energy transition can develop along with the societal needs, creating the necessary support for the transition to happen and enabling cooperative frameworks between the government and the citizens.
The sufficient availability of well-qualified people is an important precondition for solving the current and future climate and energy issues and, therefore, the labor market will undergo a significant transformation due to the energy and climate imperatives. Those newly formed conditions will impact parts of society on a different scale and pace. 
This paper, focusing on the Dutch case, seeks to provide a comprehensive overview of the role of women within the energy transition from three perspectives, technical, economic, and social. Then, by identifying the status of women working within the Dutch energy transition, the paper will attempt a critical assessment of the set priorities/ambitions, policies, and strategies developed by the Dutch public and private sector within the intersection of gender, energy transition, and the climate change combat.

0,"Disabled people have acquired over time, in the form of international treaties like the United Nation Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CPRD), protections from the state and guarantees to ‘fundamental rights’ that ensures the application of principles that promises/provide them a dignified life. However, this understanding has shifted over time, and this is due to societal changes and the attempts to deregulate the welfare state and restrict access to its services. This shift can be seen in how nation’s view ‘citizenship’ and their evolving perceptions of ‘core values’ that should prevail in a community; which must be reflected in an individual if they are to ‘fit in’  or able to become a ‘functional citizen.’.” This especially holds true for ‘newcomers’ and how they are treated and perceived  by the nation when attempting to access or “earn” or “deserve” citizenship. However, this status can only be obtained by fulfilling specific criteria, which for some groups can be difficult to achieve. This can be the case for people with disabilities, in particular with the emphasis upon the  “economic self-sufficiency ”  or earning their rights based off their  “capacity”  to contribute to the state. As a result, states have the faculty  to negatively discriminate against foreign immigrants even if they fall within a ‘protected’ group or category that can or should be exempted (i.e. positive discrimination) from certain criteria. Thus, there exists an intersecting policy tension  between the “positive” discrimination in the forms of exemptions of citizenship criteria of disabled people and the “negative” discrimination of migrants. One of the best ‘case studies’ to examine such tensions is that of Switzerland, a country that is long established as a country of immigration with a differentiated legislation since WW I alongside a ‘human rights  tradition.’ Therefore, it provides a rich ‘case study’ to examine such policy tensions in the field of migration. This study will compile and examine  caselaw from the Swiss Federal Court that pertains to foreign migrants with disabilities and pose the following questions: (i) How has the legal framework that regulates access to Swiss citizenship through naturalization of immigrants with a disability evolved over time? (ii) Has said legal framework become more or less inclusive over time and (iii) On what grounds, and along what dimensions? In order to answer these questions, this study seeks to examine the evolution of the disability norm in  law and its implementation via case law, utilizing a ‘historical analysis of law’ and apply it to the relevant articles and cases.",Université de Neuchâtel,,,,,,,,Université de Neuchâtel,,Leslie Ader,,,,,,,,Leslie Ader,,Citizenship,Integration,Migration,Courts,Immigration,Qualitative,,,Entanglements of Citizenship and Disability Rights: Inclusive or Exclusive Integration Criteria,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63788&EventID=185
0,"An emerging literature looks at how trade unions approach immigration. A main finding in this literature is that unions have ambivalent positions. Importantly, however, this ambivalence is thought to be higher in regard to immigrant entry than immigrant rights (i.e. rights that are granted to those that have already entered). Traditionally, unions have been depicted as preferring low rates of immigration in order to avoid labor market competition for their members, yet there is also evidence that they have realized that restrictive entry policies are counterproductive since they cause precarious irregular immigration (Watts 2002). In regard to rights, the positions of unions should be less ambiguous. Indeed, it is in the interest of unions to promote immigrants’ rights so as to lower the migrant workers’ “competitive advantage” vis-à-vis local workers. In this paper, we use data on immigration policy for 18 OECD countries for the years 1980-2010. Using various different policy indices, these data allow us to differentiate between a number of dimensions of immigration policy, notably the area of immigrant entry and the area of immigrant rights. We can thus explicitly test whether strong unions affect entry policies differently than rights policies. We find that indeed, union strength is associated with more restrictive entry policies for labor migrants, but that on the other hand, strong unions are associated with more rights for these migrants, although this is not robust to different model specifications. Our findings thus lend further support to the hypothesis that unions have nuanced positions towards immigration, but also suggest that they affect policy making relating to entry more than policy making relating to rights.",Max Planck Institute for the Study of Religious and Ethnic Diversity,Universität Bremen,Universität Bremen,,,,,,Universität Bremen,,Eloisa Harris,Jakob Henninger,Friederike Römer,,,,,,Friederike Römer,,Citizenship,Civil Society,Comparative Politics,Migration,Immigration,Asylum,Policy Change,,"Entry and Equality?

0,"Environmental governance is a quickly growing interdisciplinary area of research that combines contributions from more established disciplines such as political science, international relations, public administration and planning, geography, economics, and sociology. Perhaps more than traditional environmental politics or policy research, governance research aspires to be policy-relevant. In order to provide an evidence base that is taken seriously by policy-makers, governance research needs to produce relevant, reliable and trusted knowledge on pressing issues of what governance arrangements work best to effectively address urgent environment issues. Arguably, such knowledge needs to be of a cumulative nature, where new research refines, challenges, complements or synthesizes existing research.

There is, however, a growing recognition that environmental governance research is facing serious challenges to produce trusted, cumulative knowledge about what governance arrangements “work” under what conditions. The research area’s topics, approaches, concepts, geographies, research questions and methods are so diverse that research often occurs in parallel universes. Concepts are seldom used consistently across studies. The field is dominated by single case studies wanting synthesis and integration. Shared analytical frameworks are rare. And while the works of others are of course cited, existing research is rarely truly challenged or built upon in such a way that genuine scientific progress would emerge. 

In order to gain a deeper understanding of how and where environmental governance research does cumulate (and where it does not), we study the sub-community of ‘Earth System Governance’ (ESG) research as a prototypical example. To this end, we identified 362 published papers from seven ESG conferences, of which we analyse a random set of 100 publications. We show descriptive statistics and network graphs to characterise this body of research.  The resulting set of 100 journal papers were coded for their theoretical, conceptual, normative-prescriptive or empirical orientation. Empirical papers are coded for a qualitative, quantitative, interpretive or meta-analytical research approach, and whether they can generally be regarded as positivist or constructivist. We coded in what way papers add to, refine, challenge or synthesise existing research, and in what way they contribute to developing shared frameworks, definitions or datasets.

Overall, we find that knowledge cumulation is still poorly developed within the ESG community. Like the field of environmental policy and governance more generally, ESG research may be characterised as a “fragmented adhocracy” (Whitley), explaining the widespread failure to produce robust and cumulative knowledge).",Leuphana Universität Lüneburg,Leuphana Universität Lüneburg,,,,,,,Leuphana Universität Lüneburg,,Jens Newig,Michael Rose,,,,,,,Michael Rose,,Environmental Policy,Governance,Knowledge,,,,,,"Environmental governance research: Interdisciplinary, Policy-oriented – and Cumulative?",https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65827&EventID=185

This paper will assess how the concept of political avant-garde agency may help to conceptualize this role as well as its related tensions. Adapting Lea Ypi’s (2012) concept of an avant-garde political agency, I will demonstrate how environmental movements challenge existing boundaries in formal politics and democratic discourse. Additionally, I will elaborate how the concept of an avant-garde may also show limits to the democratic self-understanding of environmental movements. Building on avant-garde theory in the arts, as well as political thinkers such as Gramsci, Sorel and Lenin, I will discuss inherent tensions to the concept and how these prove relevant in the context of movements, their tactics and their relationship to democracy. Based on this analysis, I will discuss how the concept of avant-garde political agency may prompt us to rethink to what extent movements can overcome implicit or open forms of oppression and to what extent they can speak for an intended constituency without losing their legitimate claim to representation.

0,"This paper studies whether more authoritarian regional governments in Russia are better able to solve the growing problem of waste management. We focus on the case of waste management because there is a significant variation across the regions in terms of waste management efforts. This is puzzling considering the importance of waste management for all regional governments and the urgency of the problem for the Russian population as reflected in public opinion polls. Using a regional panel data set for the period of 2012-2019, we examine whether the degree of competiveness of the regional political regimes can explain the differences in the implementation of waste management policies. We find that our proxy for political regime type - the share of votes for the United Russia party in the parliamentary elections - has a strong positive effect on the share of recycled waste in the Russian regions. These findings support the idea of environmental authoritarianism that suggests that authoritarian governments are better able to quickly mobilize different actors and provide an effective response to environmental challenges.

0,"One of the biggest challenges for contemporary liberal democracy is how much political weight should be given to extended beliefs about facts that are in tension with established expert opinion. This tension is the source of epistemic populism, which locates the plebeian rebellion against the elites not in the moral but in the epistemic dimension. While epistemic populism calls for a radical democratization of knowledge, and praises commonsense, folk wisdom and personal experience, it shows skepticism towards rarified methods, confirmation bias controls, and mediated procedures of justified knowledge-claims. The dilemma for liberal political theory is that whereas it cannot succumb to epistemic populism, as it has traditionally endorsed the scientific project, it cannot similarly succumb to technocracy or scientism, as valid democratic reasons are beliefs generally held and indeed found in common sense. The article suggests that this is the more pressing populist challenge to liberal democracy, as current and looming crises such as the pandemic and climate change require governments to take a stand: either the give political voice to scientific skeptics or they justify state action on generally non-accessible epistemologies. This could be the scenario that resolves the old theoretical struggle between a liberalism of tolerance and diversity, on the one hand, and a liberalism of rational autonomy, on the other; while the former will accommodate forms of epistemic populism within its institutional ethos, the latter will insist in the polity’s capacity to acknowledge a universally valid knowledge-generator.",Universidad Adolfo Ibáñez,,,,,,,,Universidad Adolfo Ibáñez,,Cristóbal Bellolio,,,,,,,,Cristóbal Bellolio,,Democracy,Green Politics,Political Theory,Populism,Knowledge,Analytic,Liberalism,Normative Theory,Epistemic populism and liberal democracy,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64325&EventID=185
0,"The literature on cabinet proportionality—i.e. the fairness of cabinet payoffs to legislative parties participating in coalition governments—has historically been focused on parliamentary systems. In pure parliamentarism, scholars have generally have found strong support for “Gamson’s Law” qualified by occasional overrepresentation of small parties. As the literature broadened to include semipresidentialism, scholars found a larger “formateur bonus” for coalition-proposing parties holding the presidency, conditional on the degree of constitutional powers afforded to the president. In pure presidential systems, the emerging literature on coalitional presidentialism has found a consistently large and disproportionate payoff for the party of the unipersonal executive, who is always the formateur in such systems. However, these three literatures on cabinet payoffs have largely operated in isolation, making it difficult to estimate, in comparative terms, the size of the formateur bonus across constitutional formats.

In this paper, we provide the first large-N, cross-national estimation of the size of the formateur bonus across multiple executive formats. We do so by expanding the new WhoGov dataset (Nyrup and Bramwell, APSR 2020) to include legislative seats shares of all cabinet-represented parties, thus allowing us to measure cabinet coalescence and the size of the formateur bonus in over 3500 country-years of competitive politics in 117 countries in the period from 1966 to 2018. To this we add party-system covariates such as the predominant form of party linkages (V-Dem and V-Party). Our hypothesis is that the formateur bonus should be the largest where executive discretion is high and party programmaticity is low, that is, in unipersonal executives embedded in predominantly clientelistic party systems.",University of Oxford,University of Oxford,,,,,,,University of Oxford,,Paul Chaisty,Timothy Power,,,,,,,Timothy Power,,Comparative Politics,Executives,Parliaments,Political Parties,,,,,Estimating the Formateur Bonus across Executive Formats and Party Systems,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=62225&EventID=185
0,"The EU is facing increasing contestation, geared towards (partial) disintegration. Political actors – from civil society movements to political parties to governments – call upon member states to reverse elements of European integration (see, e.g., the new “French sovereignism”). These empirical developments are flanked by a growing academic literature that recommends member states take the “way out downwards” (Streeck), i.e., exit, in response to perceived legitimacy deficits of EU governance. Yet, any step of EU disintegration also carries the danger of a loss of normative achievements – in particular, a weakening of supranational democracy. This raises the question of when reversals of European integration can be considered legitimate and under what conditions they amount to (democratic) regression.

Decarbonisation will result in a decrease in the demand for fossil fuel energy. As fossil fuel exporters in the Southern Mediterranean are reliant on the EU being by far their main importer this could result in a loss of rents to give privileges to vested elites. If rents would fall this can result in a loss of government support with possible consequences still recently witnessed with the uprisings in countries such as Algeria. Reactions of the fossil fuel suppliers can be manifold however if the EU doesn’t act adequately it can lose its influence in the region as others are ready to fill in the gap.

A sociological perspective provides us with a more realistic and critical picture of Europeanization and democratic politics as a non-violent socially organized form of conflict and cooperation. Expanding upon this train of thought, in this contribution ‘Europeanization’ refers to the institutionalization and differentiation of groups and discourses through political struggles and negotiations that aim to define and reproduce legitimate principles (idea(l)s and practices) of social domination. This has led to the emergence of a European political field, as it is outlined in this contribution, constituting a dynamic topography (Kauppi 2005), an evolving and uneven multileveled space of action. With time, social differentiation and the development of the division of political labor have made the three subfields of the multi-level political field of the European Union, namely the local/regional, the national, and the European, more distinct.

Second, we investigate the frames and metaphors used to describe EU institutions, actors and policies in order to test to what extent Italian and Spanish news articles remain fundamentally different regardless the outlet political leaning (or whether narratives about European integration converge over time). Preliminary results suggest that, while EU politics continues to be viewed from a national perspective, media coverage of the Eurozone crisis and Covid-19 pandemic has contributed to the development of a shared Southern European narrative of the integration processes, and in turn the emergence of a (Southern) European public sphere.

0,"A great deal of European sociology is interested in Europeans’ attitudes towards Europe and the EU. Research on Euroskepticism, European (financial) solidarity, transnationalism, and the effect of European inequalities has produced a large body of literature. In this paper, based on qualitative interviews with people living in Germany, Poland, and Italy, we change perspective and focus on a particular finding from our material: our interview partners, while generally thinking positive about Europe and even identifying as Europeans, have quite little to say about Europe. In their day-to-day lives, even though they travel and have contacts abroad, other European nationalities and countries are simply irrelevant. This makes investigating issues like transnational social trust and other attitudes towards fellow Europeans difficult. But it also tells us something about such attitudes which, we argue, become only salient when practically relevant. And, indeed, Europe is not practically relevant for citizens’ daily lives as our interviewpartners readily admitted. We explain our findings from a pragmatist theoretical perspective. Moreover, our findings connect with research conducted by, e.g., Van Ingelgom (2014) on the indifference of citizens towards Europe.

0,"Identity matters for explaining attitudes towards the EU and also in the case of migration. But how? Most of the existing literature builds on a binary conceptualization of identity, which essentially distinguishes between EU citizens that have integrated some (not specified) form of a European identity – in contrast to those who have exclusively national identities. Not surprisingly, empirical studies show that exclusive national identities correlate with preferences for more restrictive migration policies. A shortcoming of this set-up is that the analytical link between identity and migration policy preference is rather loose, as the correlation between the two may only reflect that they correspond to a common latent dimension, and it ignores the multidimensionality of both identity and migration policy. We propose a more nuanced framework of identity which (a) distinguishes between a civic and cultural conception and (b) varies in how citizens evaluate their own in-group vis-à-vis the out-group. In a second step, we aim to relate this conceptualization of identity to EU migration attitudes, where we distinguish between two forms of community membership and predict whom one prefers as a (a) member of the EU/European community or neighbor, and (b) migrant coming to the EU. We present the first results from our survey, including a conjoint experiment, evaluating the links between respondents' EU/European identity and their preferences regarding different types of migrants.

0,"According to the European Agenda on Migration promulgated in 2015, the two main goals of the policies developed to face the South European migration crisis were protecting the European borders and the fight against irregular migration. As a result, the
borders have been successfully defended during the following years, showing a consistent decrease of irregular migrants arriving on the European coasts. We depart from the following research question: What are the EU's perceptions about borders' and migrants' security, and how do they reflect in EU's public policies for migration. This paper aims to analyze the dichotomy between the borders' security and the migrants' security, identifying how the first can affect the latter with negative externalities and how EU policies embody the disjunction of these two ways of perceiving migration security. The migrations' sustainability is often at risk because of governance dominated by the necessity of ""closing the harbours"", oriented towards the externalization of the migrants flows management and less developed around the human
rights protection. We base our study on two different parts. The first is a deep dive into European legislation.

Since ‘Maastricht’, Euroscepticism – often equated with opposition towards the EU – is widely believed to have become part and parcel of politics across the EU. In this context, events such as the Brexit referendum and European Parliament elections provide an opportunity for Eurosceptic movements across Europe to politicise European integration, with media playing an essential role by providing society with the possibility to debate, influence and criticise political deliberations and policymaking. Yet, despite the growing body of literature on Euroscepticism and a similar increase in research on media coverage of EU affairs, there has been comparatively less dedicated research that brings together these two strands of research.

I engage with this topic through a qualitative content analysis of politicisation through Euroscepticism in major Dutch newspapers. The focus will be on varieties of Euroscepticism and opposition to the EU as present in mediated debates in the context of the 2009, 2014 and 2019 European Parliament elections. The Netherlands is a good example of a country where European integration has become subject to an increasingly critical debate. During the 1991 intergovernmental conference the Dutch government proposed a far-reaching blueprint for a federal Europe. Yet, 14 years later, on 1 June 2005, Dutch citizens overwhelmingly voted against the Constitutional Treaty, partly due to increased dissatisfaction with the pace and extent of European integration.

During the period from 2009 to 2019 there has been an increase of Eurosceptic Members of European Parliament. In addition, the EU was confronted with several crises, in particular the Eurozone crisis, the migration crisis and Brexit. Focussing on the elections during this period, I will present new data from an ongoing project that distinguishes between rejectionist positions and critical positions that can be seen as part and parcel of normal politics is essential. I introduce a four-fold typology: support for the current state of European integration; criticism towards (elements of) EU policies or its institutional design often accompanied by alternative proposals, but essentially is supportive of the EU and European integration (‘Euroalternativism’); soft Euroscepticism, rejecting the current state of European integration for being too supranational; and hard Euroscepticism, entailing a rejection of European integration.",Maastricht Universiteit,,,,,,,,Maastricht Universiteit,,Patrick Bijsmans,,,,,,,,Patrick Bijsmans,,Media,Qualitative,Euroscepticism,European Parliament,,,,,European Parliament Elections and the mainstreaming of Euroscepticism in the Dutch Press,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=62591&EventID=185
0,"The developing participation of the European Parliament within CFSP has led the institution to engage in democracy support activities vis-à-vis third countries such as Colombia. The latter gained the attention within the Parliament and its mechanisms such as the thematic hearings, parliamentary missions and interparliamentary discussions within EuroLat. Looking through the sociological institutionalist lens, this paper aims to analyze the outcomes of the European Parliament’s international actions as regards democracy support in Colombia. Such theoretical framework will be complemented by the reflection provided by Levitsky and Way on the Linkage and Leverage of democracy promotion policies. On the basis of official documents, including minutes and resolutions, of the European Parliament ranging from 2009 to 2021, the paper’s analysis will attempt to validate the Levitsky and Way’s work to the extent that it will add evidence that the high level of linkages between the EU and Colombia has lead to a high leverage of the European Parliament policies towards this country.","MINHO, University of",Research Center in Political Science (CICP) – UMinho/UÉvora,,,,,,,Research Center in Political Science (CICP) – UMinho/UÉvora,,Laura C.

0,"This paper analyses the trajectory of European Union (EU) governance of primary and secondary schools and teacher policy over the period 2010-2021 in terms of the mix of instruments, sequencing and critical junctures, and how the specific features of EU governance impact policy design and selection of instruments. In this way, the paper addresses the research lacunae concerning multilevel governance dimensions and the mixing of policy instruments over time (Capano and Howlett 2020). 

The paper contextualises EU schools and teacher policy as part of the ‘Knowledge Economy and Lifelong Learning’ political and administrative space which has emerged in Europe since the 1990s and involves novel ways in thinking and enacting policy instrumentation and intersectoral coordination (Dale 2009). Accordingly, the paper adopts the theoretical lens of policy instrumentation (Capano and Howlett 2020; Milana et al. 2020) in order to make sense of the evolving relations between ‘toolkits’ of instruments which have in common that they have implications for EU schools and teacher policy. In this respect, the paper specifically analyses the evolving mix of policy instruments associated with the Strategic Framework for European Cooperation in Education and Training (ET2020), the European Semester, the European Pillar of Social Rights, and the Structural Reform Support Service.

The research design underpinning the paper involves diachronic analysis based on an empirical material consisting of 30 key policy documents, issued by the European Commission between 2010 and 2021, and 20 semi-structured research interviews with individuals with firsthand experience of the administration of relevant policy instruments. QDA Miner and WordStat were used for complementary content analysis (Neuendorf 2017) and critical discourse analysis (Fairclough 2013), centred on the framing of issues, ideas and policy instruments, interests and institutions that in combination influence policy design.

The paper demonstrates the incremental ‘lock-in’ (Dahler-Larsen 2014) in the design of EU schools and teacher policy since 2010, defined by three interrelated trends: i) schools and teacher policy as forming part of boundary-spanning policy regimes (Jochim and May 2010); ii) the continuous and reflexive circulation of data and knowledge as a common foundation in policy instrumentation; and iii) strengthened coupling of European funding and investment programmes with other policy instruments.

0,"In recent decades, the landscape of higher education has undergone constant structural reforms in which higher education institutions have entered into all kinds of collaborations, either voluntarily or as a result of government policy. These partnerships vary from the individual to the institutional level, involve different partners (private and public), relate to different activities (education, research or social services) and take different forms (from one-off collaborations to mergers). Moreover, we find these partnerships at different levels: local, regional, national and cross-border cooperation. The motives and intentions for entering into such strategic arrangements vary widely. In my contribution, the emphasis is on transnational alliances. Although the idea of university alliances on a European scale is not new (Gunn 2020)  , it has received a significant boost since 2017 with a speech by French President Macron. His plea for developing European universities was picked up by the European Commission, which subsequently developed concrete plans to create a network of European universities. In 2019 and 2020, the EC published a call where universities are asked to come up with plans to develop transnational partnerships (European universities). For the three-year pilot phase, grants are made available through the Erasmus+ and Horizon 2020 programmes. In the meantime, 41 alliances have been launched. In March 2022, the first 17 universities (from the 2019 call) applied for the second round , where the actual roll-out of the alliance should take place. Should this European initiative succeed, it will have at least two structural consequences: it will create universities at the supranational level - a new layer in higher education - and it will affect the interrelationships between institutions at the national level. The latter is a serious concern for national governments. Is it desirable? How should it be shaped? In my contribution, I address this last question by looking at the way in which universities participating in a European university are being funded. In principle, European universities can be funded in four ways: with contributions from the EC, national government, own resources and other public or private contributions. I will focus on the contribution of national governments. We know that these national contributions in the initial pilot phase vary widely, both in volume and in form.

0,"Today, the European Union (EU) is the world's most financially powerful player when it comes to international cooperation with the Global South. There are different international frameworks of African-European relations: the Joint Africa-EU Strategy (JAES), the European Neighborhood Policy (ENP) for North African countries, the Cotonou Agreement with the African, Caribbean and Pacific Group of States (ACP) and its successor agreements (see below). In addition, there are international organizations that provide a broader framework and influence African-European relations: The United Nations with its Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), in times of the Covid pandemic, also the policies of the World Health Organization as part of the UN. Moreover, the World Trade Organization plays a role with its requirements for trade (since 2007, exceptions only for ""least developed countries"" which can continue to import duty free, ""everything but arms""), and also the World Bank.

Relations between the EU and the African Union (AU) and its respective member states will be reset in 2022. The Heads of State and Government of the EU and the African Union (AU) and their respective Member States met in Brussels on February 17-18, 2022 for the sixth EU-AU Summit. The renewed Africa-EU Strategy is a unique opportunity to lay the foundations for a more pragmatic AU-EU partnership. The strategy includes also the ""Post-Cotonou"" Agreements, i.e. a framework agreement for all former ACP countries (States of Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP), today: States of the Organisation of African, Caribbean and Pacific States (OACPS)), plus a specific agreement for Africa and more specialized Economic Partnership Agreements with the various states and regions. The ""Post Cotonou"" framework Agreement has been discussed for years, it is on the table now, and its entry into force is expected in summer 2022.
 
The proposed paper deals with the relationship between the EU and the AU and analyses in a first step its various supranational and international angles. In a second step, it examines the following factors influencing EU-AU relations:
(a) the Agenda 2030 and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the United Nations, especially the economic SDGs 8, 9 and 12 as well as the partnership focused SDG 17, (b) the regime of the World Trade Organization which lead to the establishment of several Economic Partnership Agreements (EPS), (c) intra-African developments such as the establishment of the African Continental Free Trade Area in 2018, and (e) intra-European developments such as the exit of the UK as a former colonial power. 
The pandemic took influence on all these variables. Therefore, the paper will finally discuss the influence of Covid-19 on the EU-AU relations and discuss the AU-EU partnership in a broader geopolitical context.","Innsbruck University, CIFE, Kehl University, Danube University",University of Kent,,,,,,,University of Kent,,Doris Dialer,Annegret Eppler,,,,,,,Annegret Eppler,,Africa,European Union,Globalisation,International Relations,UN,WTO,Trade,,"European-African Relations ""Post Cotonou"" and ""Post Covid-19""",https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64276&EventID=185
0,"This paper explores Eu’s engagement toward China in a context of a shifting global economic order. It seeks to explain the resilience of Eu-China strategic partnership despite growing salience of a systemic rivalry between both actors. The framing of China as a systemic rival to EU tends to be considered as a shift of paradigms in EU policy. Such a standpoint offer poor explanatory force for the remaining dialogue dynamics and its late outcomes such as Comprehensive Agreement on Investment and coordination in battling Covid-19. This paper aims to reach an explanation by considering Eu-China socialization process. It relies on desk research and a diachronic discourse analysis of the socialization process; data collection encompasses EU policy paper and EU-China Annual Summit (EC-AS) joint statements. Findings of the analysis permit to consider systemic rivalry and strategic partnership as similar outputs of the same socialization framework. Furthermore, this research delivers a new analytical framework to comprehend systemic rivalry and its impact in a post-pandemic context. This paper opens the floor for a research agenda focusing on normative power, instead of great power relations, to understand EU's foreign policy.

The ACA was born out of a public petition (Volksbegehren) supported by around 380,000 citizens in 2020 and was taken over by the country’s first conservative and green coalition government in 2021. One of the public petition’s core demands was to give the Austrian population an active say in climate policy. This paper assesses ACA’s design and analyses problems of deliberative settings, focusing on the input, process and output dimensions. We have four overarching objectives: First, understanding drivers, design, and outcomes of the ACA. Second, exploring the ways in which the ACA interacts with and connects to representative democracy. Third, identifying lessons learned for organizers and facilitators of future mini-publics.

0,"Some policy conflicts flare up and down, becoming resolved relatively quickly. Other policy conflicts endure, sometimes for years, decades, or longer. During these enduring policy conflicts, policy actors (i.e., a term used to describe those politically engaged) regularly evaluate the status of the varied dimensions of the policy conflict, judging whether these dimensions are getting worse, better, or staying the same. Yet, while our knowledge about policy conflict, either directly or indirectly studied, continues to ramify theoretically and empirically, unknowns remain about how these policy actors evaluate their circumstances.
This paper answers two questions: What patterns occur in policy actor evaluations of issues surrounding a policy conflict in two time periods? What factors explain these patterns? We answer these questions using two policy actor surveys administered in 2015 and 2017 of oil and gas development in Colorado, USA. Using these two surveys, we analyze and compare responses to questions of policy actors in panel and non-panel samples. The questions target ten pertinent issues related to the policy conflict and ask policy actors to assess whether these issues are getting worse, better, or staying the same. The findings are threefold. First, we find more stability than instability in their evaluations and variation across different evaluation measures. Second, we find their normative positions in favor or opposition to oil and gas development associate significantly with their evaluation perceptions. Third, what change occurs in the evaluation perceptions link to shifting perceptions of threats, problems, and benefits and risks associated with oil and gas development.
This paper confirms ongoing theoretical arguments about the stickiness of positions on issues related to policy conflict and the normative lenses imposed on evaluating policy-related success and failures. In other words, people make sense of a policy conflict to reinforce their normative orientation, amplified by perceptions of threats. We conclude with a broader challenge in developing knowledge about how policy actors participate and perceive their policy conflicts.",University of Colorado Denver,,,,,,,,University of Colorado Denver,,Chris Weible,,,,,,,,Chris Weible,,Conflict,Policy Analysis,Public Policy,Policy Change,Energy Policy,Policy-Making,,,"Evaluative perceptions of policy conflicts: Are issues getting better, worse, or staying the same?",https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64877&EventID=185
0,"The paper explores a policy conflict over sand and gravel mining in a rural area in the Czech Republic. For more than 12 years, numerous efforts have been made to start gravel mining close to Moravský Písek – an area with a long agricultural tradition and the fifth large drinking reservoir in the Czech Republic. This plan agreed by the Ministry of the Environment raised a wave of protests among nearby municipalities. According to them, the whole process has been accompanied by a number of dubious steps by public authorities and regulatory bodies. 
This case might represent a typical example of a clash between lower tiers of governments and their civil society supporters with higher tiers of governments. However, this vertical conflict is accompanied by numerous horizontal conflicts – between public authorities, experts or public interests. Last but not least, the conflict has an important temporal dimension. The paper uses the Bakhtin’s concept of chronotope as referring to the unity of time and space inherent to a narrative in order to highlight an interconnectedness of geographical and temporal dimensions in analysed policy narratives. 
The paper explores the role of future imaginaries in policy conflicts. It employs Jens Beckert’s two modes of relating to the future – (1) calculation and (2) utopia – and examines their role in policy narratives. From this perspective, policy conflict can also be reframed as a conflict among different kind of risks calculations, imaginations and emotions. What future imaginaries are articulated in the public debate, how those imaginaries are justified and what responses they produce. 
Doing so the paper departs from a discourse analysis of policy documents and public hearings. The paper examines how local actors manipulate with the scope of conflict in discursive, spatial and temporal dimensions and how local conflicts are related to macro-debates and global risks – such as climate change or crisis of democracy in this particular case. The paper intends to bridge macro-micro distinctions in studies of policy conflicts and to describe how broader policy conflicts might be incorporated in local arenas, what are consequences of those discursive strategies and what is the role of time and space in studies of policy conflicts.",Charles University,Charles University,,,,,,,Charles University,,Karel Cada,Eva Hejzlarova,,,,,,,Eva Hejzlarova,,Environmental Policy,Public Policy,Social Movements,Qualitative,Narratives,Activism,,,Every Grain of Sand: A Chronotope of a Policy Conflict,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=66108&EventID=185
0,"While initial research has often substitutes populist attitudes with political trust, recent advances suggest that political trust and populism are two distinct concepts (Geurkink, Zaslove, Sluiter, and Jacobs 2020). Based on these discussions I seek to understand which actors do populists individuals trust and distrust. More specifically, I distinguish partial and impartial forms of political trust (Zmerli 2017). The former captures trust in political actors such as parliament, government or political parties. In contrast, impartial trust refers to political trust in actors, which are supposed to be impartial, such as administrative bodies, the police. In principle, expert committees would similarly fall into this group. While the literature generally identifies a gap between those two forms of trust and suggests that citizens trust impartial actors more (Kulin and Johansson Sevä 2021), I argue that this gap should be substantially smaller for populist individuals. That is because the trust advantage of independent actors lies in their impartiality. However, populists do not perceive them to be impartial but rather party of the conspiring elite. I test these expectations with survey data.

Little is known about how researchers should time the introduction of uncertain evidence for policy makers. With a computational model, we simulate how policy makers update their opinions in light of new evidence. We illustrate the use of our model with two examples in which timing and certainty matter for policy making: intelligence analysts scouting potential terrorist activity and food safety inspections of chicken meat. Our computations indicate that evidence should always come early to convince policy makers, no matter how certain it is. Even if the evidence is quite certain, it will not convince all policy makers.

However, we still know surprisingly little about the existence of a bottom-up pathway to subnational democratization. In this paper, I theorize two such pathways: the evolutionary and the revolutionary one. In the evolutionary pathway, social movement actors start with making covert claims. They activate a self-productive sequence that directly facilitates subnational democratization. In the revolutionary pathway, social movement actors start by making overt claims. They activate a self-destructive sequence that indirectly facilitates subnational democratization.

0,"The normative literature on differentiated integration (DI) has specified conditions under which DI can be regarded a fair scheme of cooperation. The paper first develops a framework for the assessment of fair international cooperation, building on republican-statist and liberal-cosmopolitan perspectives. Subsequently, the framework is applied to three forms of DI which seemingly contradict fair cooperation: involuntary exclusions from EU policies, non-compliance with treaty obligations to join the common currency, and continued policy alignment despite formal opt-outs. For each form, the paper offers a conceptual clarification and provides an empirical overview before discussing its normative implications. 

The empirical mapping shows that the three forms of DI are not as exceptional as may have been expected. Each form affects multiple EU member states, often for extended periods of time. Normatively, each of the three forms poses significant challenges to fair cooperation in the EU. Involuntary exclusions are procedurally problematic if accession is vetoed by other member states for reasons different from the initially stipulated technical criteria for inclusion. Non-compliance with treaty obligations represents a challenge to the rule of law in the EU, which neither democratic nor functional arguments can justify. Post-differentiation alignment is especially problematic where legal non-participation is rooted in a democratically expressed popular preference.",European University Institute,,,,,,,,European University Institute,,Stefan Telle,,,,,,,,Stefan Telle,,European Union,Differentiation,Normative Theory,,,,,,"Exception to a fair scheme of cooperation?

A stream of literature using econometric methods has analysed the connection between economic factors, cultural factors and the share of the populist vote, however the results have been mixed. While Inglehart and Norris (2016) and Mutz (2018) found that cultural factors influence voters far more when voting for populist parties, Guiso et al., (2018) found the opposite: economic decline will influence voters to vote for populist parties. 
This paper identifies two major shocks for investigation: the unemployment shock of the Financial Crisis of 2008/2009 and the globalization shock of China joining the WTO in 2001. The shock of the financial crisis led to a huge rise in unemployment for which the traditional parties had no answers, leading for voters to seek out alternative parties, promising them quick and easy solutions. The globalization shock of China joining the WTO, led to manufacturing regions experiencing additional competition for the goods they produced resulting in layoffs and loss of business. This increased support for populist parties. 
This article uses a 2SLS estimation method and IV variables to test the relationship between exogenous shocks and voting for populist parties. The article finds that both unemployment and both the globalization shock are significant factors in explaining the populist vote, therefore if governments want to act against it, they have to provide fiscal support to people suffering from the exogenous effects of financial crises and globalization.",Centre for Social Sciences,Corvinus University of Budapest,,,,,,,Corvinus University of Budapest,,Tamás Barczikay,András Tétényi,,,,,,,András Tétényi,,Europe (Central and Eastern),Democracy,Populism,,,,,,Exogenous shocks and voter behaviour in Central and Eastern Europe,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64522&EventID=185

0,"The emergence of “wicked problems” necessitates the inclusion of diverse sources of expertise at all stages of the policy process. Policy makers are increasingly expected to use the best available evidence (Head 2015) leading to a growing “professionalisation” of policy making  (Christensen 2018). In this context, the role of knowledge in policy making  has attracted particular scholarly interest.

This research agenda has, however, largely been focused on Western countries. Its insights, although informative, cannot necessarily be generalised to other contexts as styles of expertise provision and even understanding about what constitutes acceptable evidence vary substantially across countries (Straßheim and Kettunen 2014).  

Furthermore, although the dynamics of knowledge provision have been studied extensively, the fundamental question about the relative influence of experts in an increasingly contested deliberative process has received less attention. Reorientating the research agenda would facilitate the incorporation of knowledge utilisation scholarship into broader debates about policy advice and allow for a more holistic understanding of the policy impact of knowledge and expertise (Christensen 2020).

This paper aims to address both those gaps by examining the role of experts in the drafting of Bulgaria's National Energy and Climate Plan 2021-2030. Through a single-case study research design, the paper addresses the following research questions:
- What type of expertise was used in the formulation of the Plan and how/ by whom was it provided?
- What influence did experts have on policy formulation when compared to other advisory actors?
- What factors accounted for the (lack) of influence of expert advice?

We adopt an instrumental conceptualisation of influence (Amara et al. 2004) which focuses on experts’ impact on the content of the final policy product - namely the Plan adopted in 2020. This will be measured through a combination of process tracing and attributed influence approach, which are the most common and reliable ways to study influence (Christensen 2020). The paper will utilise document analysis and semi-structured interviews with stakeholders involved in policy formulation. 

The proposed study will represent a contribution to the section since it examines knowledge utilisation in a previously un(der)studied political setting, namely flawed democratic regimes. Moreover, the choice of case study presents an opportunity to study the role and influence of domestic experts as well as the international and European community. Although the increased interdependence between domestic and international knowledge communities has been recognised (Stone 2008), the phenomenon has scarcely been studied empirically. Furthermore, given the nature of the Plan, which dealt with highly politically sensitive topics related to energy security, potential coal phase out and aspects of the energy industry in Bulgaria where significant state capture and corruption risks exist, the case would provide an illustration of the ways in which knowledge use is impacted by politics and vested interests in highly sensitive policy subsystems. Finally, the explicit focus on the influence of experts and its determinants represents a contribution to the literature on knowledge utilisation as well as policy advice more generally where those topics have rarely been examined empirically.",University of Leuven,KU Leuven,,,,,,,University of Leuven,,Denitsa Marchevska,Trui Steen,,,,,,,Denitsa Marchevska,,Governance,Public Policy,Knowledge,Influence,Policy-Making,,,,Expert influence in highly politicised settings?

0,"Government agencies that depend on reputations for scientific expertise (i.e., expert agencies) might communicate uncertainty to citizens, and this may impact citizens’ engagement in democratic deliberations about public policies. Such engagement may in turn be important for democratic legitimacy and quality of decisions. A strong public reputation for scientific expertise, that is, a widely-held public belief that the agency is scientifically expert in its policy area, could encourage or discourage deliberation (a weak reputation would have the reverse effect). Which effect a reputation has on deliberation may depend on the relative power of two alternative styles of communication that agencies adopt.

One style is to present advice as knowledge. Public science communication emphasizing uncertainty often results in negative effects, so communicators should be cautious, especially about expressing consensus uncertainty. Hence, agencies take a risk when communicating uncertainty. Admitting uncertainties with communication styles that invite to dialogue, instead of primarily signaling the agency’s unique capacities and niche monopolies, may back-fire on the agency’s trust, with negative effect on its reputation for competence.

A second and alternative style is transparency about the state of knowledge. There are several reasons to be transparent about uncertainty and be open to discussions with audiences. Uncertainty is commonly the actual knowledge situation which makes authorities communicating certainty in a simplified way more exposed to the risk of being proven wrong. Properly framed, inviting an audience to dialogue with a willingness to defend and explain the knowledge communicated may also signal self-confidence and professionalism instead of hesitancy. 

Given agency reputations for scientific expertise, what effect may such alternative communication styles have on public deliberation? 

Presenting advice as knowledge could steer citizens toward deliberating when reputations are weak, and away from deliberating when reputations are strong. An agency with a strong reputation for scientific knowledge is likely to be believed if it claims to know something. In turn, citizens receiving advice from this agency are unlikely to want to deliberate further about what to do because they believe that simply following the agency’s advice is the best available course of action. Conversely, an agency with a weak reputation for scientific knowledge is unlikely to be believed if it claims to know something. In turn, citizens receiving advice from that agency will be sceptical, and either ignore what it asks for or engage in deliberations about the best course of action.

Presenting advice as an iteration based on current understanding could steer citizens away from deliberating when reputations are weak, and toward deliberating when reputations are strong. An agency with a strong scientific reputation can encourage citizens to reason about and discuss public policy because the agency’s inputs into thinking and reasoning are respected and believed. Conversely, an agency with a weak reputation is less able to encourage deliberation because citizens will tend not to respect its inputs or make use of them.",University of Melbourne,Uppsala Universitet,,,,,,,University of Melbourne,,Erik Baekkeskov,PerOla Öberg,,,,,,,Erik Baekkeskov,,Democracy,Political Participation,Public Administration,Public Policy,,,,,"Expert Reputation, Communication Style, and Democratic Deliberation (for panel on Politics of Bureaucratic Reputation).",https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64086&EventID=185
0,"Government agencies must operate in environments marked by competing demands originating from the multiplicity of audiences observing and judging their bureaucratic conduct. Due to the wide diversity and multidimensional nature of external demands, agencies must prioritize to which demands they respond first. A failure to timely and adequately address simulations and competing, external demands may result in colossal reputational loses. As a result, as bureaucratic reputation scholars argue, agencies are vigilant in deciding if, when, and how external demands are attended to. Resent scholarship has advanced our understanding of how bureaucrats prioritize between the multiplicity of simultaneous demands that vary on multiple aspects. However, while we know more about the causal effects of the source, content, and salience of external demands on bureaucrats’ prioritization decisions, we lack a better understanding of real-time prioritization judgements and decision-making processes. This study builds on the extant bureaucratic responsiveness scholarship to further theorize and empirically examine why bureaucrats choose to prioritize one external demands over the other and how reputational considerations feed in their prioritization judgements and decision-making processes. Empirically, we rely on a vignette interview study with bureaucrats working at EU-level agencies, public organizations particularly exposed to multiple external demands. Our vignette study enables us to assess participants’ choices by capturing actual decision-making processes by asking participants to choose and justify their choice to prioritize a particular external demand.","Departments of Political Science and Public Administration, Universiteit Leiden",,,,,,,,"Departments of Political Science and Public Administration, Universiteit Leiden",,Dovilė Rimkutė,,,,,,,,Dovilė Rimkutė,,European Union,Public Administration,Decision Making,Experimental Design,,,,,Explaining bureaucratic responsiveness: A vignette study of EU agencies’ prioritization judgments and decision-making processes,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65495&EventID=185
0,"CO2 prices are considered one of the most effective but also one of the most controversial climate policy instruments facing political backlash from both voters and important interest groups (e.g., producers of CO2-intensive goods). Here, we focus on the puzzling case of CO2 price adoption in Germany. In 2019, the German government adopted a CO2 price in the transport and building sector despite any agreement in the governmental coalition treaty to do so. 

We use a mixed-method policy-process tracing approach to explain why this sudden policy change came about. Integrating public opinion research into the actor coalition framework (ACF), we are specifically interested in the role of interacting public opinion and advocacy coalition change in the policy process. Here, we test the argument that the sudden increase in the public salience of the climate change issue (mainly driven by the rise of the Fridays for Future movement) served as a shock to the policy subsystem and enabled policy entrepreneurs to shift the public discourse and actor beliefs towards the necessity of adopting CO2 prices in the transport and building sector.  

Methodologically, we contribute to the literature by combining qualitative process tracing with quantitative discourse network and quasi-experimental methods. We can build on a rich data set of elite network and public opinion surveys, media, and parliamentary discourse network data, and expert interviews. Specifically, we disentangle the endogenous relationship of elite actor and public opinion change by applying a novel approach of integrating quasi-experimental and network-based methods. We conduct a difference-in-difference analysis based on the trends of discourse network measures related to the CO2 price and similar climate policy instruments before and after the public opinion shock (e.g., by measuring the congruence of actors within a discourse coalition via network densities over time on CO2 prices and phase-out of fossil-fueled cars). In combination with our survey-based and interview evidence, this novel approach allows us to empirically disentangle the extent to which public opinion change led to changes in actor coalitions and vice versa. 

Overall, we hope that our mixed-method study makes several contributions: First, theoretically, by better integrating existing public opinion research in the ACF framework. Second, methodologically, by using a mixed-method approach that combines process-tracing, quasi-experimental and network-based methods. Third, practically, by explaining the sudden adoption of CO2 prices in one of the key global economies and international climate mitigation players.",Universität Bern,Mercator Research Institute on Global Commons and Climate Change - MCC Berlin,Universität Bern,Universität Bern,Hertie School,,,,Universität Bern,,Lukas Fesenfeld,Christian Flachsland,Karin Ingold,Marlene Kammerer,Sebastian Levi,,,,Lukas Fesenfeld,,Environmental Policy,Political Economy,Climate Change,Policy Change,Empirical,,,,Explaining CO2 price adoption: The interaction between public opinion and advocacy coalition change,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65587&EventID=185
0,"In this paper, we examine how the global oil industry, as one of the main historical contributors to anthropogenic climate change, reacts to and strategises in the face of an ongoing global Energy System Transformation (EST). We focus on National Oil Companies (NOCs) in particular, because of their central role in the global energy system. Even though NOCs hold 2/3 of global oil reserves and account for 58 percent of global oil production, the energy transitions literature has so far predominantly focused its analytical lens on NOCs’ publicly-traded counterparts, so-called International Oil Companies. Climate change is among the largest crises facing humanity, governments and institutions globally are largely failing to engage NOCs in their transition strategies. Our study deals with this governance gap by analyzing the factors explaining the differences and similarities in transition strategies among 13 NOCs across several and countries and continents. Building on theoretical insights from international political economy, international business, and strategy literature, we develop an analytical framework that positions NOCs across a ‘Transition Strategy Continuum’ and formulate a set of hypotheses that we test through a fuzzy set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA). This study and its findings contribute to and expand the scholarly debate on the EST by highlighting how state-connected business actors react to and strategise in the face of the climate crisis. In doing so, we argue that NOCs should not be treated as a monolithic bloc, rather they should be viewed as diverse group of business actors with varied energy strategies that respond and adjust to the global environment populated by other state and non-state actors.",University of Warwick,Simon Fraser University,,,,,,,University of Warwick,,Mathieu Blondeel,Anastasia Ufimtseva,,,,,,,Mathieu Blondeel,,Political Economy,Investment,Climate Change,Energy,Energy Policy,,,,Explaining divergence in transition strategies between National Oil Companies,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65252&EventID=185
0,"Discursive opportunities have often been suggested as an alternative to political opportunities in explaining the contextual determinants of far right mobilization. This paper argues that existing applications of the discursive opportunity framework fail to take into account endogenous processes of interpretation, and how far right actors shift between discursive contexts. In the absence of these discussions, it is difficult to answer why largely similar actors, with similar goals, may diverge greatly in their choices of tactics. Applying the argument to three empirical case studies from the years around the so-called “refugee crisis”, the paper shows how different interpretations of discursive opportunities led local NIMBY groups, the Sweden Democrats, and the transnational Generation Identity to pursue very different strategies and to locate themselves on very different geographical and political scales in their campaigns against migrant accommodation. While these different interpretations can partly be explained by properties that were endogenous to the groups (goals, ideology, identities), they also related to the actions of other actors acting in the same contexts. The article thereby calls for a more thoroughly multi-level and relational understanding of the mechanisms that determine the effects of discursive opportunities on political protest.",Malmö University College,Aalborg Universitet,,,,,,,Aalborg Universitet,,Måns Lundstedt,Anita Nissen,,,,,,,Anita Nissen,,Immigration,Political Activism,Protests,,,,,,Explaining diverse far-right strategies: The interpretation of multi-level discursive opportunities during the “refugee crisis”,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=66392&EventID=185
0,"Research on issue ownership – parties’ reputation of competence in handling specific issues – has rapidly expanded over the past decade. While issue ownership has long been considered a stable attribute of parties, recent studies have documented the dynamic nature of individual voters’ perceptions of party issue competence and have demonstrated that voters who change their issue ownership attributions are more prone to change their party vote accordingly. Despite the electoral consequences of a voter’s changing issue ownership perceptions, little is known about the sources of such instability. So far, the emerging literature has mainly focused on the role of campaign information, but has neglected the role of individual-level factors. This paper tackles this gap and brings in the role of the accessibility of voters’ issue ownership perceptions. For voters with more accessible perceptions, it is immediately clear who the most competent party is, while voters with less accessible attitudes have to think longer before they can identify an issue-owning party. We contend that more accessible competence perceptions are more stable. Furthermore, this accessibility effect should be more pronounced for voters who do not identify with the party that they deem most competent, and for party-issue pairs that correspond to long-standing party reputations on the aggregate level (e.g. the Greens and the environment). Empirically, we measure the accessibility of voters’ issue ownership perceptions by survey response times.

0,"This paper argues that parliamentarianism strengthens party organization and party unity. The reason is that parliamentary elections and the behavior of parties in parliament are crucial for parties to assume power, which in turn means that party organization has direct effects on the probability of getting into office. I test the argument by employing a new data set on the historical evolution of parliamentarianism in Europe up until today that I link to V-Dem’s data on party development. Graphically and quantitatively, I show that as a response to the development of parliamentarianism in different European countries, party organization developed. The results hold even when accounting for other factors such as suffrage and electoral rules. My argument is further corroborated by the finding that the effect of parliamentary development is the strongest on party organization in parliament. The results shed light on the differences in party organization between parliamentary and presidential systems, suggesting that these are explained by the difference in parliament’s role in government formation and termination between the two systems, and that the type of regime thus explains the strength of party organization rather than vice versa.",Lunds Universitet,,,,,,,,Lunds Universitet,,Simon Davidsson,,,,,,,,Simon Davidsson,,Executives,Parliaments,Party Systems,,,,,,Explaining the Development of Party Organization: A Regime Perspective,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=62235&EventID=185

Despite the stated goal of the Commission’s Better Regulation Agenda (BRA) to improve and increase citizens’ participation in its policy formulation processes through online public consultations and feedback mechanisms, we currently lack a systematic analysis of the factors shaping and driving citizen’s participation in the formulation stages of supranational policymaking. This study asks which factors shape and explain the presence and extent of citizen participation in the European Commission’s consultation regime across policy initiatives and policy areas? The paper combines more traditional theories of citizen participation with theories of interest group mobilization in order to examine empirically and answer this research question. This paper argues that the complexity and salience of the policy issues consulted on is likely to affect the mobilization of citizens, as well as the resource-intensity of the consultation format. The paper also considers the impact of the Commission’s active efforts to mobilize and encourage citizen participation on their actual involvement in policymaking.

0,"In regulatory regimes regulatory agencies are crucial actors in regulatory decision-making. However, despite the regulatory agencies’ status and autonomy, the overall performance of a regulatory regime also depends on the relations and cooperation between the regulatory agency, the political actors and administrative actors, as the latter set legislative boundaries to regulatory actions and ask for accountability, but in some regulatory regimes also share some regulatory decision making with the agency. So the extent to which regime actors have high trust and low distrust in these three core actors, being the legislative politicians, the administrative actors like ministries and other executive bodies, and the regulatory agency, matters for the functioning of the regime, just like the extent to which politicians, administrative actors and decision makers in regulatory agencies trust each other.

0,"This paper addresses beliefs about one of the key debates at the core of politics: what causes inequalities in societal outcomes? Are they consequences of unequal opportunities, requiring changes in underlying structures and redistribution of outcomes? Or do they reflect differences in effort and work, making the case for redistribution weaker? Political scientists have paid little attention to how such inequality beliefs influence citizen evaluations of the political system. This paper asks two questions: first, are people’s explanations for inequality related to their perceptions of the efficacy of the political system? We propose a positive relationship: individual and meritocratic explanations, such as hard work and ambition, are associated with greater belief that the government will respond to citizens’ demands. Second, we ask: does one set of beliefs influence the other? We argue that explanations for inequality are core ideological beliefs that should influence less central beliefs such as external political efficacy. The degree of meritocracy may also be considered a policy outcome, whose realisation will influence citizens’ belief in the functioning of democracy. As such, we expect a stronger positive relationship between individual explanations for inequality and external political efficacy when people are primed on the former than when they are primed on the latter. To test these hypotheses, we fielded a question order experiment among a representative sample of the population in Britain. The findings show that, as predicted, there is a positive relationship between individual explanation for inequality and external political efficacy. However, counter to our expectations, the relationship is stronger when people are primed on external political efficacy than when they are primed on explanations for inequality.",University College Dublin,University of Strathclyde,University of Strathclyde,LSE,,,,,University of Strathclyde,,Alona Dolinsky,Joe Greenwood-Hau,Stefanie Reher,Christine Stedtnitz,,,,,Stefanie Reher,,Political Economy,Political Psychology,Public Opinion,Survey Experiments,,,,,Explanations for Inequality and External Political Efficacy,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65982&EventID=185
0,"There has been no large-scale co-research with vocational school students where they are as equals, not research subjects. There is therefore no protocol. The protocol was created by Meriläinen for her theoretical-empirical research (2020; 2021; 2022). The explorative co-research with vocational school students focused on power relations in the society. The purpose of the explorative empirical research method was to gain empirical research data from the students in an active manner – rather than just by observing or testing them. There were no hypotheses or expected outcome(s), in order to keep an open mind in the explorative research setting. The only expectation was, if the young vocational school students were willing to be voluntary co-researchers, that empirical data must be gained, though the nature of the possible empirical data was unknown. This further emphasised the explorative nature of the research. Naturally power-relations exists in the explorative empirical research, since the adult researcher has the education (PhD.) and experience to do research, while the young co-researcher may be unfamiliar with the research method, purposes, and topics. Indeed co-research was unknown to all n=213 voluntary co-researchers. The method, research and purpose were discussed on multiple occasions with the young people.
As a premise, if researchers seek to gain insights from people, they should listen to people in their own surroundings and go where those people are. In this case: vocational schools. Research-workshops were chosen as a process for gathering research data because students can be engaged in schools, and workshops at their best can be conducted in open and free atmospheres and surroundings that are different from the setting of traditional classroom teaching. The workshops were designed to fit the existing curriculum in multiple municipalities and research subjects. The workshops lasted between 35 mins to almost 4 hours long, with some cases lunch breaks and the general freedom to move, drink and eat. 
Eventually there were seven different main ways for the co-researchers to participate: from independent research to simply discussing with the adult researcher in a free atmosphere. These seven ways were formulated in co-operation with the co-researchers in developing the research method. To ensure equal possibilities to participate online and offline, participatory methods were created to help those with various disabilities or language barriers or who experience anxiety. Help was also provided when needed.
Few key issues must be addressed. Anonymity is crucial, since it allows young participants to express their opinions freely while producing empirical research data. Moreover, it is important to address ethical issues such as disabilities, differences in language skills, accessing information, and to consider time constraints, and the possible hurdles of using minorities as tokens in research. 

As two co-researchers said: “No one has ever come to question anything so profoundly. I feel like this should happen more often. It would be good for us to be listened to and we can talk about this.”

0,"The use of social media for lobbying draws increasing interest. Most studies have focused on the role of social media in outside lobbying (e.g., Kanol & Nat 2017; Vesa et al. 2022) or on interest organizations’ use of social media in general (e.g., Scaramuzzino & Scaramuzzino 2017; Van der Graaf et al. 2016). Less is known about the use of social media for direct lobbying (but see Chalmers & Shotton 2016; Halpin et al. 2021; Widner et al. 2020), where for example Twitter enables a type of “middle-stage lobbying”, in which lobbyists target policymakers directly in front of a limited audience (Figenschou & Fredheim 2020). Another research gap is that studies on the role of social media in lobbying have primarily focused on interest groups, such as NGOs, labor unions, and business associations (but see Van der Graaf et al. 2016). Less is known about the role of social media in the lobby efforts of firms. This is surprising as research has highlighted the important role of individual firms as lobbyist in pluralist systems (e.g., Gray et al. 2004) as well as in corporatist systems (Aizenberg & Hanegraaff 2020). 

To fill these two gaps, this paper asks: To what extent do corporate representatives use social media for direct lobbying and what factors explain variation in their activity? Our analysis draws on a sample of large corporations operating in Finland, Denmark and the Netherlands. The analysis examines how in-house lobbyists and executive-level employees of large corporations use Twitter for direct lobbying and what factors can account for variation in this. Specifically, we use the Twitter API to identify in-house lobbyists and executives that follow political accounts (those of parliamentarians, ministries, and political parties). To identify direct lobbying on Twitter, we analyze corporate employees’ interactions with political accounts during a selected period: retweets, quote retweets, tweets with mentions, replies, and likes. To distinguish between pure networking and substantial lobbying related to political issues we utilize computational methods (such as naïve Bayes classifier). 

Our goal is to explain variation in the extent of corporate representatives’ interaction with political accounts – i.e., direct Twitter lobbying – by factors such as revenue, staff size, type of ownership, type of industry and country level factors. In the presentation, we will also discuss some challenges of studying direct Twitter lobbying, such as identifying organizations’ employees in the absence of historical Twitter bios and the challenges in classifying different types of interactions with policymakers.

0,"Cash assistance programs have gained significant popularity in recent years, particularly in the international aid sector, as an effective strategy for development and poverty reduction in low-income countries. Whilst in many cases these programs are implemented without state involvement, donors also aim to persuade governments to take more ownership. 
Recent literature has shed light on the political dimensions of implementing cash assistance reform in collaboration with semi-authoritarian regimes. Semi-authoritarian regimes, which can be defined as having characteristics of both liberal-democratic and authoritarian regimes, tend to follow the political imperative of regime survival, and are likely to only implement policies that align to this imperative. In response, the aid sector is increasingly employing more politically engaged approaches to aid delivery to persuade semi-authoritarian regimes to implement cash assistance programs. These types of approaches aim to understand the political economy context, and work within its constraints to find politically viable options for policy reform. This has led to a number of success cases. 
However, in judging the merits of these cash assistance programs, too much focus has been on concrete, short term results, particularly the buy-in from semi-authoritarian regimes and the livelihood-related outcomes for beneficiaries. But the compromises that had to be struck in the process, as well as the broader political consequences of donor-funded, state-led cash assistance programs, remain under-explored. 
This paper engages with the above issues through three case studies of cash assistance programs in semi-authoritarian regimes in Africa: Egypt, Ethiopia, and Uganda. It asks the questions: how does donors' engagement in supporting cash assistance programs impact the political landscape in semi-authoritarian hybrid regimes? And what are the trade-offs and dilemmas faced by donors in these processes? It finds that politically engaged strategies by donors around the political survival imperatives of ruling elites in each country were crucial in securing the needed commitment to implement the cash assistance programs. However, this political pragmatism came with inevitable trade-offs and dilemmas that have resulted in both pro- and anti-poor outcomes. It concludes that while the political-engagement agenda has been instrumental in reshaping how donors approach the early stages of program adoption in intractable contexts, there’s still a significant political blind-spot in approaching the broader, downstream outcomes of these strategies.","Department of Public Administration, Erasmus University Rotterdam",Erasmus University,"Department of Public Administration, Erasmus University Rotterdam",,,,,,Erasmus University,,Ahmed Elassal,Guido Maschhaupt,Petronilla Wandeto,,,,,,Guido Maschhaupt,,Africa,Civil Society,Development,Governance,Political Economy,,,,"Exploring donor trade-offs in semi-authoritarian regimes: political consequences of cash assistance programs in Egypt, Ethiopia, and Uganda",https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64429&EventID=185
0,"Energy communities are taking on a growingly prominent role in future climate governance systems. This is particularly true for how these self-organized and local-scale manifestations of the energy transition are institutionalized throughout the European Union. The implementation of the Clean Energy for all Europeans package into national contexts creates a peculiar heterogenization of energy community models in the European context arguably creating a polycentric network of initiatives. These community models are embedded in a polycentric setting characterized by a growing number of governance levels, varied decision-making centers and domains of action, as well as the growingly codified set of overarching rules. With-in this framing the question remains as to how small- and local scale action can be aggregated into effective climate mitigation. Against this backdrop, the paper investigates to what extent scaling mechanisms need to be considered when planning for the institutional context of diversifying energy community models. By conducting a Qualitative Comparative Analysis of energy communities across Europe we find a number of scaling mechanisms at play – and in particular diverse combinations, which lead to scaling. Accordingly, we assess the scaling of energy communities at three levels. We explore firstly how communities organize with-in, secondly how they interact between communities, and finally what type of context the communities are embedded in. Our results indicate that diverse energy community models result in a variety of scaling pathways as well as particular combinations of scaling mechanisms in the process. We sketch the relevance of our findings for two bodies of literature which are often invoked in these debates: strategic niche management approach and polycentric governance, and see great potential for enhancing currently existing frameworks there.",University of Amsterdam,Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam,Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam,,,,,,Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam,,Mendel Giezen,Dave Huitema,Daniel Petrovics,,,,,,Daniel Petrovics,,Environmental Policy,Qualitative Comparative Analysis,Energy Policy,,,,,,Exploring Scaling Mechanisms of Energy Communities,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63428&EventID=185

We also study the features of MPs representing the demoi (party, language group) and, as Belgium is a dual federation, regarding the kind of demoi that are represented (territorially- or language-based). Our results show that representation of the demoi indeed increased over time, overall exceeds the representation of the demos, and that Dutch-speaking and nationalist MPs represent the demoi most often. Also, after the fourth state reform, representation of the demoi is mostly territory-based. We conclude that the increasing representation of the demoi at the expense of the demos in the House of Representatives poses a democratic deficit as federal systems require representation of both the demos and the demoi at the federal level, the House being the chamber that is meant to represent the people.",Universiteit Antwerpen,Universiteit Antwerpen,,,,,,,Universiteit Antwerpen,,Jakob Frateur,Peter Bursens,,,,,,,Jakob Frateur,,Democracy,Federalism,Parliaments,Representation,Empirical,,,,Exploring the effects of territorial reform on the representation of the people: the case of the Belgian House of Representatives,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64395&EventID=185
0,"This paper explores the role of political awareness (PA) in youth’ political behaviour.  The analysis builds on political awareness (PA) as three dimensions, political attention, political knowledge and political understanding. The concept of PA is understood as a ‘reservoir of predispositions’, which citizens use to understand political messages communicated in public, in interpersonal relations and discussions and active participation in political affairs. We assume that PA is vital when they sort out information and prepare their political choices.  After developing this new operationalization of PA it is important to explore how PA predicts political values, attitudes and behaviour. 

The current article builds on the previous conceptual development and explores how PA as a latent variable predicts internal political efficacy and political participation in elections as well as other less specific forms of political involvement.

0,"The Energy-Stability-Area (ESA) model of organisational density and diversity (Gray and Lowery 1996; Lowery and Gray 1995) since its inception has become the main population ecology model explaining the size of interest group populations. While the conceptualisation and measurement of the energy and area terms have become ever more sophisticated, the stability term is mostly left out altogether. Following Olson (1982), the stability term was conceptualised by Gray and Lowery (1996) as a profound change to the polity such as a political regime change, foreign occupation, and secession from or integration into a new state. Olson (1982) assumed that after such major disruptions to the political system, interest group formation begins anew and continues exponentially until another major disruption. The population ecology models of the vital rates of interest groups (Lowery and Gray 1996, Hannan and Carrol 1992) refuted the assumption of exponential growth in organisational densities. Nevertheless, Olson’s assumption of disruption and growth after a profound polity level change were never tested. 

Gray and Lowery (1996) conceptualised the stability term as the age of the interest group system, that is, the time since the respective states joined the Union. However, they noted that they did not expect any meaningful effect, as unless one assumes a century-long time lag, stability could not be relevant for their empirical cases (the contemporary American states). Indeed, the stability term is in this setting constant. Studying the determinants of the densities of healthcare, higher education, and energy policy interest group populations in four post-communist EU member states, Labanino et al. (2021a), however, conceptualised the stability term as the ratio of pre-transition (1989) and contemporary (2018) population densities. The analysis found a curvilinear relationship between 1989 and 2018 densities. However, the study did not explore the causal process linking the effect of 1989 densities on the number post-transition organisations. 

As our population ecology dataset contains the formation and dissolution rates of a total of 52 energy policy, higher education, and healthcare populations across four countries (Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, and Slovenia) between 1989 and 2019, we can model how the 1989 population size affects the vital rates of post-transition populations through time. We measure the number and the ratio of communist-era organizations, respectively on yearly formation rates (and where possible, on mortality rates), and explore the implications on density dependence. Our analysis rests on the assumption that communist era and post-transition organizations follow different advocacy strategies (Gallai et al. 2015), and on the observed lower mortality rates of communist era organizations (Labanino et al. 2021b). We also test alternative time-series models, following the structural model of the POS framework (Meyer and Minkoff 2004). Our study contributes to population ecology models beyond an alternative conceptualisation and measurement of the stability term.

0,"Arctic regionalism, as well as its role in a globalized world has been a major point of interest of the Northern political scientists for over three decades now. Its scholars can be roughly divided into two camps: for some the Arctic is an exceptional space of peaceful cooperation “detached from global political dynamics” (Käpylä & Mikkola, 2015), others claim that as any other region is influenced by the global politics and can be vulnerable to a (for example Ukrainian) conflict spill-over (Rahbek-Clemmensen, 2016). But eventually many agree – the Arctic is a unique region with its particular forms of cooperation and governance.
Following the Ukrainian crisis many of the high-level dialogues and programs between Russia and the Western countries were suspended. Nevertheless, in the high North, their cooperation via the regional councils and other multilateral mechanisms has continued. Is that due to the high-level of complex interdependence achieved in the region (Byers, 2017, 2019), certain “preconditions” for a “high geopolitical stability” (Heininen, 2018), or whether the regional cooperation works precisely because the Arctic regime was “deliberately negotiated in a way that promotes cooperation” (Exner-Pirot and Murray, 2017).
The paper explores theoretical and conceptual perspectives on the influence of the external international shocks, such as Ukrainian crisis, on the Arctic governance, seeks to understand how the region was built to be resilient to the conflict, and ultimately, suggesting that the Arctic is indeed a part of the globalized world, explores the relation between regionalism and the world politics.",Université de Liège,,,,,,,,Université de Liège,,Nina Lavrenteva,,,,,,,,Nina Lavrenteva,,Conflict,International Relations,Regionalism,,,,,,External international shocks’ impact on regional governance: Ukrainian crisis spill-over in the Arctic.,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64171&EventID=185

This paper will examine the impact of extreme weather on clientelism, a form of particularistic exchange in which voters are induced to eschew policy-oriented electoral decision-making in favour of voting for a party or candidate that offers them an individual reward. We hypothesize that extreme weather should increase clientelism in contexts where it operates, and that this effect should work via both supply-side and demand-side channels. We test our expectations on recent quantitative and qualitative data from Honduras. We analyse data from the 2018 LAPOP survey to probe clientelism assessments of the 2017 general election by means of both coarsened exact matching and an unexpected event in survey design (UESD).

0,"Social movements' ability to attract public support depends on the character and actions of radical factions inside the movements. Yet, the notion of radicalism has remained debated in the literature. Some authors have favored a definition centered on extremist beliefs while others have focused on violent tactics. These conceptual disagreements are reflected in the conflicting evidence in the literature: some studies have found a negative effect of radical flanks on public support, others a positive effect. This paper seeks to bring more clarity to this topic by examining the distinct impacts of different types of radical flanks on public support. Using a nationally representative survey experiment about protest against the COVID-19 containment measures in Germany, I tested the causal effects of two types of radical factions – one defined as groups with extremist beliefs (right-wing extremists) and the other defined as groups that resort to violence – as well as the interaction of these two types. Three forms of public support were examined: 1) the feelings towards the protesters, 2) the sympathy for their demands, and (3) the support for a ban on future demonstrations by the same group. I also tested how visual cues in the form of photos modify reactions to the presence of a right-wing extremist flank. The results indicated that the use of violence by a radical faction has a siginificant negative impact on feelings towards the protesters and increases support for a demonstration ban. The presence of radicals with an extremist ideology and the interaction of the two types of radicalism (extremist beliefs and violent tactics), however, did not have a significant impact on public support.

0,"The policymaking context to address climate change is characterised by multilevel reinforcing governance dynamics between the local, national, regional (e.g., EU) and international level. While our understanding of the role, relevance and impact of learning has improved on the European and national level, we lack a clearer understanding of the central co-ordinating role of the international level of environmental governance through the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) negotiations. This contribution explores how the process of learning affects and is affected by the dynamic interactions with and within the policymaking context of the UNFCCC negotiations and the multilevel reinforcing dynamics with the sub-national, national and EU levels. As the formal negotiations on the Paris Agreement on climate change and its implementation are in the final concluding stages, the focus of the international community moves towards increasing countries’ ambitions in addressing climate change through national-level policies. This transforms the role of the UNFCCC into a learning forum. Based on interviews and participant observation between 2015 and 2021, this paper process-traces how the UNFCCC is emerging as a learning forum and assuming a co-ordinating role on the international level while closely interacting with the local, national and regional levels of governance.

0,"This paper presents a mixed methods approach to understanding the role of situated agency in multilevel and networked governance systems, combining network and discourse analyses. The paper is based on second-stage analysis of quantitative and qualitative data collected within the frames of the research project entitled Facilitating policy change for low-carbon mobility: The Role of Multilevel Governance, funded by the Centre for Research into Energy Demand Solutions (CREDS). The project takes the case of the multilevel governance of transport decarbonisation in the United Kingdom, focusing on the city regions of Cambridge and Birmingham, with the analysis aiming at exposing areas where governance networks could be better facilitated to enable effective and transformative policy change towards low-carbon mobility.
Analyses of multilevel governance systems, consisting of societal actors operating at and between different political-organisational scales (supra-national, national, regional, local), is a growing area of focus in transport studies. However, the majority of studies focus on the formal, structural characteristics of multi-level systems, such as the diversity and number of institutions involved in decision-making, and their authority and responsibilities. Interpretive accounts exploring the perceived positions of actors within multilevel and networked settings, and associated beliefs and narratives, are still lacking. In this paper we argue that is a crucial gap in understanding how different actors plot courses of action, influence network dynamics and ultimately affect policy change.
In order to support this argument, we bring evidence from two city regions in the UK: Birmingham and Cambridge. Despite crucial differences in terms of urban form, density, local economies and governance arrangements, both city regions are grappling with high car dependency, congestion, air pollution and high emissions from transport. Quantitative (organisational) network analysis is used to reveal disjunctures between network structures as understood formally and as understood by the actors themselves. Formal networks are reconstructed from written sources such as organisational websites, municipal reports and policy documents, and previous studies. Informal networks are reconstructed from data gathered through interviews with key actors, including elected politicians, policymakers from local transport authorities, regional energy distributors, transport operators, infrastructure developers, charities and activist groups. Qualitative discourse analysis (based on both secondary and primary sources) is used in tandem to uncover how context-specific beliefs and narratives of these actors contribute to their views on their positions within the network, and their perceived ability to affect change.
The network and discourse analyses highlight a variety of different causes and perspectives on governing transport decarbonisation in the two city regions. However, they also call attention to an important similarity: difficulties with mobilising civil society, and working with activist groups and community organisations to deliver transformative change. This is a common issue despite the prevalence of ‘partnership’ rhetoric, and the abundance of community initiatives, in both places. Prioritising building better relationships with influential activist groups and community organisations may therefore facilitate more effective governance towards low-carbon mobility. Our research in turn highlights the value of network analysis as a method to identify such influential organisations and opportunities for intervention.",University of Birmingham,University of Birmingham,University of Cambridge,,,,,,University of Birmingham,,Timea Nochta,Louise Reardon,Li Wan,,,,,,Timea Nochta,,Governance,Local Government,Climate Change,Mixed Methods,Policy Change,Energy Policy,Influence,,Facilitating policy change for low-carbon mobility - A network approach,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65426&EventID=185

0,"This study draws on energy justice research to examine existing notions of justice in two regions in Germany where conflicts over energy transition measures take place. Arguing that negotiations on a fair energy transition process inherit political and social conflict potential, this article analyses the perceptions of justice to identify mobilisation and conflict issues in the field using three core tenets of justice (distributive justice, procedural justice and justice-based recognition) as an analytical framework. In order to gain an impression of the spectrum of justice negotiations and to investigate whether indications for conflict issues exist, we compared two regions that are affected by energy transition measures with diverging levels of invasiveness. The first case is the district of Ahrweiler, which is affected by the conversion of an existing power line and is, thus, objectively being a measure with a rather low impact on the region and the people living there. As a second case, we look at Lusatia, which is facing major structural changes due to the local coal phase-out. Using an extensive qualitative data set, the perceptions of justice of those not involved in the conflicts are analysed, which enables the comparison of the regional justice discourses. By undertaking the comparison, we provide a first overview of the range of justice negotiations and examine the differences and commonalities which hint at local and national mobilisation and conflict potentials.

0,"Much of the philosophical debate about fake news concerns its definition, whether or not it is believed by those who read it, and what the duties of news readers are to ensure they do not fall prey to misinformation. However, at a fundamental level, fake news is a problem for democratic systems because it can cause damage regardless of whether its content is believed. The mere knowledge of the prevalence of fake news threatens to undermine epistemic trust of citizens in each other and (by extension) their democratic system. At this fundamental level, philosophical concern should thus be targeted at the crucial importance of a sound informational environment for democracies. Plausible obligations for institutions in this respect include e.g. media literacy training of citizens via public education. But importantly, a fundamental role for a healthy information environment that informs democratic discourse and counters the threat of fake news falls to independent public broadcasters, or so I shall argue. Spelling out the case for public broadcast in the fight against fake news is crucial because such media are either underfunded and thus relatively ineffective (USA), or threatened in their existence due to partisan political agendas (UK), or their relevance is increasingly doubted (Germany) even though they currently present important voices in the media landscape. I will philosophically explain the moral relevance of independent public broadcast in securing the informational environment of democracies, and this is thus a timely topic even though it is not often associated with the problem of fake news.",University of Birmingham,,,,,,,,University of Birmingham,,Merten Reglitz,,,,,,,,Merten Reglitz,,Democracy,Media,Television,Public Opinion,,,,,"Fake news, epistemic trust in democracies, and the crucial role of independent public broadcast",https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64500&EventID=185
0,"Despite its limited effectiveness to date, economists continue to claim that carbon pricing is optimal for climate
policy. As climate policy becomes more urgent, it is crucial to understand whether this optimality claim holds.
We show how optimality is contingent upon normative premises of what constitutes well-being and politics. The
optimality claim can only be sustained if well-being is conceptualized as preference satisfaction and politics is
narrowly understood as the sphere within which social conflicts are resolved via efficient resource allocation.
Both premises are contested, however. If well-being is understood as human need satisfaction, sustainable
consumption corridors can be conceived as optimal. Alternative understandings of politics imply that carbon
pricing requires revenue redistribution or an embedding in deliberative processes to become optimal, or might
not be optimal at all. Based on the conceptual strengths of alternative views of well-being and politics, we
illuminate blind spots in the theoretical case for carbon pricing. At the policy level, carbon pricing overlooks
qualitative differences in economic production and the systemic nature of fossil fuel dependence. It bears little
relation to the Earth’s biophysical limits or social justice. At the level of politics, focusing on carbon pricing fails
to provide procedures beyond the market to address social conflicts. In particular, from a radical democratic
view, carbon pricing represents a sustainability fix which stabilizes the fossil economy. Sustainable consumption
corridors are in a much better position to re-politicize and ultimately deconstruct the hegemony of the fossil
economy.",University of Duisburg-Essen,,,,,,,,University of Duisburg-Essen,,Vera Huwe,,,,,,,,Vera Huwe,,Conflict Resolution,Green Politics,Political Theory,Climate Change,Ethics,,,,Far from optimal?

0,"Reactionary and far right creators have established a strong presence on YouTube, becoming political influencers and disseminating their ideas to a wide audience. YouTube has been demonstrated to be a pipeline of extremism, funneling viewers towards the far right through a combination of algorithms, platforms norms, and presenter practices. A number of these YouTubers have unaffiliated fan communities on Reddit where users congregate to discuss and disseminate content. However, research on the far right on YouTube tends to focus predominantly on the presenters themselves or YouTube comments in isolation.
 
Focusing on Tim Pool and his fan community on Reddit, this paper offers an understanding of the discursive interaction between a far right content creator and their receptive audience. Through a mixed methods approach of inter- and intra-platform discourse analysis in conjunction with SNA, this paper will elaborate on the discursive negotiation of identity, and ideas such as democracy, during the US 2020 Presidential Election and attempted insurrection. With Pool deemed a ‘superspreader’ of election misinformation (EIP 2021) and a ‘sanitised conduit to the far right’ (Silverman 2021) it is critical to understand how discourse evolves and is received by the users most aligned with him.

While some research has seen fear as the main driver for far-right and anti-islamic mobilization (Ekman 2015, Wodak 2015), recent contributions have argued that anger is the driving force of far-right support (Vasilopoulos et al. 2018). Anger has also been found to be crucial to both engagement in online debates and to the creation of online echo chambers (Wollebæk et al. 2019). This paper contributes to this research by going beyond survey data and directly studying the emotional content of the posts in prominent Scandinavian far-right Facebook groups. Sentiment analysis is used to identify the emotional content of one year worth of posts of multiple groups in each country. This is used to investigate the multitude of emotional reactions in the far-right mobilization, not only fear and anger (Lesser and Spissinger 2020).

0,"The question of which, if any, feasibility constraints should be imposed on normative or evaluative claims is one of the central methodological questions in political theory. As part of that broader question, there is an on-going discussion concerning the feasibility constraints we should impose on claims about human rights. Central to this debate is the question whether we should reject the claim that there is a human right to X if it is not possible to secure the fulfillment of this right for all or most people. Indeed, this kind of feasibility argument has often been used to cast doubt on the existence of socio-economic rights in particular.
The paper seeks to contribute to the debate over the feasibility of human rights in three different ways:
1.	First, it aims to show that there are two different types of question involved in discussions of the feasibility of human rights. On the one hand, the questions raised concerning feasibility in political theory in general have applications for the feasibility of human rights. In particular, the question of whether feasibility should be seen as synchronic or diachronic is central to solutions to the feasibility challenge proposed by e.g. Amartya Sen and Pablo Gilabert. On the other hand, there are questions that are more specific to the feasibility of human rights, which concern what we may callthe de-composition of human rights. A human right may be de-composed into a cluster of claim rights held by all human beings and in order to settle whether a human right is feasible, one needs to know how to go from claims about the feasibility of individual claim-rights to claims about the feasibility of the human right as such. 

2.	Next, the paper explores some difficulties in answering both of these questions concerning the feasibility of human rights. Concerning the first question, the paper argues that a diachronic approach to the feasibility of human rights will be insufficiently determinate to settle the question of which human rights people have today. Concerning the second question, the paper suggests that there is no obvious way of going from claims about the feasibility of specific claim-rights to claims about the feasibility of human rights. Common to these difficulties is that the claim that a human right is feasible or not will appear to be to some degree arbitrary.

3.	Thirdly, the paper will consider the objection that there is a tension between a common defense of the feasibility of human rights – which consists in saying that a human right is feasible if its fulfillment can be secured by a plurality of actors – and the ideal that a claim about human rights should be action-guiding. From the point of view of an individual agent who seeks to know which human rights there are as a basis for deciding what to do, it will in some cases be indeterminate what human rights there are as long as their feasibility depends on the actions of a large number of actors.",Universitetet i Oslo,,,,,,,,Universitetet i Oslo,,Jakob Elster,,,,,,,,Jakob Elster,,Human Rights,Political Theory,Methods,Ethics,,,,,Feasibility constraints on human rights,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64574&EventID=185
0,"Researching and studying the Islamic movement in Turkey has developed significantly in recent decades; next to different theoretical departures and methodologies used by scholars to better analyse and decipher the dimensions of Turkey’s Islamic movement, its actors as well its plurality in terms of action and ideology, there still exists the challenge of how to study and teach this (or make it accessible to a greater audience) in a way that is accurate, fruitful and also attractive.

Orhan Pamuk’s novel SNOW can be used as an excellent key to the understanding of the various aspects and dimensions of the Islamic movement in contemporary Turkey, as he has created a number of characters that genuinely express the plurality of Islam and the Islamic movement in Turkish politics and society (apart from the characters who express worldviews and stances other than or opposite to Islamic ones): the young Islamist who shoots the secular Principal of the Education Institute, the two young men who study at the Islamic school, the Sheikh who comforts his audience, the man called “Blue” who is considered an Islamist terrorist by the police and tries to avoid arrest, the local active politician Muhtar, as well as the young girls who wear headscarves.

The main purpose of this paper is to show that these characters express and voice vividly and accurately the variety and plurality within the Turkish Islamic movement. Moreover, Orhan Pamuk’s shaping of his Islamic characters (their words, beliefs and actions) can be seen clearly as a typology of the Turkish Islamic movement, comparable to typologies suggested by political and social scientists.",National and Kapodistrian University of Athens,,,,,,,,National and Kapodistrian University of Athens,,Konstantinos Gogos,,,,,,,,Konstantinos Gogos,,Islam,,,,,,,,Features of the Turkish Islamic Movement in Orhan Pamuk’s SNOW,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=66299&EventID=185
0,"How do federal dynamics behave in a process of democratic backsliding? This paper discusses a mechanism of the decline of the quality of democracy in a federal country, departing from the argument that federalism and democracy couple in a tense relationship, which could reinforce or hinder each other. The relationship between federalism and democracy is mediated by traditional federal elements, such as the subnational authorities, the party system, and the Upper House, among others. This paper aims to investigate how they act and interact during the process of democratic backsliding, by using process tracing and comparative historical analysis. The causal mechanism is tested in the case of the establishment of dictatorship in Brazil in the 1960s and brings insights into the current Brazilian scenario. The main findings highlight the role subnational authorities can play in the process of democratic backsliding; the features of the party system in that context; and cast doubt on the abilities of the Senate for effective territorial representation within a federation.",University of Innsbruck,,,,,,,,University of Innsbruck,,Ana Tereza Ribeiro Fernandes,,,,,,,,Ana Tereza Ribeiro Fernandes,,Democracy,Federalism,Latin America,Qualitative,,,,,FEDERAL DYNAMICS AND DEMOCRATIC BACKSLIDING: TENSIONS AND POTENTIALS IN BRAZIL,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63704&EventID=185
0,"Although citizens are crucial for the vitality and legitimacy of federal systems, citizens have only recently emerged as a focal point of federal studies. A series of studies have investigated the attitudes of citizens towards federalism and the sociological drivers behind it (Henderson et al., 2014; Verhaegen et al., 2021). Studies focus mostly on the relevance of regional identity, the levels of trust from citizens towards political/federal institutions and the impact of a regions’ wealth on the attitudes of citizens. While these citizen-based studies provide useful  insights into citizens’ attitudes and preferences on federalisation, an important question remains unresolved: the meanings and conceptions that citizens themselves attribute to federalism. Indeed, federalism is a fuzzy concept that gives rise to various and sometimes divergent definitions and approaches in the literature (Hueglin, 2013). When analysing citizens’ attitudes towards federalism, most studies tend to assume a unified understanding which glosses over the multiple and perhaps contradictory meanings which citizens associate with federalism. This is particularly true in a political environment where the notion of federalism is politicised and likely to give rise to competing views and assumptions across the population. In our article, we propose to address this gap by applying the concept of “the social imaginary”(Taylor, 2002; Van Wessel, 2010) to tap into citizens’ conceptions of federalism. This choice assumes that the attitudes and preferences of citizens vis-à-vis political institutions are not just a matter of rational interests and preferences but also deeply intertwined with their imagined ideals of a polity, their experiences, and the unmet expectations they may have when confronting their ideal perceptions to reality. Based on a series of focus groups among Flemish citizens (in 2008 and 2018), and drawing on critical frame analysis and thematic analysis, we find that, in contrast to existing literature on federalism as a tool of conflict management, citizens perceive federalism as a source of conflict and as a system that requires improvement. Furthermore, it appears that the imagined solutions are intertwined with citizens’ grievances towards and ideals of the state. Mobilising the framework of the social imaginary helps us to unpack unexplored dimensions of citizens’ attitudes towards federalism, in a context where federalism is a particularly contested and politicized issue (the Flemish-speaking community in Belgium). In addition, our paper contributes to the existing federal studies, by proposing a bottom-up and interpretative framework to study federalism, from citizens’ own words, lived experiences and stories.",Université catholique de Louvain,Vrije Universiteit Brussel,Université catholique de Louvain,Université catholique de Louvain,Université catholique de Louvain,,,,Université catholique de Louvain,,Ann-Mireille Sautter,Louise Knops,Christoph Niessen,Laura Pascolo,Min Reuchamps,,,,Ann-Mireille Sautter,,Citizenship,Federalism,Regionalism,Constructivism,Qualitative,,,,Federalism as ‘problem’ in the social imaginary of Flemish citizens,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63916&EventID=185
0,"This paper explains the radicalization of partisanship in the US emerging from the increasing influence of extreme activists and their followers against debilitated party structures.  The dynamic has been particularly acute in the Republican Party, with its base of ""grievance"" voters seeking to over-throw the establishment.  In the Republican Party, a large faction believes it faces an existential threat to their conservative and white racial identities.  For decades, traditional party leaders have become less capable of managing these tensions as a new wave of media savvy leaders (initiated by Newt Gingrich) stoked political fear and anger, rooted in religious and racial attitudes.  

A problem for the Republican Party is that traditional leadership (both elected and organizational) have lost gatekeeping power to keep out the most illiberal elements in the party.  In fact, the illiberal elements now control many party organizations at the grassroots. The loss of gatekeeping power has its roots in a century-long project of Progressives at the turn of the 20th century, trying to all but eliminate transactional political parties.  In more recent decades, campaign finance reforms intended to reduce money in politics ended up incentivizing non-transparent methods to finance campaigns, as well as judicial challenges to the law, which led to the breakdown of formal regulations.  Today, Super PACs funded by radical libertarian billionaires (and extreme and wealthy liberals on the left) now dominate the system causing greater partisan polarization.  The extremism is not mitigated by the rise of small donors who tend to favor populists like Donald Trump and ideological standard-bearers like Bernie Sanders.

The most profound effect of these changes has been on the Republican Party because its constituencies are in decline relative to groups supporting Democrats.  Under these seemingly existential conditions, the Republican Party has been overtaken by insurgents -- mostly ethno-nationalists.  Trump took over a party that was ripe for collapse. Its traditional elites - both elected and party officers -- lacked the capacity to hold norm-breaking members accountable.  Paradoxically, the weakening of the GOP and its growing illiberalism owes much to the party-weakening reforms pushed by liberal Democrats for more than a century.","University of Massachusetts, Amherst",,,,,,,,"University of Massachusetts, Amherst",,Raymond LaRaja,,,,,,,,Raymond LaRaja,,Political Participation,Political Parties,USA,Party Members,Political Ideology,Activism,,,Feeble Gatekeepers: Factional Insurgency and the Toppling of the Grand Old Party.,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=66110&EventID=185
0,"Political representation is an essential component of the liberal democratic systems we have in most of the world today. Hence, many studies have focused on whether citizens are represented by politicians in normative, descriptive, and substantive ways. Yet, we know surprisingly little about whether citizens feel represented. Constructivist scholars have further elaborated theoretically that representation is the result of a process in which linkage is created between represented and representative. Feeling represented is an essential part of establishing this representative relationship. In this paper, we operationalize “feeling represented” with insights from the literature on political representation and empirical psychology. Acknowledging the emotional application of this concept effectively goes beyond the distinction of descriptive and substantive representation and effectively builds on the constructivist turn in political representation. By incorporating cutting-edge research on psychology, especially work on affective processing, emotions and identity, this paper will pave the way in developing a valid measurement of feeling represented. Through an online survey embedded experiment, we investigate the dimensionality of the concept with an exploratory factor analysis. Hence, we contribute to knowledge on how and to what extent political representation works in practice.","Norwegian University of Science & Technology, Trondheim","Norwegian University of Science & Technology, Trondheim",,,,,,,"Norwegian University of Science & Technology, Trondheim",,Pieter De Wilde,Andrea Vik,,,,,,,Pieter De Wilde,,Political Psychology,Representation,Communication,Activism,,,,,Feeling Represented: A New Approach to Measure How Citizens Feel Represented Through Representative Claims,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64529&EventID=185
0,"Female genital mutilations are on the political agenda today. For a long time, this was not the case, such practices were mainly a topic for non-governmental organisations. In Germany, the cornerstone for this political interest was laid in the second half of the 1990s, when female genital mutilations were first on the agenda of a plenary session of the German parliament, the Bundestag. More particularly, on December 12th 1997, several Social Democratic and Green parliamentarians demanded information and accountability from the federal government. But what exactly did this discourse look like, and what circumstances favoured its emergence in this form, at that time? These, in Foucauldian terms, archaeological questions will be explored in this paper in order to grasp the rules of the constitution of the discourse and to uncover the incidents that, in the order in which they occurred, led to female genital mutilations becoming a topic of the political discourse in Germany.
The discourse on female genital mutilations is not unexplored. For the discourse in the global north, scientists have shown that it was conducted in the 19th century with a focus on mutilations of the genitalia of the country's female population. When such practices came to an end at the beginning of the 20th century, this changed both the focus and the evaluation of such practices. From then on, the discourse was conducted with a focus on practices in the global south and the otherness of practicing communities underlined. Also, the discourse in the global north diminished, until it regained strength at the end of the 20th century albeit in a modified form.
In Germany, female genital mutilations have been a political issue for three decades now, nevertheless this has not received any noteworthy attention in research so far. This is not primarily astonishing because of the time span, but because of the impact power. Discourses at the level of politics exercise a high degree of power in themselves. In addition, however, they have an effect beyond this, by being taken up by discourses in the media and everyday life. These discourses on female genital mutilations unfold their impact primarily in the lives of people who belong to a practising community or are perceived as such.
A first important step in understanding the political discourse on female genital mutilations, i.e. the development it has taken and made into what it is today and how it impacts, is its archaeological analysis.To this end, the paper will focus on the 13th legislative period (November 1994 - October 1998), the period in which the above mentioned (211th) plenary debate took place.

0,"This paper defines and explores fictional narratives (FN) as a method in moral and political philosophy. 
First, we establish storytelling as a fragmented tradition within political theory locating it in relation to, though distinct from, the method of cases and reflective equilibrium. Unlike the latter, FNs do not seek conclusive answers but investigate the plural nature of moral issues. 
Second, we unpack further what is distinct about FNs by asking ‘what do they do?’ This section examines empathy but distinguishes this from moral sentimentalism: FNs explore empathy with thought as well as feeling. 
Having established what they do, we subsequently ask ‘what are they for?’ We argue that FNs are for opening up possibilities and exploring wicked problems. We claim this helps to demonstrate or make us think about the unintended consequences of actual policies. Lastly, we recognise when FNs overlap with ethnography, but offer some instances when they may not, finally distinguishing a FN as a method in and of itself.",De Montfort University,,,,,,,,De Montfort University,,Simon Stevens,,,,,,,,Simon Stevens,,Political Theory,Critical Theory,Methods,Narratives,Normative Theory,,,,Fictional Narratives: what they are and when to use them,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63146&EventID=185
0,"There is a vast literature on the role that the media play in facilitating or hindering issue competition between mainstream parties, but very little is known on how this dynamic affects new political parties. This article examines specifically new green parties (NGPs) as a subset, as mainstream parties are compelled to respond to the increasing salience of green issues in recent decades. We are particularly interested in how the adoption of accommodative or adversarial strategies by mainstream parties and their presence in the media affects the visibility of NGPs. We hypothesize increased visibility for NGPs when mainstream parties abandon their dismissive strategies: the adoption of green issues as a talking point for mainstream parties increases issue salience and relevance of NGPs in the media. We also acknowledge, however, that changes in NGP visibility are nuanced and dependent upon the strategic responses of both proximal (likely accommodative) and non-proximal (likely adversarial) mainstream parties. To test this, we collect national newspapers articles published in the three months leading up to election day in 7 European countries between 1992 to 2019. We performed textual analysis to examine whether NGP visibility is affected by the visibility of mainstream parties competing on similar green issues.","University of London, Royal Holloway College",,,,,,,,"University of London, Royal Holloway College",,Aurelia Ananda,,,,,,,,Aurelia Ananda,,Comparative Politics,Media,Political Parties,Communication,,,,,Field of Greens: Issue Competition Between New Green Parties and Mainstream Parties in the News,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64960&EventID=185

0,"Competition is one of the key signifiers that describes the changes to higher education in the last decades. Reform processes and new devices such as new public management and a ubiquitous number of rankings are said to re-frame the space of higher education in a way that emphasizes competition among universities and their sub-units. But how does this competition play out, for and among whom? A closer look at higher education and across nations makes it clear that higher education institutions – while resembling each other as institutions – are very different organizations depending on national regulation, research, teaching and service orientation (cf. Stensaker et al. 2018). Competition might be diffused through “a refined semantic of scarce resources” (Werron 2009: 23; transl. AM; cf. Krücken 2017: 17) but there are barely any resources that universities and their sub-units could jointly and unequivocally compete for.
 In order to analyze universities or their sub-units as competing, it is necessary to focus on observable expressions of competition. Competition is not a goal in itself but the assumption of directed agency among comparable units. Different to market competition, organizational competition in higher education is predominantly directed at increases in public status. As public status perceptions in modern societies operate in mediation, competition is directed towards and over-values mediating devices (Werron 2009). Competition then derives from distinct speech acts, texts, visualizations and stratigraphies which assume organizations have been or will be acting towards establishing verticality among each other. As an empirical fact competition operates in and is subordinated to a stratificatory topology.
The paper aims to map out this competition-inducing stratification as a process I call field stratification and with regard to rankings in German higher education (Bloch and Mitterle 2017). It draws on seven case studies in aspirative public and private degree programs and focuses on the inclusive CHE-ranking and the exclusive FT-Ranking. Field stratification assumes higher education units (HEU) as comparable actors in a competitive social space. By performing along defined attributes, HEU obtain positions in this field. Rankings refine such imagined fields positions as ranks in a hierarchy. In a setting of multiple rankings, a ranking evokes competition in two distinct ways: it mobilizes competitive action in the field for itself (A) and among others in itself (B) as a mere status signal.
This allows for at least four forms of competitive responses by HEU. The invocation of competitive agency through rankings may cause resistance or non-recognition (1), compliance along the criteria of actions and in the organizational form as evoked by the ranking (2), recognition of a ranking as a valid but incomplete depiction of the field (3), or beggar-thy-neighbor approaches derived from inconsistencies in the evocation of agency (4). Building on examples from the case studies the paper shows that the distinct nature of competition in higher education is multi-fold building on a range of competitive field evocations that instead of answering who competes and how engage in a range of circular references that above all perpetuate the need to (re-)act competitively.",Albert-Ludwigs-Universität Freiburg,,,,,,,,Albert-Ludwigs-Universität Freiburg,,Alexander Mitterle,,,,,,,,Alexander Mitterle,,Elites,Governance,Institutions,Knowledge,Business,Education,Higher Education,Policy Change,Fielding stratification: competition and multiple ranking effects in German higher education,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65773&EventID=185
0,"Movement-party interactions have already been theorized and described, and theses on the countervailing, reinforcement or substitution relation between them have been formulated. Surprisingly, most studies of these interactions avoid to analyze the most exposed and most principle sequence of these interactions – elections and electoral activism where these interactions intensify and demonstrate themselves most clearly. Even more specifically, the aim of our paper is to explore how exactly get activist organizations engaged in electoral activism.
To study this problem, we build on a case study from Eastern Europe which has been generally characterized as showing considerable gap between civil society and institutionalized (electoral) politics. Existing data suggest that post-socialist countries continuously display higher distrust to political institutions and significant detachment between citizens/activism and institutional politics than other developed countries. This is also why the concept of transactional activism (professionalized advocacy groups forming instrumental coalitions and entering into low-key exchanges and negotiations with officials and institutions) was developed to describe post-socialist reality.
More specifically, we trace the development of Czech activist organization Million Moments for Democracy (MMD), which was established in 2018 as a reaction to the result of parliamentary elections which were won by Andrej Babiš, an agricultural tycoon. Babiš gained his political power through mobilizing discontent citizens via new political movement. It was established in 2012, gained second largest share of votes in 2013 parliamentary elections, and won the parliamentary elections in 2017. Babiš became prime minister and launched managerial-populist style of governing the country.
In our paper, we aim at understand how a transactional activism has become an electoral one. An unusual story in post-socialist settings may bring deeper understanding of the emergence of electoral activism in general. Specifically, we aim to trace, identify and describe linkage mechanisms through which MMD evolved from the small civic organization to the sponsor of the largest Czech protest mobilizations since 1989. Generally, we focus on the group formation as a transactional activist organization, on its repertoire and engagement in mobilization efforts, approaching the institutionalized actors (parties) and finally engaging in large-scale electoral activism. Particularly, we assess key aspects of MMD evolution: its framing strategies, its public protest strategies, its cooperation strategies and its intra-organizational processes in order to capture all kind of shifts in its trajectory and link these shifts back to other actors in the field and political context. Apart from “usual suspects”, we also inspect how existing post-socialist cultural environment (anti-communist discourse and politics of memory) was appropriated by MMD, and also how circumstances of COVID pandemic affected its strategies.
Our paper builds primarily on documents, public statements, videos and other formats of information produced by the MMD, semi-structured interviews with its leaders, and claim-making data (2018-2021) retrieved from public media electronic database.",University of Hradec Králové,Masaryk University,,,,,,,Masaryk University,,Milan Hrubes,Jiří Navrátil,,,,,,,Jiří Navrátil,,Civil Society,Elections,Social Movements,Mobilisation,Activism,,,,Fight fire with fire: From transactional to electoral activism in pandemic times,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65543&EventID=185
0,"It is often argued that a more flexible study programme enables students to get the most out of their learning. For instance, curriculum flexibility is often promoted as the higher education formula for students to develop soft skills and self-knowledge that are much requested on today’s job market. In addition, making students co-designers of their study programme would nurture an inclusive learning environment that caters to the various needs and interests of the heterogeneous student body.

This flexibility, however, comes with a pedagogical and an administrative price. In terms of learning, students suffer increased anxiety around choosing ‘the right’ electives in a meritocratic environment and they may not reach their full intellectual potential by avoiding academically more challenging courses. In terms of management and organisation, universities may run into staff problems because of the labour-intensive practice of designing and instructing specialised courses, and budgetary costs by hiring study counsellors and additional teaching staff to instruct all the electives. These implications make it ever more relevant to understand why universities introduce electives, specialisation courses, and free minors in study programmes.

In our paper we marry theoretical and empirical lines of inquiry in curriculum design through a quantitative comparative case study. We have coded a total of 225 undergraduate programmes in European Studies, International Relations, and Political Science affiliated with the key membership organisations UACES (University Association for Contemporary European Studies) and ECPR (European Consortium for Political Research), representing universities in Anglophone and European countries). The purpose of our analysis is to find which socio-economic circumstances as suggested by the literature correlate with curriculum flexibility as a first step in explaining this phenomenon. Therefore, the exploratory research question follows: What explains the structural curriculum flexibility across undergraduate programmes in European Studies, International Relations, and Political Science?

Our statistical analysis reveals that high-ranking universities have relatively more electives than lower ranking universities. This may be partly explained by the assumption that curriculum flexibility is a marketing tool to attract additional students. Universities with a relatively strong reputation and brand image are likely to enjoy large financial resources that enables instructing a larger number of electives. This raises questions regarding the desirability and feasibility of more flexible curricula across higher education.",Maastricht Universiteit,Maastricht Universiteit,Maastricht Universiteit,,,,,,Maastricht Universiteit,,Johan Adriaensen,Patrick Bijsmans,Talisha Schilder,,,,,,Patrick Bijsmans,,Education,Comparative Perspective,Higher Education,,,,,,"Flexibility over Stability?

0,"There is a growing literature on the way private philanthropic funding channel and govern the non-profit sector, sometimes labelled a non-profit industrial complex. What about public funding? What is its rationale and consequences? While the question of the public funding of non-profits and NGOs has often been tackled through the lenses of patronage and clientelism (Marwell, 2007), we contend that a broader perspective is necessary. Since the 1990s, a body of work has identified a certain number of logics coming with the professionalization of the non-profit sector such as the the marketization of practices and the generalization of project- and contract-based funding, or also the casualization of work through employment insertion schemes (Salamon 1993; Prouteau and Tchernonog 2015; Enjolras et al. 2018). Our research, by analyzing the totality of all non-profit subsidies granted by a local body – the city of Lille – over a 10 years period, allows to decipher the place of patronage and clientelism in the broader political economy of non-profits/institutions relationships. This research, by following the financial trajectory of all non-profits in a large French metropolis reveals the diversity of the rationale supporting public funding. 
what rationales govern the allocation, reduction or withdrawal of subsidies from the municipality or other public bodies? Are the decisions underpinned by political reasons (expression of support or criticism of public policies), managerial reasons (achievement or non-achievement of contractual objectives, satisfaction of administrative or accountancy requirements), financial reasons (poor budgetary health), etc.? How does a local authority arbitrate in order to deal with the contraction of its resources, and to the detriment of which types of associations? 
To answer these questions, this research is based on a quantitative and a qualitative study: 
- a quantitative analysis of the database of all the subsidies granted by the Town Hall to associations between 2010 and 2020 
- interviews with municipal actors (elected officials or agents) to understand the internal logic of the institution governing allocations and withdrawals, increases and decreases
- an investigation through interviews and budget monographs with associations identified as ""stable"", ""promoted"" or ""fallen"" actors in order to enter into the details of the processes that led to the continuity or changes in their funding.
In this paper, we test in particular the hypothesis of depoliticization through transparency and exemplarity insofar as all the measures and efforts produced within the municipality tend to make decisions concerning subsidies appear technical and not political. It conceals a phenomenon that could nevertheless be considered highly political, namely the increasing instrumentalization of the nonprofit sector by the local authorities and ultimately by the State.",Institut d'Études Politiques de Lille,Institut d'Études Politiques de Lille,Institut d'Études Politiques de Lille,Institut d'Études Politiques de Lille,,,,,Institut d'Études Politiques de Lille,Institut d'Études Politiques de Lille,Thomas Chevallier,Julien Talpin,Cecile Rodrigues,Anaïs Bertron,,,,,Anaïs Bertron,Cecile Rodrigues,Civil Society,Integration,Local Government,Political Sociology,Policy Implementation,State Power,,,"Follow the money.

0,"Local governments in many political systems are experimenting with new ways to involve citizens in policy-making in the hope that participatory arrangements can ‘cure the democratic malaise’ (Newton, 2012), contribute to increased levels of effectiveness of the policy-making process and ultimately lead to a greater problem-solving capacity of local government. However, the broad variety of democratic innovations applied at the local level has made it increasingly difficult for scholars and practitioners to estimate the effects and the conditions under which these occur. 
This is apparent in the extant literature aiming to take stock of these developments. Existing reviews are limited to a specific form of participatory arrangement (van der Does & Jacquet, 2020), initiator of a participatory process (Igalla, 2019) or a specific actor (Migchelbrink & Van de Walle, 2021). Scholars already analyzed the potential impact on democratic attitudes of individual participants or aspects of policy outcomes (Boulianne, 2019; Michels, 2011; Geissel & Hess, 2018).  Still, these findings could be complemented with a broader take on the effects that exceeds individual actors or specific arrangements. To help fill this gap, we conduct a more encompassing systematic literature review. By  wielding the PRISMA method we aim to find an answer to the question: What effects of local participatory arrangements are observed throughout the literature? And under what conditions did specific effects occur? To delineate the scope of our review, we focus on empirical contributions over the past decade regarding participatory arrangements where local governments act as initiators. 
Our first aim is to provide an overview of observed effects throughout the literature. We initially screen if the effects under study relate to legitimacy (e.g. more inclusive participation, increase in perceived legitimacy, increase in external political efficacy,…), democratic skills and virtues (e.g. civic skills, increased knowledge, political engagement,.…)  or effectiveness (e.g. achievement of collective goals, increased problem-solving capacity,…). All the while, remaining vigilant for additional effects.  
Secondly, we aim to gain more insight into the conditions under which certain effects occur. In our analysis we include, but do not limit ourselves to, three levels on which such conditions could be situated: 1) the arrangement itself (e.g. mode of decision-making, mode of participation, participant selection methods,…); 2) its local institutional environment (e.g. level of embeddedness, level of involvement by political actors,…) and 3) contextual conditions (e.g. policy domain or past experience in organizing  participatory processes).

0,"In the increasingly tense international atmosphere, countries’ capacity to exercise firm and clear leadership is crucial – especially concerning security and foreign policy. This poses challenges for semi-presidential regimes where executive powers are shared between presidents and governments. Since the 2004 EU enlargement, semi-presidentialism has been the most typical regime type in Europe, being especially prominent along the EU’s eastern border. Studies of semi-presidential leadership have traditionally focused on the constitutional balance of power between presidents and governments. However, studies on intra-executive conflict have shown that the level of conflict can vary significantly between countries that share rather similar constitutions. Clearly, something important is happening in the non-formal sphere of coordinative interaction that scholars have only recently begun to scrutinize more systematically. This paper contributes to this emerging project with a focused comparison of two semi-presidential countries, Finland and Romania, that share many constitutional characteristics but differ significantly in the level of intra-executive conflict. Providing a novel perspective on intra-executive decision-making, the study applies the policy network theory and rich qualitative data (official state documents, elite interviews, etc.) to examine, in-depth, the structure and operation of the policy system where presidents and governments exercise their constitutional powers. Specifically, the study seeks to uncover the largely informal (i.e., practice-related) coordination mechanisms that can foster conflict-free cooperation between agents that have incentives and capacities for independent, conflict-inducing action.",Tampere University,Tampere University,,,,,,,Tampere University,,Vesa Koskimaa,Tapio Raunio,,,,,,,Vesa Koskimaa,,Europe (Central and Eastern),Comparative Politics,Constitutions,Executives,Foreign Policy,Governance,Decision Making,,FOR THE GREATER GOOD: HOW POLICY NETWORKS ENHANCE INTRA-EXECUTIVE COORDINATION IN FOREIGN POLICY LEADERSHIP,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64375&EventID=185
0,"Paper proposal for consideration of panel 1 on ‘Voters’ Behaviour in Sub-National Politics’.


Recent election survey research has revealed significant levels of party switching between national and subnational elections. Typically, between a quarter to one third of the voters indicate that they vote for a different party in subnational elections than their nationally preferred party (Berg and Oscarsson 2020; Elklit and Kjær 2009). This has inspired a literature on explaining vote choice in subnational elections which pre-dominantly uses the second-order election model as a theoretical starting point (Gendźwiłł, Kjaer, and Steyvers 2022). According to this model, voters base their subnational vote choice on the governmental status of parties in national government. Voters who are discontent with the performance of parties in national government vote for new, small, or local parties or parties in national opposition in subnational elections. In this view, subnational elections are nothing more than ‘barometers’ or ‘referenda’ for the popularity of parties in national government. Recent research reveals that a second-order election view has limited explanatory value, to the very least, the model does not provide for a comprehensive understanding of the causes underlying the subnational vote (Lineira 2016; Kjær and Steyvers 2019). Furthermore, most research on subnational voting exploits aggregate data simply because individual-level survey data tend to be quite rare for subnational elections, especially for unitary countries. 
	This paper takes up the question under what conditions voters tend to base their vote choice on subnational issues (localized voting) rather than on national politics (second-order voting). The theoretical innovation of this paper is to develop a model of localized voting that conceptualizes the conditions under which voters tend to hold subnational politicians rather than national politicians electorally accountable. The empirical contribution of this paper is that its analysis draws on highly innovative survey questions that asked voters to evaluate the importance of a range of issues while casting their vote. In addition, another set of survey questions tapped basic vote motivations and asked respondents to indicate the extent to which they used their vote prospectively or retrospectively in relation to subnational and national government. 
These survey questions were fielded in the Norwegian Citizen Panel wave 19 which took place one month after the municipal and county elections of September 2019. The sets of innovative survey questions and the comparison between municipal and county vote choice enable the identification of the conditions under which voters are likely to cast a localized or a second-order vote in subnational elections.",Universitetet i Bergen,,,,,,,,Universitetet i Bergen,,Arjan H.

0,"During constitutional reform episodes in non-democracies, democracy activists and protesters often seek support for democracy from powerful foreign states, like the US, France or Germany. Yet, research on the promotion of democracy suggests that foreign donor states often do not wish to engage with those opposition actors that demand democracy most powerful, namely social movements of activists and popular opposition parties. Instead, it seems that they rather focus their support on professionalized and apolitical non-governmental organizations (NGOs) that may lack ‘grass-roots’ legitimacy. However, empirical quantitative data on the relations between foreign donor states, domestic democracy activists and political opposition parties is lacking in the field. 
The paper to be presented addresses this gap by presenting for the first time quantitative network data on the support and cooperation relations between foreign donor states, domestic democracy activists, and domestic opposition parties. In the paper and its presentation, I first use game theory to model the interactions between foreign donor states, the political regime, and domestic political party and civil society opposition. The model suggests that there are only narrow conditions under which foreign donor states will fully engage with democracy activists. I then investigate this conjecture in an inferential network analysis.
The data used for the analysis describes a cooperation network (N=80) between foreign donor states and domestic political opposition parties, NGOs, and social movement organizations during Togo’s constitutional reform crisis (2017-2019). It has been collected by me and a research assistant using respondent-based snowball sampling in 39 interviews during field research in Togo in 2019. The data is used to specify an Exponential Random Graph Model (ERGM) that tests the probability for support, cooperation, and alliance links between the different types of actors present in the network. The analysis is currently ongoing but is scheduled to be finalised by July. 
The first preliminary results indicate that (i) intergovernmental donors like the European Union and transnational non-governmental organizations like Amnesty International engaged much more with domestic social movements and civil society than traditional bilateral foreign donor states; (ii) bilateral foreign donor states mainly engaged with well-established political opposition parties; (iii) political opposition parties formed a dense community within the larger network, connected to the other domestic nodes of the network only through a few civil society organisations that acted as hubs and bridges. 
The findings may bear important implications for supporting and protecting democracy during reform episodes. First, the findings suggest that bilateral donors indeed do not engage with local civil society that enjoys ‘grass-roots’ legitimacy sufficiently. Second, the ultimate findings may underline the need to protect the civic space in authoritarian countries. So far, the data show that a few civil society organisations act as hubs and bridges. Authoritarian regimes are able to easily target these central actors through extra-legal or legal means. Foreign donor states, intergovernmental organizations and transnational NGOs need to call out such ‘shrinking of the civic space’ and, where possible, sanction it.",German Institute of Development and Sustainability (IDOS),,,,,,,,German Institute of Development and Sustainability (IDOS),,Daniel Nowack,,,,,,,,Daniel Nowack,,Democratisation,International Relations,Social Movements,NGOs,Political Activism,Political Regime,Protests,,"Foreign Donors, Domestic Activists: Inferential Network Analysis of Democracy Promotion During Togo’s Constitutional Reform Crisis (2017-2019)",https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65394&EventID=185
0,"Separatist leaders in Abkhazia, South Ossetia, and Transnistria - breakaway enclaves in Georgia and Moldova, respectively – openly declare that their ultimate goal is the establishment of a separate state. This study questions whether public statements and official positions are indicative of separatists’ true preferences. Instead, it suggests that in order to capture separatists’ revealed preferences regarding the status of their territory, one can look at the dynamics surrounding the establishment of foreign policy bureaucracies in these enclaves. Specifically, the paper argues that the establishment of complex foreign affairs institutions captures separatists’ revealed preferences. Given the high costs of setting up and operating a complex architecture of foreign affairs in the context of international nonrecognition (or limited recognition), the presence of sophisticated foreign policy bureaucracy (marked by the presence of an office/ministry of foreign relations/external affairs staffed by professional bureaucrats) signals long-term commitment to separate rule. The analysis of the foreign policy bureaucracy in Abkhazia, South Ossetia, and Transnistria reveals great variation in separatists’ preferences: fairly large and professionalised foreign policy bureaucracies in Abkhazia and Transnistria suggest a preference for independence or continued de facto separation; by contrast, a rudimentary foreign policy apparatus in South Ossetia (under conditions of similar available resources) indicates a preference for a status other than independence.",University of Glasgow,,,,,,,,University of Glasgow,,Adrian Florea,,,,,,,,Adrian Florea,,Conflict,Ethnic Conflict,Security,,,,,,"Foreign policy bureaucracies and separatists’ revealed preferences: A look at Abkhazia, South Ossetia, and Transnistria",https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=62263&EventID=185

This changing energy system in the EU’s multi-level governance structure can be described as polycentric. With the Clean Energy Package, the EU has introduced “energy communities” in order to offset its carbon footprint and involve citizens in the energy sector. Energy communities form part of what we call here “bottom-up energy models”. They have been existing in several EU member states in various forms and in different numbers even before the Clean Energy Package.
There are many studies investigating single or small samples of countries and identifying factors that have had major incluence on the form and size of bottom-up energy models in that respective countries. Studies that compare larger sets of countries are seldom. We present results from a metaanalysis of literature on bottom-up energy models in EU-27 countries (and beyond). We use a refined version of Ostrom et al.’s Socio-Ecological (and Technical) System Framework and insights from historical institutionalism to define relevant variables and the coding scheme. As a result, we identify to what extent and how (changing) national policies have influenced and are influencing this type of local action in the EU’s polycentric energy system.",Leuphana Universität Lüneburg,Leuphana Universität Lüneburg,,,,,,,Leuphana Universität Lüneburg,,,najamul memon,,,,,,,najamul memon,,European Union,Institutions,Policy Analysis,Climate Change,Energy,Energy Policy,,,Formation and Development of Bottom-Up Energy Models in the Polycentric Electricity System of the EU-27,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63510&EventID=185
0,"Existing research has shown that there is considerable diversity when it comes to populist radical right party (PRRP) organization (Heinisch & Mazzoleni, 2016), but it is less clear why this is the case. In other words, why do some PRRP opt for organizational models that resemble the traditional mass party model, while others choose a more personalistic approach? The Netherlands provides an ideal laboratory environment to examine this question. Once known for its progressivism and social tolerance, the Netherlands long seemed “immune” to the far right. However, since the turn of the twenty-first century, the country has witnessed the rise of several successful PRRPs, including the Lijst Pim Fortuyn (List Pim Fortuyn or LPF), the Partij voor de Vrijheid (Party for Freedom or PVV) and, more recently, the Forum voor Democratie (Forum for Democracy or FvD). Despite obvious ideological similarities between these parties, there are noteworthy differences in terms of party organization. This paper seeks to highlight and explain specific decisions in party organization made by the LPF, the PVV and the FvD. By drawing on a range of different primary and secondary sources including party documents, media reports and existing scholarly sources, we argue that the organizational model of the FvD is a synthesis of its two predecessors, notably the LPF and the PVV. To avoid internal dissension that brought about the demise of the LPF, the FvD opted for a deeply hierarchical party model with authoritarian features, thereby adopting organizational elements of Wilders’s “personal party”. At the same time, the FvD drew lessons from the financial limitations of the PVV by creating a large membership base, which enabled the party to tap into considerable funding opportunities. The findings show evidence of institutional learning, thereby shedding light on the electoral persistence of PRRPs, notably their ability to withstand setbacks and adapt to new circumstances.",Rijksuniversiteit Groningen,Rijksuniversiteit Groningen,,,,,,,Rijksuniversiteit Groningen,,Léonie de Jonge,Gerrit Voerman,,,,,,,Léonie de Jonge,,Democracy,Extremism,Political Parties,Populism,,,,,Fortuyn versus Wilders versus Baudet: The Evolution of Populist Radical Right Party Organization in the Netherlands,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63837&EventID=185
0,The paper draws of the variety of recent experiences of populism across the world to develop a typology of populist strategies for dealing with being successfully elected to government. The paper argues that anti-establishment element of populism does provide a particular challenge for populists in office regarding how they maintain their populist credentials while becoming part of the establishment that they have opposed. Looking at the range of cases we can identify three patterns of behaviour in office. The first consists of those populists who once in office effectively moderate or abandon their populism. The second strategy is where populists in office attempt to fundamentally reshape the institutions of government into a form that minimises opposition and maximises the legitimacy of their claims to bring about change. The final strategy is where populists in office behave as if they are in opposition and effectively continue to govern in a campaigning mode and eschew the aspiration to bring about policy change. The paper attempts to outline these strategies and to illustrate them with recent cases of populists in power.,University of Sussex,,,,,,,,University of Sussex,,Paul Taggart,,,,,,,,Paul Taggart,,Government,Populism,Power,,,,,,Foxes in the Chicken Coop?

0,"Youth activism for the climate has attracted increasing attention in recent years. The emergence
of Fridays For Future and Extinction Rebellion between 2018 and 2019 has brought to the fore a
new generation of activists and provided the issue of climate change with unprecedented saliency
and visibility in the public sphere. Nevertheless, student climate strikes are far from being the first
occurrence of mass mobilisation on climate change. Rather, they are contributing in a long
trajectory of climate justice mobilisation, rooted in different strands of environmentalism, as well
as in the climatisation of global justice struggles. Research on social movements have analysed
different stages of this developments, as well as assessing the breaks and continuities in this
pathway. Still, there is no systematic comparison between student climate strikes and
“traditional” climate justice marches.
Our paper aims to fill this gap in the literature, focusing on the framing of climate change in the
protest activities that took place in Milan, Italy, in October 2021, during the Youth Pre-COP 26 of
the UNFCCC: a student climate strike was organised by FFF, a “traditional” climate justice march by
a wide coalition of actors, and both a climate camp and an eco-social forum acted as
countersummits. The paper, relying on protest surveys and qualitative interviews, discusses the
differences, similarities and spaces for convergence between activists in these different forums,
focusing on the framing of climate change, and in particular on the different meanings attached to
the “climate justice” concept. The survey data shows that, even if “system change” was the vastly
predominant prognostic frame in both demonstrations, it was much more so in the “traditional”
climate justice march than in the student climate strike. We investigate these analogies and
differences through the analysis of qualitative interviews.",Università degli Studi di Trento,Università degli Studi di Trento,Scuola Normale Superiore,Università degli Studi di Trento,Scuola Normale Superiore,,,,Università degli Studi di Trento,,Niccolò Bertuzzi,Louisa Parks,Lorenzo Zamponi,Jessica Cuel,Giuseppe Alberto Cugnata,,,,Louisa Parks,,Contentious Politics,Social Justice,Social Movements,Climate Change,Political Activism,Protests,Activism,Youth,Framing climate justice at the youth pre-COP,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64950&EventID=185

At the same time, we often see portrayals of disabled people being inspirational, courageous, and heroic. This means that disabled candidates who stand for election are likely to think carefully about how to frame their impairment in order to gain – or at least not jeopardize – electoral support: ignore it; downplay its relevance; or frame it as a positive attribute that has provided them with valuable experiences, skills, or personality traits. This study uses data from original online survey experiments in two countries to examine how voters react to disabled candidates’ self-portrayals.

0,"The Greta Thunberg-inspired Fridays for Future (FfF) movement spread throughout the world during 2019, with millions of young people getting involved in school strikes and protests to raise awareness of climate change. Although much of this activity was put on hold during the COVID-19 pandemic, the movement contributed towards hundreds of regional and local governments declaring a ‘climate emergency’ in 2019 and 2020, particularly in Germany and Italy (Ruiz-Campillo et al 2021).
Given the conditions in which they arose, there is a risk that such declarations may be largely performative or symbolic and not result in substantive policy change (Newig 2007). However, drawing on municipal policy documents and interviews with FfF activists, government officials and elected representatives in fifteen German municipalities, we show how the movement has become highly integrated into decision-making in various cities and is having a significant impact on policy. Pressure from FFF has led to municipalities adopting more stringent greenhouse gas reduction targets, employing more staff to try and achieve these targets, and – even in places that have not declared a climate emergency – the development of more ambitious sustainability and climate strategies.",Åbo Akademi,,,,,,,,Nottingham Trent University,,Kristine Kern,,,,,,,,Peter Eckersley,,Local Government,Climate Change,Youth,,,,,,Fridays for Future and climate policymaking in German cities,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65479&EventID=185

Single-party governments are the exception. In most cases, mainstream parties invite populists as minor partners despite their anti-elitist platform, such as in Austria, Finland or the Netherlands. In other constellations, populists represent the larger coalition partner (Poland). Still other governments, such as in Greece or Italy, were formed exclusively by populist parties. Many cases indicate that governing with populists is less stable. In the Netherlands, Austria and Italy ended prematurely - sometimes due to scandals (Austria), often due to disagreement over policy (Italy).

Studies have instead implicitly adopted a conception of process preferences as ideological models. This article develops a new, multidimensional approach to understanding the nature of a process preference. It uses this approach to question the implicit assumption of the ideological conception that process preferences are by definition highly abstract, purely normative and ideological coherent, developing an alternative, contingent conception of a process preference based around three concepts of contextuality, conditionality and ambivalence. This multidimensional approach opens up the possibility of ontologically different kinds of process preferences, providing a comprehensive framework for integrating recent more piecemeal challenges to the ideological conception. The elaboration of the concepts of contextuality, conditionality and ambivalence offer a range of new departure points for future research, as well as a more fine-grained understanding of process preferences that could improve the predictive power and policy relevance of research findings.",Johann Wolfgang Goethe-Universität Frankfurt,,,,,,,,Johann Wolfgang Goethe-Universität Frankfurt,,Rikki Dean,,,,,,,,Rikki Dean,,Comparative Politics,Democracy,Political Psychology,Public Opinion,,,,,From an Ideological to a Contingent Conceptualisation of Political Process Preferences: A Multidimensional Approach,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64727&EventID=185
0,"As a philosopher and writer, Albert Camus left behind a rich body of work relevant to political theory. While one can derive a theory of Democracy as rebellion (see Pausch 2019) from his explicitly political essays, some of his literary works negotiate central questions of power and society. In his play Caligula, he describes the consequences of absolute freedom, and in his novel The Plague he focuses on the ambivalence of the individual between the pursuit of happiness and solidarity. Based on the two works, the paper presented here develops a model of cosmopolitan solidarity among strangers that dispenses with communitarian moments of identity.

0,"The meaning of left-right ideology has been changing in European democracies. While traditionally the left-right conflict has been understood in economic terms, pitting free market right against interventionist left, scholars have suggested that the terms left and right have taken a more cultural meaning in recent years relating to national identity and immigration concerns with cosmopolitan left standing against nationalist right. While this change has been debated by both political scientist and pundits, we lack a theory of why this change has occurred.
We propose two different explanations: a bottom-up and a top-down perspective. The first proposes that voters respond to situations on the ground and alter their views according to those. In countries that see more unemployment the economic interpretation of the left-right should still be strong, while in countries that see more immigration, the cultural interpretation of the left-right should matter more. The second proposes that voters respond to elite cues. In countries where the elite conflict is economic in nature, voters will also see the dominant political conflict in economic terms. Where the elite conflict is cultural in nature, these voters will understand the dominant political conflict in cultural terms.

Climate change mitigation efforts to tackle the problem of deforestation in tropical forest rich countries (REDD+) are no exception. National REDD+ policy arenas are characterized by complex, multi-actor, multi-sector and multi-level interactions, which go from cooperation to contention. We use a comparative policy network approach to investigate power structures in REDD+ policy domains over time. Based on a theoretical framework developed by Kriesi et al. 2006 we assess dynamics in power structures based on two dimensions: distribution of power and dominant type of interaction, which can span from cooperation to contention. These structures are then assessed along levels of progress in REDD+ policy processes. The study tests a number of hypotheses related to the role of ownership in policy process, the role of internal coalition dynamics, the role of dominant type of interaction between coalitions, and the role of broader political dynamics external to the REDD+ policy domain to assess drivers of progress in REDD+ policy, and in particular the role that cooperation, contentions and coalitions work play in forest-based climate change mitigation.

0,"In Europe, three conceptions of democracy – majoritarian, liberal and social – compete to define how we should understand, assess and address democratic backsliding. Rarely articulated explicitly yet entirely consequential, these conceptions offer divergent – indeed oppositional – answers to all the pertinent dimensions of the issue, theoretical as well as practical: what democracy requires, what forms of power it rejects; whence it draws its normative political value; and what fundamental human danger it seeks to avert. This paper will offer a rational reconstruction of these three positions, their philosophical roots and outlook, their shortcomings and promise, seeking in the first instance to contribute to the conceptual clarity of a discourse that too often relies on definitional slogans like “popular sovereignty”, “free and fair elections” or “a community of free and equals”. The paper will then draw three key implications. First, considering the question of democratic resilience, it will reframe the debate on whether an illiberal democracy can remain democratic by situating the two sides squarely within the first two conceptions (majoritarian and liberal) and positing a social third, to critically examine the conditions under which even a liberal democracy can remain democratic. Second, it will revisit the question of the democratic deficit of the EU in order to deepen our understanding of why EU institutions have been unable effectively to handle the autocratic (anti-democratic on all three accounts) regimes in Hungary and Poland. Third, it will argue that a real counterforce to autocratic populism calls for a robust social conception of democracy which goes beyond the first two, specifically by shifting the ideal paradigm from a democratically-elected government that rests on legitimate authority, to a democratic society that aspires to justice.",Barenboim-Said Akademie,,,,,,,,Barenboim-Said Akademie,,Roni Mann,,,,,,,,Roni Mann,,Democracy,European Union,Political Theory,Populism,Social Justice,Liberalism,Normative Theory,,From Democratic Deficit to Democratic Backsliding: What Conception of Democracy for Europe?,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65191&EventID=185
0,"Conventional wisdom assumes that DI widens over time in a path-dependent fashion. Member states opting-out once are more likely to opt-out again when similar or related policy issues come up for EU decision making. The standard example is EMU which started with differentiation and entrenched differentiation in specific institutional arrangements such as, most importantly, the Eurogroup. The Eurozone crisis added nuance to this picture by mixing differentiated and uniform crisis responses. While the brunt of the crisis response was born by DI instruments including the Greek loan facility, the EFSF and the ESM, there were also uniform responses involving non-Eurozone member states such as the EFSM. The Covid crisis raised many of the issues that had also been salient during the Eurozone crisis, but the policy response was the opposite: the differentiated ESM went practically unused, while the uniform NGEU, modelled on the EFSM, took center-stage. If there was path-dependency at all, it seemed to work in favour of uniformity rather than differentiation. Why did the two institutional trajectories move in opposite directions? By means of an “explaining-outcome” process tracing design, we analyse the marginalisation of the ESM and the rise of uniform fiscal burden sharing from the EFSM to NGEU. By so doing, we uncover the causal mechanisms behind the reinforcement of either differentiation or uniformity.",Hertie School,European University Institute,,,,,,,European University Institute,,Marta Migliorati,Philipp Genschel,,,,,,,Philipp Genschel,,European Union,Integration,Differentiation,Eurozone,,,,,From Differentiation to uniformity?

0,"From the first months of the Covid19 pandemic onward, a group of key actors in the growing public sector innovation (PSI) discourse declared the crisis an opportunity-in-waiting, arguing that the pandemic has exacerbated underlying problems of democracy. PSI advocates from leading global innovation consultancies regularly seize upon critiques of inadequate digital infrastructure, slow crisis management, and democratic deficits or backsliding to promote creative, deliberative, and participatory mechanisms for dealing with public problems. Public administration, they contend, has to be reformed such that silo-thinking is minimized, opportunities for cross-ministerial collaboration enhanced, and most importantly, new connections between citizens and public administration established. According to PSI advocates, democratic deficits are rooted in government’s inability to understand, manage, and remediate social challenges or solve technically and socially complex problems in demographically mixed, value-pluralist communities. At the core of the debate is an explicit critique of earlier innovations like New Public Management (NPM) and program budgeting whose overly rationalistic focus on outcome-based performance measurement and evidence-based policy making builds on technocratic epistemologies that fail to generate the right kinds of knowledge for dealing with complexity. 
Among proposals for greater government digitization, innovations to procurement procedures, or improvement of evidence evaluation is also, perhaps surprisingly, participatory or human-centered design. Building in part on traditions of policy design and deliberative planning but also on private sector practices like industrial design, architecture, and information design, this peculiar design practice places a premium on collective knowledge generation in which both technical expertise and lived experience have to be accommodated. It is this collective and creative approach that today proffers democratic alternatives to technocratic policy or public management conventions. 
This paper seeks to make sense of the current phenomenon of design in government genealogically, by situating it in a prior moment of administrative innovation: Third Way politics. Tracing contemporary PSI debates and consultancies to one site of origin in the UK, I show that New Labour’s rethinking of social democracy not only prefigured but set the stage for public sector design ideas and practices today on an institutional as well as methodological level. Often billed as the maturation of neoliberalism, the 1980s and 90s in the UK witnessed ongoing arguments over what it means for government to serve the people and how the success or failure to do so should be measured. But rather than repeating established analyses about the neoliberalization of the state––like the responsibilization of citizens through the marketization of public services or workfare programs and holding civil servants accountable through benchmarking or auditing––I argue that New Labour can also be read as a moment of experimentation with new democratic forms in the face of historical transformations. Against this background, then, today’s PSI and especially public sector participatory design–with its creative experimental approach–can be read as an attempt to recast public bureaucracy as an integral part of contemporary democracy rather than as a necessary technocratic exception to otherwise democratic processes. For better or worse, therefore, design is one mechanism through which technical democracy is enacted today.",Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin,,,,,,,,Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin,,Anke Gruendel,,,,,,,,Anke Gruendel,,Democracy,Political Participation,Public Administration,,,,,,From Evidence to Prototyping: Political Epistemology beyond the Democracy-Technocracy Dualism,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63956&EventID=185
0,"Despite not having clear scientific evidence of their effectiveness, several countries developed Digital Contact Tracing (DCT) apps throughout 2020 to slow down the spread of COVID-19. European institutions decided to encourage a common decentralized approach that could foster interoperability between the national apps. This work investigates to what degree did evidence about the effectiveness of the COVID-19 apps played a role in the policy framing of DCT at the European level. In this paper, we investigated the policy framing process on DCT, through a dataset of 93 official documents that contributed to the policy framing of such technologies. We employed a dictionary-based and co-occurrence automated text analysis to understand to what degree a discourse on the evidence of apps’ effectiveness was present, and we compared it with other discourses that played an important role in the framing process. We found that two distinct – but deeply intertwined – discourses focused on guarantees in terms of human rights and on technical aspects of the COVID-19 apps widely prevailed over the issue of effectiveness. We also found that the two prevailing discourses were deeply intertwined in the framing of DCT. Based on our empirical results, we argue that the “techno-guarantees” discourse was decisive in the policy framing of DCT at the European level. Therefore, the policy framing of DCT should be considered more techno-guarantees-based than evidence-based. We conclude by addressing the necessity of further research to understand if the techno-guarantees discourse is present in the policy framing process when emerging technologies are at the core of the policy response.",Università di Bologna,Università di Bologna,,,,,,,Università di Bologna,,Paride Carrara,Michele Veneziano,,,,,,,Michele Veneziano,,Knowledge,Technology,Policy-Making,,,,,,From evidence-based to techno-guarantees-based policy: The European framing of digital contact tracing apps,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65290&EventID=185

However, empirical research raises many doubts about the quotas’ effectiveness (e.g. Millard, & Con, 2013; Górecki, & Kukołowicz, 2014; Jankowski, & Marcinkiewicz, 2019). To study this phenomenon, we use a model that divides candidates in open-list proportional state-level elections into five distinct categories according to their political career development: incumbents, local politicians trying to win a seat in the state-level elections, former office holders, repeatedly retrying losers, and novices. Applying such a model helps to understand what role is played by the candidates’ gender and the legal obligation of applying gender quotas to the lists. Each category of candidates is different when it comes to the multi-stage game of an open-list proportional representation system – from previously accumulated political capital, through preselection of candidates and political party hierarchy reflected by the place on the list, to the fight for votes and finally, winning a seat.

0,"Democratic innovations are increasingly popular across the world as mechanisms for governments to explore new ways to engage the public. Numerous efforts are in place to collect and assess large numbers of individual cases (Participedia, LATINNO) and organize these often disparate experiences according to their institutional designs (Estub and Escobar 2019). Yet, these efforts have largely focused on the government-led design and institutionalization of participatory practices and its impact on representative democracy. With few exceptions (Zaremberg, 2012; Curato, 2019), little attention has been paid to the entanglements between government-led, internationally-led, and community-led forms of deliberative and participatory governance. In this paper, we argue that democratic innovations ought to be understood not in silos but within ecosystems of engagement.

We use grounded theory, drawing evidence from the Healthier Democracies project to develop an empirically-informed conceptual framework that better captures the coexistence, evolution, and adaptation of institutions and processes of participation. We suggest that an ecological lens can help us understand not only the impact of a specific State-led democratic system of engagement, but the relationships between multiple participatory practices; governance structures; as well as communities and actors living in distinct natural, political, and historical conditions. In other words, it would allow us to see participatory and deliberative democracy as an ecosystem of collective governance, rather than a series of decision-making processes within the government system.

We test the concept’s ability to reflect how digital innovations are inscribed in pre-existing frameworks for in-person engagement (Madrid), how institutionalized instances of participation function in parallel to community-driven, radical spaces of participation (Bologna), and how highly decentralized, small-scale participatory spaces allow for targeted local action (Berlin). These ecosystems comprise interrelated mechanisms such as law and policies, staffing, budgets, programs, increased cultures of participation, and different forms of citizens’ self-organization embedded in government systems. The concept sheds a different light on the multifaceted, complex, and interdependent nature of participatory and deliberative institutions and processes.
The concept of ecosystems can better account for instances of participation that do not match normative assumptions and challenging standards for institutional design, but that still allows for community empowerment and impactful decision-making.",Institute for Advanced Sustainability Studies (IASS),Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin,,,,,,,Institute for Advanced Sustainability Studies (IASS),,Azucena Moran,Melisa Ross,,,,,,,Azucena Moran,,Democracy,Governance,Local Government,,,,,,From government-led systems to ecosystems of collective governance,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63612&EventID=185

Our findings show a strong aversion towards nuclear use, with an overwhelming majority preferring to risk a military defeat than to agree with a demonstrative nuclear explosion or a strike against a NATO base. An escalation of a conflict involving NATO missile strikes on Russian territory had statistically insignificant effect on the approval of nuclear use.

0,"The growing importance of digital technologies has sparked a lively debate on whether – and, if so, with what consequences – the Internet is altering political actors’ internal organization, their communication strategies, and practices. Previous research has shown that political actors in many established democracies are increasingly shifting their electoral campaign efforts to the digital sphere. Direct democratic campaigns – apart from singular events such as the 2016 Brexit referendum – have not been adequately considered so far. This paper explores the extent to which political elites in Swiss direct democratic campaigns have transformed their communication practices over time and argues that the relevance of digital technologies in relation to traditional communication channels has increased significantly. This expectation is tested on a large database of newspaper ads published before all direct democratic votes held in Switzerland between 1981 and 2020 and Facebook data from 2007 to 2020. Negative binomial regression and time series analyses reveal that the campaign logic in Swiss direct democratic campaigns is undergoing considerable changes. As one of the first, this paper empirically proves the changing dynamics in Swiss direct democratic campaigns. This has important implications for future research on political campaigning in Switzerland and beyond which will also be discussed in this paper.",University of Zurich,,,,,,,,University of Zurich,,Michaela Fischer,,,,,,,,Michaela Fischer,,Political Parties,Referendums and Initiatives,Campaign,Internet,Social Media,Communication,,,From newspapers to social media?

0,"Over the last decades, democracy in the Czech Republic transformed. On the one hand, disenchantment with representative democracy, specifically with the established parties and party politics, increased significantly. On the other hand, demand for more participation, especially at the local level, grew. Here, the cure to the ills of representative democracy is more participatory democracy. This includes civil society, but more importantly, demands for more inclusion in decisions directly affecting their lives and communities. As a result, various types of democratic innovation are emerging and gaining importance.
The paper focuses on participatory budgeting in the Czech Republic. Compared to the world, this is a relatively new phenomenon in Czechia and the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, which has not yet been sufficiently explored.
The paper offers a first systematic analysis of participatory budgeting in Czechia alongside three criteria: inclusiveness, transparency, and mobilisation potential. These criteria are essential. If citizens cannot debate and change the rules, if there is no plural inclusion of citizenry, or if decision-making procedures are not transparent, then participatory budgeting may conceal a new form of domination that has nothing to do with a process of democratisation (Ganuza and Baiocchi 2019).

0,"In recent years, scholars have asked to what degree, and how, the growing electoral strength of the radical right is associated with far-right mobilization outside of institutional politics, for example in the form of racist and anti-immigration violence or grassroots protest politics. Overall, it has become increasingly clear that the line between far-right grassroots activism and party politics is fading, and that the former play an important role in mobilizing popular support for far-right parties and policies. 

This article explores the evolution of far-right protest mobilization from 2008 to 2020 in Spain and Germany, two large European democracies that saw the sudden electoral breakthrough of a far-right party in national politics (VOX in 2019, and Alternative für Deutschland in 2013, resp.). Due to their activity in the electoral and protest arena, both VOX and AfD present could hence be conceptualized as hybrid ‘movement-parties’. Consequently, they are expected to affect the dynamic between far-right politics and grassroots mobilization in both contexts, and present relevant cases to study the blurring of boundaries between the far-right party politics and mobilization in the streets. 

This article will answer the following three research questions. First, building on political opportunity structure theory, it asks whether the emergence of a prominent far-right actor in the national political sphere of Spain and Germany is associated with increased mobilization of far-right grassroots mobilization (the so-called congruence thesis) or whether the presence of a prominent far-right party in fact leads to a decrease of far-right mobilization outside of institutional politics (the counterweight thesis). Second, it will quantitatively and qualitatively explore the dynamics of far-right street mobilization, hereby asking if and how the breakthrough of a prominent far-right party coincides with changes in far-right protest tactics (e.g. more or less violent forms of protest), protest actors, countermobilization, police intervention, and issues mobilized by far-right protest actors. Finally, it asks to what degree the evidence presented does indeed point towards a blurring of the boundaries between far-right electoral politics and grassroots activism, by exploring the ways in which far-right parties and movements coordinate mobilization activities in Germany and Spain. 

This article will answer the main research questions by using the first data outputs of the Comparative Far-right Protest (CFP) project. The dataset used in the article is comprised of 1688 protest events of Spanish and German far right actors between 2008 and 2020. Data has been collected by means of protest event analysis (PEA), a form of quantitative content analysis that details key features of specific protests and allows for the systematic comparison of protest across time and place. The data collection was based on a semi-automated process and actor-centred approach, from the Spanish broadsheet newspaper El Pais and the German broadsheet Tageszeitung.",University of Oslo,Université Libre de Bruxelles,Universitetet i Oslo,,,,,,University of Oslo,,Iris Beau Segers,Pietro Castelli Gattinara,Anders Ravik Jupskås,,,,,,Iris Beau Segers,,Comparative Politics,Contentious Politics,Political Violence,Social Movements,Mobilisation,Party Systems,Protests,,From picket to parliament – The blurring boundaries between far-right party politics and grassroots mobilization in Germany and Spain,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65082&EventID=185
0,"The borderline between those actions that are non-liberal or still compatible with the internal market law of the European Union seems to be more and more relative nowadays. Recent challenges like the global financial and economic crisis of 2008 or the coronavirus crisis may even strengthen this ambivalence. In spite of expectations of a deeper integration in the Union, a contradictory tendency may arise concerning competitive advantages that are not classified as measures being incompatible with EU law. In the European legislation, we can see a trend for almost two decades that Member States’ governments get more influence in those economic sectors which are subject to regulation at the EU level, and consequently, their discretion has been increasing in specification of compatible conditions. A similar process or at least a step towards the above direction can be seen in each regulatory sector, even if in different degree and intensity. Such a trend may lead to weakening of the integration as a whole, especially as an effect of nationalist powers showing scepticism towards a stronger Europe.
Our analysis mainly focuses on changes of European Union rules, in particular on the exemptions which apply to specific public services sectors in the field of energy (electricity and gas), post and telecommunication, waste, water and wastewater. In our view, these changes in the regulatory background have an influential effect on the wider context of competition extending well beyond the scope of the above-mentioned areas including ordinary services of economic interests.  
As a part of our research, we leveraged an original database containing selected cases completed by the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) between 2000 and 2020. The role of the case-law of the CJEU is assumed to be of particular importance in supporting this line of development. Our paper states that there is a correlation between the extension of derogations from EU internal market and competition rules allowed for Member States, and the tendency of widening discretion in the jurisdiction of the CJEU. In order to prove this statement, our study combines the analytical research with a legal empirical method, specifically a statistical analysis of the case law of the CJEU. The sample selection was focused on decisions where the sector involved or the contested national instruments where relevant from the point of view of our research focus. The cases have been classified according to the form of competitive advantages triggered by the national measures being the subject to the CJEU procedures, as well as according to their outcome. Based on the analysis of the respective categories, we may conclude that the CJEU, within the scope of its discretionary power represent a relatively extensive approach which is rather receptive than rejecting towards Member States’ derogatory instruments.

Based on the comparison of three sites of facilitated transnational peer learning in the field of quality assurance, discursive and material enablers for reflexive and epistemic learning are reconstructed along the analytical dimensions of problematisation, role framing and the internal ambiguities of knowledge production and utilisation. On the one hand, transnational peer learning practices contribute to the social and political certification of universities and their organisations as epistemic actors.  At the same time, reflective practice (self-reflection, self-analysis and self-assessment) emerges as a pragmatic logic of peer learning across the three cases, which implies a unique combination of organisational capacity-building and political agency-building.

0,"Observers frequently point to the rise of ‘professional politicians’ as a source of distrust with political elites. This attitude is rooted, in part, in a longstanding public reticence about a salaried political class. However, few studies have provided systematic evidence of how politicians themselves negotiated this process. To explore how the self-presentation of the political class in a key democracy shifted over time to facilitate the emergence of full-time, professionally remunerated legislators, a thematic content analysis (TCA) was conducted of the 23 major debates on legislators’ salaries in the United Kingdom House of Commons between 1911 and 2011. Using a previously developed coding scheme, the analysis identified 1360 individual statements covering seven major themes and 22 arguments. Results show that while payment was originally framed as an allowance to facilitate democratic representation, over time rhetoric used by politicians in relation to their own pay became increasingly meritocratic, emphasising the recruitment of highly qualified people as legislators. Qualitative insights from these debates also throw light on how and why the language which the British political class used to describe its role changed over time.",University of Oxford,,,,,,,,University of Oxford,,Nicholas Dickinson,,,,,,,,Nicholas Dickinson,,Elites,Institutions,Parliaments,Political Leadership,Qualitative,,,,"From Representation to Meritocracy: Understanding Professionalisation of the Political Class Through UK Parliamentary Pay Debates, 1911-2011",https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63484&EventID=185
0,"The field of transitional justice (TJ), as a sub-field of peace research and IR, has highlighted the circulation of actors between different spheres of (knowledge) activities – namely research, practice and policymaking – as both one of its strengths and its weaknesses. It is seen as either a contribution to bring research and practice closer together, producing benefits for both, or as blurring the line between these presumably differentiable practices. This paper starts by outlining some of the assumptions that are being made about the research-policy-practice nexus in TJ before mapping out the multiple ways in which these separations are blurred. Drawing on practice and assemblage theories in IR and unpacking the constructed nature of concepts and labels such “research” and “practice”, “academic” and “practitioner” the paper makes a critical contribution to understanding not only what knowledge is produced, but also why some knowledges and knowledge producers are able to exert greater influence than others. The paper uses the African Union TJ policy process as an empirical example and links this to broader debates in the TJ and IR scholarships. Basing a study of knowledge production in peace research and IR on this particular case allows additional insights on the role of external and internal knowledge in a given context, and the questions of legitimacy associated with that. 
The paper thus makes three key contributions: 1) an assessment of the research-practice nexus in TJ, 2) an analysis of the labels being employed to describe (and legitimize) certain knowledge-related actors and activities that brings practice theories into conversation with TJ, and 3) an understanding of internal-external knowledge dynamics in a particular policy process that is embedded in the historical and political situatedness of the AU and the issue of TJ.",University of Basel,,,,,,,,University of Basel,,Ulrike Lühe,,,,,,,,Ulrike Lühe,,Africa,Civil Society,Knowledge,Transitional justice,,,,,From research to practice?

0,"Digital activism had been an important dimension of protest and mobilisation already before the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, however, it became a crucial tool for social movement organizations around the globe when national governments imposed stay-at-home measures in early 2020, which often included a ban on mass gatherings in public. Based on a case study of the German populist far-right protest movement PEGIDA, this article makes a proposal of how to study such virtual forms of protest. Drawing from interpretive approaches in anthropology and social movement studies as well as literature on digital activism, it explores the processes of ritualization in virtual protest events. Conceptually, the analysis demonstrates that virtual protest rituals may have group-integrative functions similar to ritualized street demonstrations, and thus offer an opportunity for the constitution of protest groups as such. Methodologically, the analysis reveals the strengths of ethnographies of protest: Adopting the lens of “patchwork ethnography”, this flexible approach allows for innovative insights in times when other methods yield zero data. This article is based on an extended ethnographic experience within PEGIDA’s populist far-right protest events in 2019-21, including both “physical” and “virtual” fieldwork.",Jagiellonian University,,,,,,,,Jagiellonian University,,Sabine Dorothea Volk,,,,,,,,Sabine Dorothea Volk,,Europe (Central and Eastern),Contentious Politics,Populism,Social Movements,Constructivism,Social Media,Protests,Activism,From Ritualized Demonstrations to Virtual Marches: A “Patchwork Ethnography” of Populist Far-right Protest in Pandemic Times,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64762&EventID=185
0,"Previous studies of European Union (EU) discourses related to climate change detected a significant degree of securitization. This paper argues that scholars must more carefully disentangle issue areas to get a full and accurate account of what securitization processes might be underway – and why. In this paper, by distinguishing climate change policies between those associated with climate change mitigation and those related to climate change adaptation, we show that the latter are subject to a different set of discursive influences, including close association with the United Nations (UN), and a different set of policy demands, including local-level implementation. Our analysis shows that these discursive influences and policy dynamics help explain why the EU politics surrounding climate change adaptation shows less signs of securitization, and more signs of riskification – or even desecuritization – instead. Evidence from textual analysis and participant interviews, drawn from both the EU and UN venues, provide the material for the analysis, and allow us to pinpoint drivers of less securitized climate change politics in some cases.",University of Stavanger,Stockholm University,,,,,,,University of Stavanger,,Claudia Morsut,Mark Rhinard,,,,,,,Claudia Morsut,,European Union,Governance,Climate Change,,,,,,From Securitization to Desecuritization?

0,"Development of Artificial Intelligence application requires both technological and human resources. The requirement of a skilled computational workforce has made AI applications closely linked with the emerging data science profession. In this paper I draw from sociology of science and technology to discuss the application of AI and data science tools  into the design and delivery of public services. The perspective of data scientists is contrasted with the tools and practices of more established quantitative professions, such as statisticians, economists, and management analysts. The findings draw from 39 interviews with experts of quantitative and computational tools in the UK non-profit sector. The UK non-profit sector is closely linked with the UK government through contracting and collaboration, making it central to design and delivery of public services. The findings suggest that AI tools and data science applications have so far only had a minor impact on non-profit work, and is unlikely to have a major impact in the near future. In projects designed to explore new possibilities of computational tools in the non-profit sector, the signature tools of data scientists often end up not being applicable. The interviews suggest that the quantitative tools and practices currently used in the non-profit sector are supported by computational infrastructures that have become a standard part of public service design and delivery over the decades. The emerging data science profession, in contrast, draws mostly from computational infrastructures that originate from computer science and digital commerce. While data scientists as professionals can be transported to the non-profit sector, they still lack the computational environments that has enabled the recent advances in computational technology. The findings thus suggest that the potential of AI in public service design and delivery is currently restricted to a limited set of applications. New developments are better described as incremental improvements to existing computational practices. Nevertheless, the emergence of a special data science professional identity and skill set stands to have more direct implications to the non-profit sector.",The London School of Economics & Political Science,,,,,,,,The London School of Economics & Political Science,,Ville Aula,,,,,,,,Ville Aula,,Civil Society,Social Policy,Knowledge,Big Data,,,,,From statisticians to data scientists – The emergence and limitations of AI applications in public services,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63096&EventID=185
0,"During the first period of the coronavirus pandemic, Greece has emerged as a surprise since the outbreak appeared to be far more limited than what was expected especially after the long period of the debt crisis. The governmental strategy had been developed under an unprecedented political and social consensus. During the first period of the crisis (March-June 2020) the governmental campaign (Stay at Home-Stay Safe) was supported by one positive and one negative underlying messages. The positive activated the feeling of social responsibility: I stay home to protect others. The negative activated the feeling of fear: I stay home because an invisible enemy is out there threatening me. Both were highly influential messages, especially when supported by the government campaign and the cultivation of fear and panic in the news coverage. During the second and the third period of the crisis (2021-2022) the governmental strategy was focused on the vaccination campaign. Therefore, the high case fatality ratios and the long lasting lockdowns transformed the political and social consensus to a polarized political and social reaction. 
The paper builds upon the political parallelism hypothesis to understand how governmental campaigns, newer and older media and social reactions converge and compete in the production and articulation of hegemonic and counter discourses in order to take up a more integrative concept of the framing strategies of actors and explain mechanisms of consensus and polarization. This attempt brings in light some interesting assumptions concerning the process of frame building through a process of “frame competing” and “frame alignment” during periods of crisis in order to understand how political, social and media actors with unequal resources develop frames about an issue and try to establish these in the public discourse. Our scope is to examine how, in Greece during the two periods of coronavirus crisis, the process of building consensus or polarized frames by media actors, political actors and social actors through social media (Facebook comments) fed the public discourse. 
We will treat the above hypotheses using frame analysis as a methodological tool. Our data consists of a. the prime minister speeches for the Covid (addres to the Nation, parliament, announcement of measures) b.12.000 article of online editions of newspapers and c. Facebook comments on selected articles. All coding will be based on dictionary political text analysis and on a mix of inductive and deductive qualitative and quantitative content analysis. Our scope is to find the find the line from the political to the media and then to the social frame building process. Our main research questions are: 
RQ 1: What were the dominant and critical frames used to coronavirus discussion? We focus on the frame building process and especially on the competitive frames promoted by political, media and social actors during the two covid periods.
RQ 2: To what extent those frames interacted in order to create generic frames? We focus on the frame alignment process as an integrated approach trying to understand the multiple interactions creating  consensus and polarized frames.",Panteion University of Social and Political Sciences,Panteion University of Social and Political Sciences,,,,,,,Panteion University of Social and Political Sciences,,Andreas Kollias,Fani Kountouri,,,,,,,Fani Kountouri,,Governance,Media,Political Leadership,Internet,Social Media,Communication,Narratives,Policy Implementation,"From the consensus to the polarisation on the covid crisis:  Political campaigns, media coverage and Facebook reactions in Greece",https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65753&EventID=185
0,"Critical accounts of the Eurozone crisis and its social and political fallout have often centred class as a tool for inquiry (e.g. Bieling, 2015; Lapavitsas et al., 2012; Ryner, 2015). Gendered accounts, less frequently used as a tool for analysis, focused mostly on gendered consequences of the crisis and its management (Jacquot, 2017; Karamessini & Rubery, 2013) , while intersectional accounts of the crisis, rarer still, drew attention to the question: “Whose crisis counts” (Bassel & Emejulu, 2017, S. 33)? Whose crisis was it in the first place, and whose experiences of precariousness or insecurity count as constituting a “crisis” that requires universal attention and immediate policy action; and similarly whose recovery counts (Cavaghan & O’Dwyer, 2018)? Yet with a few exceptions (Bruff & Wöhl, 2016; O’Dwyer, 2018), neither gender nor intersectionality have been used as tools to analyse the political logics of the crisis and its management; how class, gender, ethnicity and race have been mobilised politically to justify an austerity-driven redistribution of resources in the context of the crisis. 
This paper seeks to begin addressing this missing link with an agential focus, through performances and mediatised representations of key actors in the public discourse of the crisis. Drawing on case studies of ECB presidents Jean-Claude Trichet and Mario Draghi, and of heads of government Angela Merkel and Silvio Berlusconi, the paper examines the dynamics of performances and media representations on the contested terrain of crisis politics, and how meanings of gender and ethnicity are deployed in that context. The paper argues that through representations of frugal femininities, and disciplinary and profligate masculinities, gender and ethnicity provide rich metaphorical resources to associate politico-economic decisions with dominant cultural and moral discourses, producing (de)legitimising effects that enable certain crisis responses and silence others. It thus seeks to contribute to conceptualising how power relations of gender and ethnicity are mobilised in the practices of elite actors, and mediatised to a wider audience, in the context of crisis ‘events’ (Brassett & Clarke, 2012); and therefore to understand the contingency of intersectional world-making in the political economy.",Johannes Kepler Universität Linz,,,,,,,,Johannes Kepler Universität Linz,,Frederic Heine,,,,,,,,Frederic Heine,,European Politics,Gender,National Identity,Political Economy,Eurozone,,,,"Frugal femininities and profligate masculinities: Gender performances, ethnicity and the political economy of the Eurozone crisis",https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64710&EventID=185
0,"The antagonistic discourse and lack of communicative truthfulness have become prominent aspects of contemporary politics in many European countries. The populist rhetoric dividing society between ""us"" and ""them"",  attacks toward opposing politicians, and incivility in elite communication have become especially salient given an increase in political polarization during the COVID-19 pandemic crisis. Such communication can be accelerated by social media, which gives the politicians an unmediated access to the people with similar views and positions. Extant research has brought important insights into politicians’ public engagement on social media and the effects of hostile politics on people's attitudes, showing how populist rhetoric using negative, provocative, and conflictive messages fuels strong reactions like love or anger. However, less work has been done on emotional reactions caused by polarized political communication and uncivil rhetoric in particular. This study focuses on the effects of incivility and post-truth accusations in political leaders' social media communication on emotional reactions of users responding to those posts during a crisis. Building upon concepts from populist communication and polarization, we go beyond studying the quantity of responses to elite discourse and investigate the content and contextual characteristics which affect more qualitative reactions of social media users. To do so, we analyse the communication of Czech political party leaders on Facebook during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Czech Republic makes a good case as the country went from “best in Covid”, as declared by then Prime minister Andrej Babiš in summer 2020, to the most recorded COVID-19 cases per capita in the world by autumn 2021. Though the government introduced strict measures in the beginning of the pandemic, it was still criticized for their poor crisis management. The handling of the crisis was later affected by inconsistent communication, upcoming regional elections and as a consequence, delayed and chaotic measures, as well as declining public willingness to comply combined with demands for a return to “normal life”. Applying manual claims analysis to study the leaders' public communication between March 2020 and March 2021 (2549 posts), we expect that the use of uncivil language and the presence of truth evaluations in the Facebook posts will increase the number of emotional responses of social media users. We also expect that emotional reactions will be more pronounced under populist (vs. non-populist) posts and will also differ over the course of the crisis. In particular, the different pandemic waves and pandemic topics emphasized by politicians in their posts will affect the emotional responses differently. The article has important implications for the study of how negativity, incivility and attacks on truthfulness in elite communication may help delegitimise political opponents as well as increase societal polarization and public distrust towards democratic institutions.",University of Vienna,Masaryk University,Masaryk University,,,,,,Masaryk University,,Olga Eisele,Alena Kluknavska,Martina Novotná,,,,,,Alena Kluknavska,,Elites,Political Parties,Populism,Social Media,Communication,,,,"Fuming mad or jumping with joy?

0,"How do extreme beliefs relate to extreme behavior? Recently, it has been acknowledged that to understand how certain beliefs or ideologies are linked to violent, militant, or terrorist behavior, we must engage the subjectivities and beliefs of extremists and terrorists. But what are extreme beliefs, such as fundamentalist or extremist beliefs? And how do extreme beliefs conceptually relate to cognitive and behavioral radicalization? In this paper we develop an account of fundamentalist beliefs, and explore the conceptual relation of ‘fundamentalist belief’ and ‘radicalization.’
Fundamentalist beliefs are often discussed in relation to extremist, radical, or fanaticist beliefs, or terrorist ideology. However, the conceptual links between these notions are unclear. What is more, fundamentalist beliefs are frequently defined and operationalized (for example in the field of psychology) but there is no uniform way of doing so. Despite the frequent recurrence of the term ‘fundamentalist belief’ in the literature, no clear and agreed-upon definition exists. Elements and characteristics that are commonly thought of as constituting fundamentalist beliefs are intellectual vices such as closed-mindedness or dogmatism, certain group dynamics and affections, a high degree of certainty in holding these beliefs, and fundamentalist content. Drawing on, among other things, recent developments in (social) epistemology, these alleged elements are critically reviewed. Based on this review, we develop what we call the Reaction-Content-Affect account of fundamentalist belief. This account, it is argued, is not only accurate, precise, fair, and clear, but also theoretically and practically fruitful.
On the basis of this account, we turn to the conceptual relation between ‘fundamentalist belief’ and ‘radicalization,’ zooming in on the relation between fundamentalist belief and cognitive radicalization. We conclude by sketching various ways in which cognitive radicalization might be understood in light of our analysis of fundamentalist belief.

0,"A burgeoning literature has demonstrated the growing complexity of the regimes that aim to address global public policy. The number, diversity and interconnectedness of International Organisations (IOs) have increased steadily over the last thirty years. One of the consequences of this trend is the rising complexity of funding regimes. For example, IOs in the global development regime now routinely co-finance projects with other IOs, work side by side with public-private partnerships and set up trust funds to channel new resources to donors’ priorities. As a result, earmarked funding is on the rise. The consequences of this development for the success of IO operations are insufficiently understood. We hypothesise that earmarked funding can improve the effectiveness of individual projects because the tighter accountability of earmarked funds, due to additional reporting and shorter reporting frequency, induces added effort from IO staff. However, as the depth and breadth of funding complexity within IOs’ portfolios increase, they are faced with more complex principal relationships. Such complexity can lead administrative burdens to grow, and IOs’ bargaining position vis-à-vis recipients to suffer. Consequently, we expect that more complex funding portfolios weaken IO performance overall. We test these hypotheses using a database of more than 8,000 evaluations of projects by five international development organisations (AFDB, ASDB, CDB, IFAD, World Bank) run between 1990 and 2020 in more than 150 countries. The results have important implications for debates on regime complexity and aid effectiveness by highlighting the consequences of increasing complexity of IO funding for their ability to deliver on their mandates.",London School of Economics & Political Science,University of Glasgow,,,,,,,University of Glasgow,,Ben Cormier,Mirko Heinzel,,,,,,,Mirko Heinzel,,Governance,Institutions,International Relations,Global,International,,,,Funding Complexity and the Effectiveness of International Development Organizations,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63845&EventID=185

Future Design (FD), introduced in 2015 in Japan, is a new approach to addressing this question by formulation of new theories, verifying them through experiments, and then practicing them in real communities, municipalities, and private companies. FD is ""the design and implementation of social systems that activate participants’ futurability.” Futurability refers to “the possibility that the present generation will put the interests of the future generations ahead of its own.” However, the society in which we live today based upon markets and democracy is one that suppresses our futurability. For this reason, FD concerns with designing a society where people can change their behavior by activating their own futurability. It seems that we have focused only on making our generation better that we have been making future failures that likely cause excessive burden for future generations. Such examples are disruption of carbon cycle, nitrogen cycle, phosphorus cycle, and so on, and then the concept of Imaginary Future Person (IFP) is introduced to cope with myopia and optimism of human beings. Think about flying to the future, becoming an IFP, imagining the future society, and giving advice to the present from the future. This system works quite well in laboratory and field experiments.

0,"However, Kant and Gandhi share the idea on several occasions but Gandhi’s duty ethics to help the distant others departs from Kantian rationalist cosmopolitan ethics which informs most of the contemporary Western cosmopolitanism. Gandhi, unlike most of the Western liberals, does not view life as an alienated and fragmented concept rather he believes in the idea of shared humanity, a life which is deeply connected with each other including nature. Going beyond the rationalist and modernist justification for this moral interdependence, Gandhi (1909) in his seminal work, “Hind Swaraj” questions this mentality and argues that our life is essentially ‘unalienated’. According to Gandhi, the whole world is a “family” and we inhabit the same humanity. We all are morally and socially connected, our duties and responsibilities impact each other’s well-being. In Young India (1924) Gandhi wrote, “I want to identify myself with everything that lives. He believed in the essential unity of mankind. 
The proposed paper is a humble attempt to explore, why Western moral cosmopolitanism despite being philosophically sound, could not address the global poverty, especially in the Global South and we collectively as a society have failed in alleviating it. It also tries to explore why right-based approach of Western moral cosmopolitanism could not ground an idea of agency and duty ethics to alleviate global poverty. Gandhi, going beyond positivist understanding of the nature of global poverty, motivates individuals to be compassionate and help the poor across the globe, even though if they are not the direct cause of their poverty. He says, since we share the same humanity, it is our moral duty to help our fellow being. Gandhi’s duty ethics to help the distant ‘others’ is based on the idea of human sentiment and compassion. Gandhi’s individual is not a possessive individual, unlike western liberal individual; he is not an “owner” rather a “trustee”. In the Harijan, 1-2-1942, Gandhi discusses the “Duty of the Rich”, and he says that “The rich should ponder well as to what their duty is today. They who employ mercenaries to guard their wealth may find those very guardians turning on them.” 
Western liberal cosmopolitans like Pogge and Caney do prescribe negative and positive ‘duty of justice’ to help the global poor respectively but they are trapped in the logic of either institutional or interactional imperative rather than realizing the intrinsic value of shared humanity. I argue that Gandhian idea of socially connected needs and the harm principles has much broader moral outlook than most of the Western cosmopolitan frameworks. Gandhi says: “We are socially so connected that even a single penny on luxury may inflict harm in one or another way on the destitute who are in dire need of our help.” This is what I call Gandhi’s sentimental cosmopolitanism, primarily based on “Karuna” (compassion) and “Ahimsa” (non-violence) and Asteya (non-stealing). 
I argue that Gandhian understanding of moral interdependence has potential to come up with be a plausible non-Western alternative of distributive obligations what I call “agency of shared humanity”.",University of Delhi (India),,,,,,,,University of Delhi (India),,Santosh Kumar,,,,,,,,Santosh Kumar,,India,Global,Ethics,Liberalism,,,,,Gandhi’s Sentimental Cosmopolitanism and Duty to Alleviate Global Poverty: An Indian Response to the West,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64464&EventID=185
0,"The ever-present topic of gender inequality has been on the agenda of policymakers around the globe (Ford and Pande 2011). The lack of female representation on corporate boards correspondingly raised the attention of scholars (Hillman et al. 2007), practitioners as well as civil society. It seems to represent one of the important columns to build up gender equality in society (Chizema, Kamuriwo, and Shinozawa 2015).

Although electoral quotas for women existed in the 1970ies only for a handful of countries, nowadays they are implemented in more than 130 countries all over the world. (Meier 2013) Corporate board quotas have also started to increase in the last decades, especially in Europe. (Hughes, Paxton, and Krook 2017) That explains why a lot of research has been dedicated to women on boards of corporations. Although a vast majority of research has been done on the characteristics of women on boards (Gamba and Goldstein 2009; Ruigrok, Peck, and Tacheva 2007; Singh and Vinnicombe 2004; Zelechowski and Bilimoria 2004), as well as on the impact  female board members have on the (financial or economic) performance of a corporation (Bear, Rahman, and Post 2010; Reddy and Jadhav 2019) there has been little research on the effect a gender diverse board has on the corporation in general. 

Female board members may contribute to issues of recruitment, retention, development and so which then contribute to the advancement of women in executive management. (Bilimoria 2006) That supports that female participation in executive management e.g. the compensation committee leads to equality in terms of compensation for both genders (Elkinawy and Stater 2011). Companies with more women on the board tend to have more women in executive management (Matsa and Miller 2011). It is argued that these, executive managers have the leadership position to make key employment decisions (Stainback, Kleiner, and Skaggs 2016). However, are there trickle-down effects to lower management levels? Kirsch and Wrohlich identified in their study trickle-down effects from the supervisory board to the executive board in Germany (Kirsch and Wrohlich 2020). However what is with the top, middle and lower management? Does a gender diverse board contribute towards an overall gender equality in a corporation?
This paper aims first to review the literature on the consequences of gender diversity in organizations in order to understand what aspects scholars focused on so far, and whether and why diversity in the board room is a goal worthwhile pursuing in connection with gender equality outcomes for a corporation according to their research. The second aim is to identify and describe the gap regarding board diversity and its impact on gender equality for a corporation. This leads to a broad research agenda and a research plan to fill this gap in academic literature.

0,"The conceptualisation of gender is a key battleground for populist ideology, with a quasi-return to ‘traditional’ gender roles and responsibilities central to the populist reimaginings of the state. 
Authoritarianism thrives in binary discourses and the construction of threat through challenges to perceived stability: stability which is frequently epitomised by the heterosexual nuclear family. The image of the stable family reinforces a clear division of reproductive labour and the expectation for national identity to be consolidated and reinforced through child-rearing. These discourses are also frequently racialised in response to constructed threats from beyond (or within) national borders. Deviation from, in terms of personal gender identity and expression, and challenges to, in terms of academic theorisation, these hegemonic binaries are therefore perceived as threats to the imagined nation or failures to uphold ‘patriotic’ duty. The threat of gender diversity therefore brings higher education institutions into this key battleground in which the academic study of gender, sexuality and feminism, which overtly contest, problematise and expose these narrow discourses, is pitted against conservative political stand-points often within as well as outside those same institutions. This paper explores examples of these tensions affecting higher education in the contexts of Hungary, the UK and Turkey, building on research conducted through the collaborative project Universities and Crisis. Through exploring these examples I propose that these conflicts may be generative sites for the creation and consolidation of new solidarities across academic, activist and civil society spheres which offer a response to questions of the public role of the university.",University of Cambridge,,,,,,,,University of Cambridge,,Elizabeth Maber,,,,,,,,Elizabeth Maber,,Conflict,Gender,Nationalism,Populism,Knowledge,Feminism,Global,Higher Education,Gender diversity and academic solidarities in response to authoritarianism and crisis,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65411&EventID=185
0,"The COVID-19 pandemic led - among other things - to a number of legislative regulations and the need for ideally simultaneous reflection on their potential undesired effects. One of the most important regulatory acts in Czechia was a school lockdown which resulted – among other things – in the need to design financial allowances for parents who could not go to work as they took care of their children and the conditions of the allowances. Another important agenda was the restriction of the operation of small businesses which also resulted in a specific design of financial compensations. As it was suggested already in the first weeks of 2020 lockdown and as it has been soundly documented by numerous studies, women as a group are dramatically affected both by the pandemic itself and by the related restrictions (as health care workers, social care workers, teachers, care-givers, precarious workers).
The aim of my paper is to present the establishment and the way of operation of the “Working Group on the Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Gender Equality” (WG) – established within the Government Council for Gender Equality, an advisory body to the Czech government. Using the depiction and analysis of how the WG was established, the conditions under which it worked and communicated, and how it ended its work, I would like to capture the emotional layer of expertise that was part of the feedback that individual members as a collective body provided to the government.
The interim results of my research show that for the members of the group, there was an emotional tension present in their activities resulting from the clash of several sources: (a) a desire to help with expertise in a challenging situation and in an area of gender equality which they considered important; (b) doubts about the importance of gender equality agenda face-to-face to a disaster of an overloaded health care system and tens of thousands deads; (c) doubts about the group's set-up and its outcomes, in the broader context of the government's long-term reserved approach to gender equality; and (d) doubts about whether investing the time and efforts was worth it in the context of personal challenges caused by the pandemic, where it was difficult to reconcile work, personal and professional life. 
The dataset will consist of interviews with experts from the WG, with administrative staff at the Cabinet Office, with a government commissioner who was able to attend government meetings, with the former Minister of Labour and Social Affairs. Another important part will be the communication between members of the WG and the outputs of their work.

0,"The primary aim of this paper is to understand how key left and right-leaning parties approach women’s issues, e.g. abortion, maternity leave, or women’s employment discrimination, in the multi-dimensional political space. Defining political cleavage as “a long-lasting political division”, the paper utilizes existing variation in the key political cleavages in new democracies. The paper highlights that the primary political cleavage in a particular country at a particular time serves as a crucial prism through which specific women’s issues tend to be filtered and politicized by major left and right-leaning parties. One the one hand, some examples testify that key political cleavages can be potentially fatal to certain types of women’s issues. For instance, women’s health issues can run the danger of being highly contested healthcare issues in the U.S.; women’s reproductive or marital rights can overlap with conflictual religious cleavage in Latin America; and in Japan, war-time comfort women issues can face resistance from right-wing forces whose key ideological identity can be derived from being unapologetic about war-time crimes and rearming Japan to a “normal state”. On the other hand, evidence also suggest that, in new democracies like South Korea or Taiwan, the key concerns of left and right-leaning parties have not overlapped with women’s issues in the mainstream politics—diplomatic or military stance toward North Korea (South Korea) and toward Mainland China (Taiwan); as a result, issues concerning the promotion of women often have been treated as a valence issue key parties utilize to maximize votes. Against this background, the paper demonstrates how specific women’s issues become politicized and divisive based on a comparative case study of four non-western democracies whose key political cleavages revolve around non-socioeconomic ones.",Freie Universität Berlin,German Institute for Global And Area Studies,,,,,,,German Institute for Global And Area Studies,,Elena Korshenko,Jaemin Shim,,,,,,,Jaemin Shim,,Cleavages,Gender,Political Competition,Feminism,Comparative Perspective,National Perspective,Party Systems,,Gender Politics in Multi-Dimensional Political Space: A Comparative Analysis of Intersection between Key Political Cleavages and Women’s Issues,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64661&EventID=185
0,"Hitherto, most research on women and social movements has mainly focused on feminists movements while it has overlooked the roles and experiences of women within those movements that don’t organize on the basis of gender. Bearing in mind that social movements provide a fundamental avenue for disadvantaged groups to improve their representation, it is fundamental to acknowledge that social movements are gendered. Several scholars have documented how inter-movement dynamics, framing process and tactics evoke particular meanings of gender regarding femininity and masculinity, and at the same time re(produce) gender power relations. Furthermore, gender intersects with other social axes, such as sexuality, gender identity, race and ability, which construct particular meanings in different social contexts and shape the political participation and representation of those at the intersection of multiple identities. Therefore, the article aims to unveil both the gendered aspects and the gendered representation claims put forward by social movements. Accordingly, I propose a comparative case study that builds on feminist institutionalism. Such an approach has been proven to be fruitful when studying the gendered dynamics of formal organizations, such as political parties, because it allows to identify those social norms about gender that shape women’s experiences and (re)produce power relations between women and men. Hence, I argue it is a useful approach to unveil those gendered norms that hinder the effective participation and representation of women within social movements. In particular, the empirical analysis compares the internal dynamics and representation claims put forward by the LGBT movement, the antiracist movement, and the disability rights movements in Catalonia. The analysis builds on interviews with women who participate in the abovementioned movements and on documents written by them. And the data is analyzed using interpretive process tracing with a grounded approach. Finally, this paper aims to contribute to social movement literature and feminist scholarship on gender within the context of social movements by offering a greater understanding on how different interlocking social axes of difference shape the participation and representation of women.",Universitat Pompeu Fabra,,,,,,,,Universitat Pompeu Fabra,,Marina Muñoz Puig,,,,,,,,Marina Muñoz Puig,,Gender,Social Movements,Feminism,Race,LGBTQI,,,,"Gender, social movements, and norms: where are the women in movements?",https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63572&EventID=185

We argue that international organizations are gendered in unique and consequential ways, which we investigate through the experiences of civilian women in UN peace operations. We adopt a three-pronged, mixed methods strategy. First, on the basis of UN official statistics, we demonstrate that civilian women are underrepresented in UN peace operations. While civilian women’s representation in UN peace operations has increased since 2017, gains have been modest and uneven across locations and staff categories. Second, we examine gender-disaggregated responses to four internal UN surveys of peace operations staff. We find that civilian women report significantly more negative perceptions of their work environment than their male counterparts. Third, we use UN documents and interviews to highlight how employees of different genders experience work-related pressures. We find that civilian women face greater challenges than their male colleagues, which are exacerbated by the risks, the expectations of mobility, and the ‘bunkerized’ environment typical for UN peace operations.",University of British Columbia,University of Warwick,University of British Columbia,Kings College London,,,,,Kings College London,,Katharina Coleman,Jessica Di Salvatore,Joshua Fawcett-Weiner,Kseniya Oksamytna,,,,,Kseniya Oksamytna,,Gender,Governance,Representation,UN,Global,Peace,,,Gendered International Organizations and the UN Civilian Peacekeeping Workforce,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63339&EventID=185
0,"Measures of outgroup attitudes may not necessarily be comparable across different country contexts. We argue that androcentric bias – the propensity of individuals to imagine men rather than women, and to evaluate men more negatively than women – is more prevalent in some countries than in others. Specifically, androcentric bias hampers accurate conclusions when researchers compare the attitudes of respondents who use a grammatically gendered language with the attitudes of respondents who use a natural gender or a genderless language. To test our claims, we conducted nationally representative survey experiments with over 19,500 respondents in thirteen European countries. We randomly assigned respondents to evaluate: (a) masculine or gender neutral nouns; or (b)""feminized"" alternatives. Feminized versions of outgroups evoked more favorable evaluations. Moreover, this positive effect was stronger in grammatically gendered languages. Our findings suggest that using gender-equal binomial word-pairs bolsters comparability, and prevents the erasure of women as sociopolitically relevant actors.","Faculty of Social and Economic Sciences, Comenius University","Faculty of Social and Economic Sciences, Comenius University",,,,,,,"Faculty of Social and Economic Sciences, Comenius University",,Andrej Findor,Roman Hlatky,,,,,,,Andrej Findor,,Gender,Political Psychology,Feminism,Quantitative,Experimental Design,Public Opinion,Survey Experiments,Survey Research,"Gendered Language, Androcentric Bias, and Outgroup Attitudes",https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64071&EventID=185
0,"This paper examines the electoral consequences of media coverage when it comes to legislators’ representation efforts concerning women’s issues such as sexual harassment, abortion, domestic violence reduction, or maternity leave. A wide range of empirical evidence drawn from multiple world regions demonstrate that, insofar as women’s issues are concerned, female legislators are more likely to prioritize in the legislature and receive more media attention. At the same time, research shows that strong emphasis on women’s issues can be stigmatizing since the corresponding legislators can be labelled as “angry feminists” by the public. Moreover, it can also be detrimental to legislators’ career within their parties since many feminist platforms tend to challenge entrenched interests—such as the patriarchal, religious, and class status quo—and demand the equal distribution of political power. Based on two underexplored cases in the gender and media scholarship—South Korea and Taiwan—the paper investigates whether and to what extent legislators receiving media coverage related to women’s issues promotion affect their re-election chances. For this goal, the paper first examines 30,000 articles from four major newspapers which include all elected legislators between 2012 and 2020 in both countries. Then, regression analysis is applied to investigate the effect of media coverage on re-election by examining how far specific incumbent legislator went in relation to the next election, i.e. aspirant, applicant, candidate, and elected (Norris and Lovenduski, 1995), by distinguishing whether specific incumbent legislators applied to their party to run for re-election, successfully received nomination, and got re-elected. Preliminary results demonstrate that, in general, media’s portrayal of women’s issue promotion have a negative effect on legislator’s re-election chance and the effect was stronger at the party-nomination stage than at the voter selection stage. Moreover, this patten tended to be particularly pronounced for female legislators pointing that the media effect is gendered. By focusing on women’s issues, the paper demonstrates an important conditionality behind the media’s electoral effect—that more media coverage is not necessarily electorally advantageous for legislators in certain areas—and calls for a more policy-specific approach to be taken in future research.",German Institute for Global And Area Studies,,,,,,,,German Institute for Global And Area Studies,,Jaemin Shim,,,,,,,,Jaemin Shim,,Asia,Gender,Media,Political Competition,Political Parties,Feminism,Communication,Comparative Perspective,Gendered media coverage and electoral consequences in East Asia: A comparative analysis of male and female legislators in newspapers,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64648&EventID=185
0,"Which normative institutional theory can best explain the current ‘democratic malaise’? Questions about how to evaluate a social order and how to show that democratic orders perform well have been answered by two competing narratives. According to the proceduralist narrative, the value of a democracy, and a social order more generally, ought to be measured by the values instantiated intrinsically in its procedures. In the same vein, the values intrinsic in its procedures are what justifies a democratic order over others. By contrast, according to the instrumentalist narrative, the value of a social order is measured by the output it produces. In keeping with this output-focused perspective, instrumentalists believe that a democratic order is justified over others because democratic decision procedures tend to cause better outcomes.
We will show that neither of these two narratives is fully convincing. The proceduralist narrative does not provide a plausible account of justification because the values intrinsic to the procedure are at best necessary but not sufficient. After all, a decision procedure that embodies the relevant intrinsic values but fails to produce any valuable outcomes is difficult to justify all-things-considered. This is not to deny that intrinsic values can make a procedure more valuable – the objection against proceduralism applied to democracy is rather that any convincing justification of democracy must at least pay some attention to outcomes. 
The instrumentalist account has different problems: First, it pays no attention to valuable intrinsic features like fairness, as the proceduralist correctly points out. Second, it struggles to explain how the standard used to measure the value of democracy is determined and justified. Strangely, this standard is often assumed to be fixed. Most epistemic justifications of democracy, for example, see democracy as a successful procedure in terms of its “truth-tracking”, where “the truth” to be tracked is some kind of fixed, procedure-independent set of facts. Such external standards, however, typically remain under-defined and, when fleshed out, look implausible.
We will maintain that neither the proceduralist nor the instrumentalist view provide a satisfactory account of what justifies democracy. Instead, we propose a new method for evaluating social orders, i.e. the rules and procedures of society. We call this method Generativism:
Generativism. The value of a social order (or part thereof) depends on its intrinsic features and on its effects on the outer, mental and normative state of society and possibly external effects. Which intrinsic and instrumental features matter and how they matter is determined by universal and contextual standards.
Generativism is a broad church view – it acknowledges that the value of a social order can depend on both properties intrinsic to its procedures and on instrumental features reflected in the outer, mental and normative state of society. In doing so, Generativism can provides a handle on problems of democratic decay in ways that other normative theories of democracy don’t.",The London School of Economics & Political Science,,,,,,,,The London School of Economics & Political Science,,Kai Spiekermann,,,,,,,,Kai Spiekermann,,Democracy,Political Theory,Populism,Normative Theory,,,,,Generative Democracy and the Dynamics of Social Orders,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=66053&EventID=185
0,"How do geographic cleavages shape political grievances and lead to affective polarization? Previous scholarship has measured place-based resentment in the American context. In this regard, resentment of rural citizens vis-à-vis urbanites has been empirically linked to support for right-wing populists, including the election of Trump. On the other side of the Atlantic, scholars have linked rural grievances to the leave campaign in the Brexit referendum. We build on this literature to study the effects of geographic cleavages on affective polarization in the Norwegian context. Taking a social identity approach to studying geographic cleavages, we leverage original survey data from the Norwegian Citizen Panel. We ask a series of questions to measure the strength of in-group attachments to rural or urban lifestyles, as well as attachment to Oslo or other geographic regions. We also gauge people’s attitudes towards geographic out-groups. We take the difference between in-group attachment versus out-group attitudes to measure affective polarization in regard to geographic identities.

0,"Since the onset of the eurozone crisis more than a decade ago, Germany moved centre-stage as the 'reluctant hegemon' (Paterson 2011) who used its semi-hegemonic position to determine the reform of the eurozone governance architecture. In this context it has been argued that Germany would lack the resources to act as a true hegemon while simultaneously pursuing its economic self-interest more effectively than other EU members (Kundnani 2019). In policy terms, it can be argued that Germany pursuing supranational public policy on its own is usually doomed to fail. This is even more likely since Germany is regarded as weakened in economic and political terms by quite a number of observers with likely repercussions (Artus 2019). Leadership via the EU-framework (Janning&Möller 2016) will inevitably have to be combined with more ‘integration by differentiation’ (Gujer 2018) and addressing Germany’s current account surpluses which are usually regarded as excessive at least outside of Germany (Dieter 2018) and partly also within the Federal Republic (e.g. Truger 2019).
This paper compares contrasting theoretical approaches on Germany’s alleged hegemony – or ‘central power’ role (Streeck 2022) - and considers the potential of the new Germany three party ‘traffic-light’ coalition government between the SPD, the Greens and the FDP in creating a new macroeconomic policy consensus domestically and subsequently also in the eurozone and in the wider Single Market. In this context the paper analyses both the current debate on redesigning EU fiscal rules after the current crisis and the controversies regarding the normalisation of monetary policy against the backdrop of potentially lasting inflationary pressure due to bottlenecks which were predominantly initiated by the economic shocks caused by the Covid pandemic. The core question is if Germany in the post-Merkel era can achieve a credible fiscal framework for the eurozone to assign appropriate responsibilities which takes account of the current macroeconomic context and alternative monetary policies. This has to be done against the background of political volatility amongst Germany’s partners in the EU - most significantly in Italy and France- and of a risky period of stagflation in a number of EU countries, including Germany itself, which has important implications for both financial policy and wage policies.",Hochschule Düsseldorf,,,,,,,,Hochschule Düsseldorf,,Lothar Funk,,,,,,,,Lothar Funk,,European Politics,European Union,Political Economy,Political Leadership,Eurozone,,,,"German Hegemony in the Eurozone and the European Union:  Myth, Lasting or Lost?",https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63496&EventID=185
0,"Germany has witnessed the gradual fragmentation of its party system since the 1980s as a result of the growing diversity of societal interests, which became particularly noticeable in the aftermath of reunification. The formation of minimal winning governing coalitions has consequently become more complex and tended to include more than two parties on the regional Länder level. On the federal level, the new diversity has resulted in the choice between a CDU/CSU-SPD grand coalition and alternative coalitions involving three parties. While the Jamaica option failed to materialise after the 2017 federal election, the weak performance of the CDU/CSU at the most recent election in September 2021 opened the path towards the formation of the first three-party coalition on the federal level. The Traffic Light coalition between SPD, Greens and the FDP allowed the SPD to regain the office of chancellor for the first time since 2005.

0,"International organizations (IOs) have been the subject of extensive criticism since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Although the role of these global governance institutions in responding to such a cross-border crisis cannot be overemphasized, as the virus has spread around the world, IOs have struggled to keep pace with the virus’s impact, while their institutional and political vulnerabilities have become more readily apparent. This paper focuses on one salient factor contributing to the struggle of IOs in the face of COVID-19: the deficient cooperation exhibited between the multiple multilateral institutions stepping up to respond to the cross-sectoral crisis in today’s fragmented global governance system. Against this backdrop, and after highlighting the gaps in existing debates on the polycentric global governance system—the fragmentation debate in international law and the regime complexity debate in international relations—this paper makes three interrelated arguments. First, descriptively, it submits that the COVID-19 crisis has exposed the pressing challenges of cooperation and coordination confronting IOs when called upon to address multisectoral, cross-boundary crises. Second, normatively, the article argues that COVID-19 has illuminated the need to develop conceptual, legal, and institutional mechanisms that may not only prevent or solve normative and institutional collisions (a preoccupation of much of the existing debates), but also positively foster cooperation and facilitate concerted global action by multilateral institutions in view of problems that cut across the remit of multiple IOs. Third, the article asserts that by foregrounding cooperation between IOs as a vital-yet-deficient form of governance in today’s international order, COVID-19 invites us to rethink and reconceptualize our understanding of multilateral international cooperation. More concretely, the article advances the concept of “global network multilateralism”, arguing that rather than seeing IOs as isolated multilateral structures established by states to govern discrete areas of international affairs, these multilateral organizations should be viewed as part of an interconnected, interdependent, and multi-sectoral network of global governance.",Bar Ilan University,Bar Ilan University,,,,,,,Bar Ilan University,,Mor Mitrani,Sivan Shlomo Agon,,,,,,,Mor Mitrani,,Governance,Institutions,Global,,,,,,Global Networked Multilateralism: International Organizations in a Post-COVID World,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63385&EventID=185

Glocal governance is discussed as a part of an ongoing global transformation process, overall in the theoretical and academic debate about the quality of democracy, governance,  IR, change theories, and Social Movements; starting in the 1990s, when democracy and individualizing responsibilities through business and CSOs to governance became the dominant political system worldwide until today's dawn of a New Cold War between those countries which democratized and those who did not. 
In this paper, I will discuss glocal governance as a conceptual framework aiming to understand new modes of governance, between global organizations, national governments, and local/urban governance. It is a concept at the crossroad between Internationalization/ Globalization, and localization/urbanization of public affairs. It assesses issues of failed state-building, backsliding of democracies and autocratization, globally, as well as glocal social movements and the replacement of governmental institutions as well as public affairs, by private actors, non-state actors, international donors, CSOs, and business, locally. It is a conceptual framework to understand political and social paradigm shifts and explains the local-global connectivity and implementation of global norms and concepts, such as human rights and democracy, on local and community levels.
Thus far, International Relations (IR) has best responded to the global paradigm shift in national and local governance. For IR scholars, the Nation-State is no longer the key actor in IR, and hence it should be called Glocal Relations (GR) instead. GR encompasses all possible levels and stakeholders that govern when solving cross-border conflicts. They reckon that state authorities and national governments play a less significant role in managing border conflicts, consequences of climate change, or cyber security, let alone a pandemic. 
Instead, local actors adhere to global norms and principles and best practices when solving problems, as seen during the 2020-2022 global pandemic, and in return, international organizations and agencies address their problem-solving strategies directly toward local actors, as can best be seen in the 2015 - 2030 SDG Agenda. 
Global governance theorists, illustrate that global principles based on human rights, democracy, and the rule of law adopted by national and local authorities can lead to norm contestations and conflicts. That can lead to faster solutions locally.

0,"Populists Radical Right (PRR) parties’ growth in contemporary democracies has met with increasing interest among political science scholars in recent years, also due to the process of partial access to mainstream and institutional power they are experiencing in several countries. However, this process has been studied mainly at the national level, approaching PRR parties almost exclusively as (supra) national, aggregated and homogeneous actors: a major gap in the academic debate, also considering the relevant role played by territorial anchorage and local attachments for these formations. We know little about PRR experience of government at the local level, and in this respect France is a particularly interesting case to study. While the Rassemblement National (RN) of Marine Le Pen has never succeeded in reaching power at the national level, it has won many local elections over the last decade: in 2014 the RN has taken over councils of 11 small or middle-sized cities, and in 2020 most RN mayors has been re-elected. How did the RN’s local leaders get to the top of city's government? How did they manage to stay in power? Which are the main socio-political processes produced at the local level by this new access to power?
In our contribution, we will explore these three research questions, basing on an in-depth and comparative study of two middle-sized towns ruled since 2014 by the RN and both located in the South of France, in a region characterized by an historical cultural rootedness for the party, but where local government still remains a relatively new experience. More specifically, our paper draws on a) ethnographic observations of the local political and party life; b) 70 in-depth interviews with the members of the RN municipal team; grassroots party militants; and their main opponents (both elected in the municipality and/or active in civil society).
First, the presentation will focus on the social and political conditions of the access to local power in each city. We will show that, in both cases, the failure of local democracy pushed the RN from the marginality to the mainstream. Second, we will study the main socio-political choices and strategies adopted by the RN once in power. We will argue that the party local government can be described as an attempt to implement an illiberal local democracy, combining forms of plebiscitary democracy (projecting an image of proximity to ’the people’) with assaults on local counterpowers (political opposition, local press, civic associations).Third, we will shed light on the process of social, cultural and political polarization produced in the two cities by the access to power of the party, focusing on the main patterns of opposition we discovered during our fieldwork (cultural repertories, political strategies, typologies of networks activated).
To sum up, our paper will give empirical substance to the process of PRR parties’ territorial anchorage and innovate the methodological approach to PRR’s study, summing the advantages of the qualitative/ethnographic single case-study with the strength offered by a comparative gaze.",Sciences Po Paris,Université Paris Dauphine-PSL,,,,,,,Sciences Po Paris,Université Paris Dauphine-PSL,Elisa Bellè,Felicien Faury,,,,,,,Elisa Bellè,Felicien Faury,Democracy,Local Government,Political Leadership,Political Parties,Populism,Methods,Qualitative Comparative Analysis,,"Going Local, Going Strong?

0,"This article investigates the local dimension of the Radical Right's discourse on migration. In a first step, this paper analyzes whether radical right parties adjust their communication to the local context. While these parties portray migration mainly as a cultural threat, they can be expected to highlight economic aspects of migration in economically deprived constituencies. In a second step, this paper zeroes in on the consequences of radical right's communication on migration for local party competition. It is examined how centre-left and centre-right parties react to the framing of the radical right and whether their responses differ locally. Here, I hypothesize that the reaction of mainstream parties hinges on the electoral threat by the radical right. The more electorally threatening radical right candidates are, the more centre-left and centre-right candidates engage with the framing of the radical right candidate in their constituency. The empirical analysis relies on a newly compiled dataset consisting of social media posts on Twitter and Facebook by candidates running in the 2017 German parliamentary elections as well as state-level members of parliament. The framing of these posts is first identified using a supervised machine-learning approach before matching them with contextual data of candidates' constituencies.",European University Institute,,,,,,,,European University Institute,,Mirko Wegemann,,,,,,,,Mirko Wegemann,,Ethnic Conflict,Political Parties,Populism,Communication,Big Data,,,,Going Local?

Despite being central in determining the trade-offs involved in going negative, we still don’t know why the cost of going negative is greater in some cases than in others. We argue that the context of attacks matter and that voters, despite disapproving of negativity in general, are less likely to withdraw political support when they lack better electoral alternatives. We test the availability and ideological attractiveness of alternatives as contextual moderators of the negative campaigning backlash effect at the election, party and voter-level by linking a cross-sectional post-election survey with an expert survey on campaigning strategies, covering the 2019 elections to the European parliament in 28 countries. Estimating mixed effects multi-level models we find support for the moderating effect of alternatives at the voter-level, however not at the party or election-level.

0,"Following a period of democratic success in former post-Communist countries, political developments in the region have started to stagnate and even experienced regression. This new wave of autocratization differs from past practices. Democratic institutions and practices are slowly eroded, ruining the already fragile state of democratic progress. Governments expand their political power and significantly overshadow the legislative or the judiciary oversight by adopting illiberal laws to expand their powers. Although countries from the Central and Eastern Europe receive substantial attention, with prime examples of democratic dismantling in Hungary and Poland, the countries from Southeast Europe are not immune to this process. After a brief period of democratization in the early and mid 2000s, when democracy could barely take roots, progressive governments in the region have started to apply more and more illiberal practices that slowly eroded the minor progress achieved in the preceding period. What is surprising that these autocratization episodes came during period of increased integration to the European Union. This is in stark contrast to the countries from Central and Eastern Europe that rapidly democratized in the 1990s and early 2000s during the same integration stages. 

Considering that it is a process, rather than a one-time event, new approaches to the study of these phenomena aim to identify autocratization episodes. As authoritarianism continues to be on the rise our paper aims to explain why some countries have democratically regressed, despite the advancement of the integration process? What are the modes of autocratization in the region? What is the new form of authoritarianism that has emerged? Borrowing from both, theories of democratization and autocratization, we identify five conditions (government effectiveness, democracy aid, EU conditionality, illiberal practices, and opposition strength) that can cause our outcome of interest, autocratization. We will employ qualitative comparative analysis (QCA) in order to capture the complex nature of the problem. We use data from the World Bank, V-Dem and combining it with own dataset on democracy aid and EU conditionality in order to identify which combination of factors offers explanation to autocratization in region. Furthermore, in order to capture the different episodes of autocratization, we split our seven Western Balkans countries into different periods based on the party in power. If a party is re-elected to serve an additional government turn it will be considered as the same episode.

The article aims to provide cross-country analysis of autocratization episodes in Southeast Europe, by integrating international and domestic factors. Furthermore, we will use QCA to overcome some of the problems that recent studies face, mostly focusing on few case studies. Conversely, by focusing on government periods instead of country-year as a unit of analysis, we can also overcome some of the problems that the large-N analyses face, that is autocratization episodes that last for longer period.",Central European University,,,,,,,,Central European University,,Zdravko Veljanov,,,,,,,,Zdravko Veljanov,,Europe (Central and Eastern),Comparative Politics,Qualitative Comparative Analysis,Regression,Political Regime,,,,"Going, Going, Gone…Dismantling the Fragile Democracy and New Wave of Autocratization in Southeast Europe",https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65598&EventID=185

During this era where online interactions can even replace offline actions, Golden Dawn was the first openly neo-Nazi party after World War II to win seats in the parliament of a European country. Mainstream media banned its leaders indefinitely after Ilias Kasidiaris physically attacked Liana Kanelli, a member of the Greek Communist Party, on live television in June 2012. After the ban, many scholars seem to believe that Golden Dawn mobilised its voters online. This approach played a significant role in spreading their messages on social media while trying to appeal to wider audiences. This study samples 108 YouTube videos shared by Golden Dawn and uses Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA) to investigate the party’s activity on YouTube from 2012 to 2019. Official channels and politicians’ personal profiles are analyzed to explore their key messaging and style. Results of my analysis show that Golden Dawn’s messaging is populist, nationalist, extremist, and often adopts negative and emotional language.

0,"In migration studies, scholars differ in their emphasis on which level of government plays the central role in integration policies. There are voices drawing attention to a “local turn”, highlighting the rising power of local actors in immigrant integration. At the same time, other authors point out a “national turn” connected to the introduction of civic integration policies. Yet another point of view is supplemented with studies on the Europeanisation of migration and integration policies. In order to find out how then integration policies are governed, this article compares Austrian and Czech governance of integration policies, examining the relationship of different levels of government involved in immigrant integration. The paper founds its analysis in Scholten’s typology of centralist, localist, decoupling, and multi-level governance. It questions how different levels of government cooperate in immigrant integration governance in Austria and Czechia and how the form of immigrant integration governance changed with the implementation of civic integration measures. The research discovers that although centralist governance is observable in both cases, localist and decoupling trends appeared in the Austrian case, while a multi-level governance approach emerged with civic integration in Czechia. These results disprove the assumption of a supposedly more likely multi-level approach to govern integration policies in a federal state and a more centralised logic of governance under the unitary regime.",Charles University,,,,,,,,Charles University,,Anna Lukešová,,,,,,,,Anna Lukešová,,Governance,Integration,Local Government,Migration,National Perspective,,,,Governing integration policies in a multi-level setting:  the case of Austria and Czechia,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64841&EventID=185
0,"From the perspective of political theory, participatory democratic theory and deliberative approaches generally seem to be the natural interlocutors for the frequently asked question of how to innovate democracy. The focus is usually on mini-publics that promise to achieve two normative ideals of the respective theories at once: On the input side, the possibility of more inclusive citizen participation; on the output side, the epistemic expectation of considered judgments (Landemore 2021; Lafont 2020). This paper does not seek to deny the relevance of this perspective, but to point out two of its blind spots. First, it narrows the normative assessment of democratic innovations to questions of political opinion formation. And second, linking mini-publics and deliberative theory leaves other existing examples of democratic innovations and their further development theoretically unexplored. Against this backdrop, the aim of this paper is to broaden and deepen our understanding of democratic innovations in terms of both the normative objectives and the political problems that democratic innovations might address. To this end, I turn to the city and examine how democratic innovations can realize rights claims that have been justified with regard to questions of urban injustice such as gentrification or housing (Huber/Wolkenstein 2018; Kohn 2016). Though those claims for a right to the city or for occupancy rights of urban residents address substantial democratic values, they regularly lack legal force. This paper argues that cooperative governance provides a way to fulfill these rights by giving affected urban residents an equal say in co-shaping the city. In doing so, urban democratic innovations such as cooperative housing management or community-led districts ultimately contribute to alter our notion of property and further realize the idea of the commons in the city.",Georg-August-Universität Göttingen,,,,,,,,Georg-August-Universität Göttingen,,Verena Frick,,,,,,,,Verena Frick,,Democracy,Institutions,Political Participation,,,,,,Governing the urban commons: Democratic innovations and the right to the city,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64127&EventID=185
0,"The classic view of law is that it is a system of rules issue by the competent authorities to govern the behavior of its subjects. The famous philosopher of law Herbert Hart (1961)  stated that law contains two kind of norms, primary norms that govern the behavior of subjects and secondary norms that determine the competencies of norm setting institutions. Primary norms are ordinarily considered to be prohibitions and commands and are called behavioral norms because they prescribe or forbid certain behavior. In cases of conflict parties may approach a judge and argue that the counter party violated one of these primary norms. The function of the judiciary in this case is conflict resolution and he operates autonomous from the legislator. The judge autonomously checks whether these norms are violated, irrespective of the social consequences of the violation or of his or her verdict.
This picture of law has always been too simple, but currently authors stress that law is in a phase of transition. Law is becoming adaptive to social needs, (Arnold & Gunderson) , it sets goal oriented ‘aspirational norms’ (Westerman 2018)  which are geared towards prevention and precaution (Pieterman 2008, Arnoldussen 2016) . A key factor in this transition is the intention to prevent conflict through law, instead of resolving it after it has occurred. This transition entails a number of legal instruments that increasingly blur the line between hard law and soft law and between law and policy (Westerman 2018). 
The question is whether we do not lose something specifically law-like when law becomes an ex-ante responsive instrument of steering. My hypothesis is that Law’s transition from a fixed set of rules emphasizing legal certainty to an adaptive instrument to anticipate flexibly on social developments may entail more invasive government control than traditional legal instruments do.  
 In this paper the issue is investigated by examining the policy instrument of the ‘environmental and spatial vision’ embedded in the new forthcoming Dutch Environment and Planning Act. The need for municipalities to draft an ‘environmental vision’ is mandated by law, but is itself a non-binding document in which the municipality, together with stakeholders, formulates a vision for future development. By conducting an analysis of the municipal visions through the framework of adaptive law, we look at the ways in which social imaginaries are used to minimize or prevent social conflict and how they prefigure future, legally binding instruments. These political and social imaginaries will give insight on how coalitions of public-private governance relations are solidified and how they in turn become normative goals, irrespective of their legally binding quality.",Tilburg University,,,,,,,,Tilburg University,,Tobias Arnoldussen,,,,,,,,Tobias Arnoldussen,,Conflict,Conflict Resolution,Environmental Policy,Jurisprudence,Judicialisation,,,,"Governing through vision, the blurring line between law and policy",https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64942&EventID=185
0,"During the recent financial crisis, many European countries opted for austerity measures in healthcare by retrenching public healthcare spending and thus reducing the state's role in provision of healthcare services. These austerity-driven policy changes have often strengthened or even generated new inequalities in access to healthcare across social groups, thus having profound consequences for solidarity and equality in healthcare and welfare state as a whole. However, little is known about how governments have framed these unpopular welfare choices and in particular, how they have framed policy reforms that target specific social groups (e.g. health policies that abolish free access to primary care for specific income or age groups). The paper investigates the framing of these health policy reforms in the context of the recent financial crisis by asking the following questions: How have governments framed austerity-driven healthcare reforms in the context of recent financial crisis? Which arguments have they used to justify these measures? The paper relies upon qualitative analysis of government discourse in three countries that introduced extensive austerity-driven health reforms during the recent financial crisis: Portugal, Ireland and Greece.

0,"The world financial crisis of 2008 and the Covid-19 pandemic were responsible for the most severe global economic downturn in decades. The scale of the dislocation posed unique challenges for each of the governments of the affected countries, not least in terms of choosing appropriate crisis management tools. Therefore, with reference to the two aforementioned crisis phenomena, this article will explain the similarities and differences between the government policies of Germany, the United Kingdom and Italy, using the example of state-subsidised short-time work. Under what conditions do governments decide for or against short-time work as an instrument of crisis management? Do the conceptions of this instrument differ in duration and scope between the states - and if so: why? And finally, how can similarities and differences in reactions be explained with regard to the two crisis phenomena under investigation? The theory-driven empirical analysis provides answers to these questions by drawing on approaches to domestic preference formation. It is argued that prevailing societal problem consciousness as well as societal values and particular interests as independent variables provide explanations for government policies undertaken in times of crisis. The political decision-making process is analysed in three steps: 1) measurement of the problem awareness existing in society for the two crisis phenomena discussed; 2) discussion of the value- and interest-driven discourse within society with regard to the instrument of short-time work; 3) explanation of the respective government's decision for or against short-time work.

0,"Governmental ethics regulation has expanded in recent years both as a reaction to a perceived decline in trust caused by recurrent integrity scandals involving cabinet members and as part of a broader effort to strengthen the ethical context in which democratic governments operate. In recent years, countries have gone at great lengths in regulating governmental ethics, by setting standards of conduct to its members through hard and soft law instruments and institutionalising mechanisms to oversee and enforce those standards. Whilst all surveyed democracies have mechanisms of collective and individual political responsibility in place, there has been a shift towards more managerial disciplinary proceedings through the creation of dedicated ethics bodies. To understand these developments, this paper provides a mapping of the regulatory measures aimed at promoting integrity standards for cabinet members adopted in 14 European democracies by focusing on three key regulatory dimensions – norms, oversight, and enforcement mechanisms. The paper concludes that the effectiveness of governmental ethics regulation depends on a variety of compliance conditions, including the awareness and appropriation of ethical standards by office holders, the efficacy of oversight and enforcement mechanisms, and a dissuasive sanctions framework.
Consequently, norm-setting has shifted from etiquette regulation based largely on informal and unwritten norms to edict regulation, relying mostly on “an institutionalized system of standards, investigation and sanction” (Atkinson & Mancuso, 1992: 3). Ethical norms providing guidance proscribing unethical conduct and promoting good behaviour within organizations have become more complex and larger in scope covering more and more areas, such as political financing, asset and interest disclosure, gifts and hospitality, lobbying and the management of daily conflicts of interest. Oversight and enforcement have also changed substantially. New ethics bodies have been created, with multiple combinations of oversight and enforcement functions. This is particularly notorious in parliaments, which have, more than political parties and executives, been adopting these bodies (Coroado & de Sousa, forthcoming). There is a tendency for compliance-based approaches to integrity and a shift towards the externalisation of control, in some cases leading to a dysfunctional multiplication of entities and a diffusion of responsibility. 


Studies on the regulation of political ethics have focused mainly on parliaments and the nature and scope of norms adopted (Blomeyer, 2020; Bolleyer et al., 2020). Less attention has been paid to the oversight and enforcement capacity of ethics regimes, i.e., how ethics bodies are designed and how they operate. The regulatory landscape is highly fragmented (Demke et al., 2020) and their institutional design may vary significantly in terms of powers, composition, scope of action and even placement in the regulatory system. Their placement in the system also dictates their dynamics with the regulatees – the MPs at the individual level – and the institution they are integrated in – parliament. 

Building on the literature on ethics management, corruption control and regulation, this article looks at the institutional design of parliamentary ethics regulators and the way they operate. First, it explores the literature on parliamentary ethics systems to identify the gaps on the study of ethics bodies. Second, it explores the literature on regulatory agencies to look for standards that may guide our institutional analysis. Thirdly, it offers an overview of the variety of integrity regulators in European parliaments to then move to an in-depth analysis of four cases: France, Spain, Portugal, and the United Kingdom.",Universidade de Lisboa Instituto de Ciências Sociais,Universidade de Lisboa Instituto de Ciências Sociais,,,,,,,Universidade de Lisboa Instituto de Ciências Sociais,,Susana Coroado,Luis de Sousa,,,,,,,Susana Coroado,,Institutions,Parliaments,Ethics,,,,,,"Governmental ethics selfregulation: norms, oversight and enforcement",https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65704&EventID=185
0,"Background: Social media platforms are growingly used by citizens to search for news and political information (Mitchell et al., 2016), thus, providing important incentives for public organizations to increase their communication efforts on these platforms. Government bodies have increasingly relied on social media for encouraging participatory democracy, transmitting information about public policies and services, and improving their presentation (DePaula et al., 2018). Additionally, these platforms have been used for crisis communication, a practice that has reached unprecedented levels with the coronavirus pandemic (van Dijck & Alinejad, 2020). 
Research questions: Our study investigates RQ1) what kind of content is posted by government departments on social media and how the nature of the content has changed since the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic? RQ2) how do other social media users react to these messages? 
Data: We rely on the entire history of tweets emitted by the Swiss government departments. Then, the tweets from the most active departments are manually annotated to cover changes in the content of communication. To this aim, we extend and adapt the coding framework proposed by DePaula et al. (2018). To annotate a manageable, yet representative, number of tweets, we reduce the sample size by focusing on tweets emitted one year before the Covid-19 outbreak until December 2021. 
Methods of analysis: We assess government departments’ activity by comparing their tweeting frequency to other important government bodies (e.g. Government Ministers, Government Speaker, and Parliament). We also contextualise the observed trends with information about public reliance on social media as an information source measured with opinion survey data. To answer RQ1, we use statistical tests to highlight important changes in the communication strategies of each department before and after the Covid-19 outbreak. To answer RQ2, we investigate how the departments’ messages trigger other users’ engagement on social media relying on multivariate analysis. We especially analyse differences in users’ reactions in the form of likes, comments, and shares to distinct types of content. 
Findings: We find a number of statistically significant results. There has been a shift in content before and after the Covid-19 outbreak towards more participative and symbolic communication. However, there are variations in how departments adapted their communication strategies. Moreover, we observe different effects of the communication strategy on measures of user interaction. For instance, our results highlight that promoting symbolic messages, showing responsiveness to citizens’ concerns, and engaging in dialogue with citizens are effective strategies for government departments to trigger other users’ interaction.
Implications of the results: These findings highlight future paths of improvement to increase the public sector communication effectiveness. Most notably, our study discusses how social media platforms can be used to generate deliberative conversations between government and citizens.",Université de Lausanne,,,,,,,,Université de Lausanne,,Maud Reveilhac,,,,,,,,Maud Reveilhac,,Government,Quantitative,Social Media,Communication,,,,,Governmental information strategies and public reactions with government social media content,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63212&EventID=185
0,"Dashboards are a digital tool for reporting data visually, typically designed as a single screen dynamic overview intended to quickly and effectively present users with critical information to act upon. Following decades of use in the corporate sector, dashboards started gaining momentum in health care recently, mostly for organizational management and health system performance assessment. In early 2020, publicly available (and internal) COVID-19 dashboards were rapidly launched worldwide to communicate pandemic-related information to the public and to be used as decision-making aid for governments and public health authorities. The speed and uniformity at which countries worldwide embraced dashboards as a reporting and decision-making modality was unprecedented. 
Our global research team of health system and service researchers studied the phenomena from different perspectives during 2020 and 2021. We looked at (1) what makes COVID-19 dashboards actionable, on a global sample of 158 dashboards from 53 countries; (2) how dashboards change, on examples of Canada and the Netherlands; and (3) how can the development process of COVID-19 dashboards be described from the perspective of their governmentally-appointed developers, on a sample of 33 WHO European region countries. Through our research we have (1) identified seven features common to actionable dashboards worldwide; (2) mapped areas of dashboard improvements; and (3) documented common barriers, enablers and lessons derived from the experiences of dashboard developers. 
Findings from our series of COVID-19 dashboard-related research work provide interesting insights on governmental use of digital tools, such as dashboards, for managing the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond. The ubiquitous use of dashboards by governments, for reporting to the public and supporting internal decision-making, was mostly based on an international ripple effect, rather than the activation of pre-existing emergency response plans. The uptake of dashboards appears triggered by early adopters and sustained by a proactive commercial software vendor market. This often meant launching data-rich dashboards but with suboptimally defined purpose and target audience and little attention paid to providing easy-to-understand information, including relevant and meaningful disaggregation and geographical details. 
An interesting finding is also the motivation, competence and readiness to help from non-governmental players - academics, NGOs, IT, media sector – which heavily influenced data dashboard landscape during the pandemic. This especially holds true for dashboard software vendors and their role in the process. Dashboards feed on relevant, accurate and timely data, which most national health information systems initially struggled to provide accurate. Our findings signal the need for continued investment in national-level data sources that are integrated and interoperable, and digital infrastructure that spans secondary, primary and social care systems. Dashboards are an important communication tool but, like other digital technologies, they are no silver bullet. Features of dashboards must fit with their intended purposes, while the actionability of data for its end users relies on the extent to which the information is communicated clearly and understood. Governments need to consider systematic approaches to exploring user needs and use patterns, in order to help dashboards bridge the gap between being a managerial tool and a public reporting device.",University of Amsterdam,University of Amsterdam,,,,,,,University of Amsterdam,,Damir Ivankovic,Erica Barbazza,,,,,,,Damir Ivankovic,,Institutions,Knowledge,International,Communication,Decision Making,Technology,,,Governments and the use of data dashboards to communicate to the public and support decision-making: A case of COVID-19 dashboards and a way forward,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65800&EventID=185
0,"The paper investigates the specificity of regional leadership in political system of Russia.
Regional leaders and current governors have found themselves in a rather complex system of inter-institutional relations. On the one hand, representatives of the regional elite must effectively solve the economic problems facing the region, ensure the implementation of federal programs, sometimes with substantially reduced funding, to participate in elections and be guided by the opinion of voters, but at the same time, the elite must show complete loyalty to the Center and should not exceed the permitted limits. Such situation leads to obvious political atrophy of leadership in regions. Possible strong candidates do not want to get involved in the elections. As a result, the specific type of the regional leader - “faceless-leader” was formed.
The main focus of the paper is the difference between elected governors and appointed heads of regional executives in Russia. From 1991 to the present day, the role of the regional leader in the system of power relations has changed. Heads of administrations (governors) have gone from popularly elected leaders to controlled functionaries. In fact, this was facilitated by a number of institutional changes and political reforms undertaken over the past 30 years. We studied the official biographies of all heads of administrations of the Siberian regions from 1991 to 2021, in the period of the electoral cycles (1991 - 2005, 2013 - 2021) and the appointment cycles (from 2005 to 2012).

What is the difference between an elected leader and an appointed leader? Does the introduction of direct elections create a new type of Governor? Does the appointment of governors help to reduce the number of “unpredictable” risks in the regional management system?
Liberalization and subsequent democratization of the political regime in the post-Soviet Russia of the early 1990s radically changed the basic principles of organization of power and functioning of the system of management, that is, the party state based on the merging of power and property, absorption of society by power, and rigid ideological doctrine of the mobilization type gave up their place to new power regime. Elections as a channel of incorporation into the regional elite became a reality as a result of political reforms. In 2004, direct elections of governors were abolished, which significantly affected the process of forming the political elite in the regions, and also changed the status of the governor in the political system. The governor was appointed directly by the president on the recommendation of the local parliaments of the subjects. But the vertical alignment led to negative consequences - the system began to stagnate. Structural problems raised the question of changing the principles of forming the corps of heads of the subjects of the federation.",Novosibirsk State University,,,,,,,,Novosibirsk State University,,Nadezhda Ponomarenko,,,,,,,,Nadezhda Ponomarenko,,Democracy,Elites,Federalism,Regionalism,Power,,,,Governors in Multilevel States: from Leaders to Functionaries,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64847&EventID=185
0,"This article investigates how the idea of European solidarity and the vision of Europe changed over time amongst Italian groups and individuals engaged in solidarity actions in support of Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) and refugees in the Western Balkans in the 1990s and 2020s. By means of document analysis and in-depth qualitative interviews, it shows that individuals partaking in solidarity initiatives framed their action as European grassroots solidarity, enacted to replace the institutional solidarity that the EU failed to offer to the Western Balkans. While solidarity groups in the 1990s were informed by an idea of Europe imbued with hope and trust in the role of the would-be EU and the process of EU integration, those mobilising in the 2020s expressed a more critical and disenchanted vision informed by rage, disillusionment, and disappointment towards an EU perceived as having betrayed its ideal foundations while dealing with migration on the Balkan route.",OBC Transeuropa,Scuola Normale Superiore,,,,,,,OBC Transeuropa,,Luisa Chiodi,Chiara Milan,,,,,,,Luisa Chiodi,,Civil Society,European Union,Peace,Solidarity,Refugee,,,,Grassroots European solidarity.

0,"In the face of cascading environmental disasters, a green agenda has become an ideological backbone of the European Union’s governance. However, within the wider green discourse in the EU, critical research describes the EU’s agenda and its dominant narratives as contradictory and infeasible at large. For example, the latest climate neutrality narrative is presented by the European Commission as transformational but seems to be perpetuating the already established principles of ecological modernisation. Despite the presence of other narratives, what mechanisms legitimize climate neutrality and, by extension, the EU’s green agenda? This article argues that the persistence of dominant narratives within the green agenda is legitimized by their affective dimension. This article describes the dominant narratives within the green agenda, puts them in the context of the wider green discourse in Europe, and uses the conceptual toolkit of Critical Fantasy Studies to identify and interpret the major fantasies that legitimize the climate neutrality narrative. An analysis of the European Commission’s public communication, specifically social media content, revealed five major fantasies: a fantasy of competency and preparedness, a fantasy of a scientific fix, a fantasy of green European citizenship, a fantasy of Europe's nature, and a fantasy of the EU as a global green leader. It is argued that these fantasies provide two major anchor points for affective investment: they satisfy the public demand for a transformative change in the context of the so-called climate anxiety through shaping a new climate-centred narrative but continue offering familiar technological and economic solutions. In contrast to techno-managerial analysis of the EU’s green policies and towards a holistic approach that incorporates discourse-oriented research, this article suggests that thinking about policy agendas ‘fantasmatically’ is useful to understand why problematic policies persist.",Metropolitan University Prague,,,,,,,,Metropolitan University Prague,,Oleksandra Kovalevska,,,,,,,,Oleksandra Kovalevska,,Environmental Policy,European Union,Green Politics,International Relations,Post-Structuralism,Agenda-Setting,Climate Change,,"Green is the new black: the European Union’s green agenda, its narratives, and the fantasies that animate them",https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63504&EventID=185
0,"While recent research has analysed the emergence of environmental populism in different contexts (Bosworth 2020 ; Koutnik 2020) or examined the greening of European radical left parties (Wang & Keith 2020), little work has empirically analysed the place of environmentalism and climate issues in the narratives and agendas of left-wing populist parties. We propose to follow this avenue through a case study of Jean-Luc Mélenchon’s movement, La France Insoumise (LFI, Unbowed France), a left-wing populist movement that has embraced climate challenges. We are especially interested in the relationship between populism and environmentalism in LFI’s discourse to understand to what extent it can be considered as a ‘green populism’. We rely on different sources of data (leaders’ writings, party manifestos, semi- structured interviews with activists) and perform qualitative and quantitative text analyses of leaders and activists’ discourses (NVivo and Iramuteq). We first show that environmentalism is an inseparable element of LFI’s genesis: the early greening of the leaders’ narrative is in line with a process of dissociation from the Socialist Party and emancipation from the French Communist Party’s productivist matrix. We then analyse the climate agenda of LFI and find that the party has set the ‘ecological bifurcation’ as one of its priorities in the 2017 and 2022 presidential elections with the aim of dissociating itself from the Green Party (Europe Ecologie - Les Verts) by advocating a ‘popular ecology’. We show that environmentalism thus participates in the construction of the ‘people’ mobilised by LFI through its association with popular sovereignty, its anti-oligarchic framing and a theorisation of the 'human people’. Finally, we show that LFI’s activists, some of whom are fully involved in environmental mobilisations, mostly share the party's climate agenda, although some of them draw an opposition between the ‘ecological question’ and the ‘popular question’ symbolised, for instance, by the surge of the Yellow Vests.",Universidad Complutense de Madrid,Institut d'Études Politiques de Rennes I,,,,,,,Universidad Complutense de Madrid,,Laura Chazel,Vincent Dain,,,,,,,Laura Chazel,,Environmental Policy,Political Parties,Populism,Campaign,,,,,Greener than the Greens?

0,"In this article we undertake an empirical examination of the psychology of what is often called ‘the angry citizen’, focusing on the emotional mechanism of ressentiment. A key element of the ‘anti-social triad of grievance politics’ (Capelos et al., 2021), ressentiment transmutes grievances felt as deprivation of opportunity, injustice, humiliation, lack of political efficacy, to emotional expressions of socially righteous indignation, destructive anger, hatred and rage. Focusing on anger as the output of negative politics can obfuscate the complex psychological footprint of ressentiment. To highlight the important differences between anger-proper and ressentiment, we use an original dataset with 164 excerpts from interviews with US ‘angry’ citizens available in Angry White Men: American Masculinity at the End of an Era by Michael Kimmel, Strangers in their Own Land by Arlie Russell Hochschild and Stiffed: The Roots of Modern Male Rage by Susan Faludi. Employing qualitative and quantitative content analysis of the ‘angry citizens’ excerpts, we find evidence of envy, shame and inefficacious anger which fit the psychological footprint of ressentiment. Moreover, excerpts scoring high on ressentiment contain high frequency of reactionary anti-preferences and collective narcissism, pointing to the close relationship between the elements of the ‘anti-social triad of grievance politics’. This article engages with contemporary debates on negative politics, advances our theoretical understanding of the psychology of anger, and highlights the role of ressentiment as the emotional mechanism of grievance politics.

0,"In 2014, just over five years after the Returns Directive was adopted, the strategic policy goal to “restore the credibility of the EU returns system” started being repeated like a mantra in policy documents and European Council discussions. A shift involved member states pushing back against limited human rights safeguards included in the Directive (2008/115/EC) at the behest of the European Parliament in exchange for providing an EU legal basis to national detention and deportation practices which had become routine. Using bulk numbers to present migrants staying irregularly in EU territory as an existential “problem” to be solved with the utmost urgency and without paying much attention to legal niceties, this outlook heralded an onslaught against the human rights of people on the move. The European Agenda on Migration and the hotspot approach deployed in Italy and Greece from 2015, as well as the 2020 Pact on Immigration and Asylum that is under discussion, all sought to subordinate normative frameworks to the “effective” pursuit of this strategic goal. From 2015 to 2022, Frontex, the Commission and member states have pushed an agenda to reframe human rights as a “problem” that limits the attainment of strategic policy goals, including large-scale “returns”. 
Building on this overall scenario, the present contribution will use Bob Jessop’s strategic relational approach (SRA) to state power to investigate what positive values, human rights principles and legal precepts must be undermined to achieve the goal of “restoring the credibility of the EU returns system”.

The paradigm of symbolic interactionism conceives of communication as a production of meaning within a symbolic universe, so the use of the words are as well. New words appear and words disappear in the communication as long as they help us to refer something that we want to express, so they are spread when they get importance in the society. That's why new words are key for studying the society as they express new phenomenons. Approaching the way they spread would be an interesting tool for understanding better these new phenomenons and the importance they have in society.
With this goal during this work it is tried to approach this way of spreading by means of its analysis in social networks. Social networks are not a representation of actual life socialization. Nowadays it represents a new way of socialization with it owns behavior; but fully interdependent with real life and sharing a lot of dynamics with it. Knowing this, studying the spread of new terms in twitter will helps us to know the expression of new social realities that take importance in our realities and the way they are expressed, and by this way we can also approach this new social realities in the hole social life.
Twitter as the predilect social network for network analysis, and more when talking about text, is chosen for this investigation. As the study of just appeared words would be hard as its difficult to find these words that have to be completely new, hastags are ideal for this analysis, as they are also used for expressing social realities that get importance in the community. By different data science tools as network analysis, twitter api, web scrapping… in this project it is tried to build a method for analyzing this spreading of terms on twitter. This will be based on the capture of tweets with new hastags, the building of friendship networks in between the authors of these tweets and the visualization of the spreading in this networks. By means of this method it will be possible to analyze this spreading for different new words or hastags using different indicators and visualizations that will allow us to approach the different ways of spreading of the new concepts in twitter.",Universidad Complutense de Madrid,,,,,,,,Universidad Complutense de Madrid,,Alejandro Echaniz Jimenez,,,,,,,,Alejandro Echaniz Jimenez,,Social Movements,Analytic,Broadcast,Constructivism,Technology,Big Data,Empirical,,Hastags spreading analysis on social networks: a method for aproaching how new concepts spread in social networks.,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63454&EventID=185
0,"Evidence of an increasing hostility towards partisan out-groups, also labelled affective polarization, has grown in recent years, as have studies examining its potential roots and consequences (Iyengar et al., 2019). Although mostly focused on the US bipartisan context, a growing body of literature finds that sustaining negative misperceptions of the out-group, as well as a growing feeling of anger towards the out-party, are greater predictors of affective polarization towards out-party supporters than party identification, partisanship, or issue position (Garrett & Bankert, 2018). Moreover, recent studies suggest that political campaigns, and negative advertising in particular, may fuel affective polarization, because of the constant portrayal of out-groups as a threat, the exaggeration of perceived tensions between parties, and the consistent emphasis on political partisanship (Michelitch & Utych, n.d.; Sood & Iyengar, 2016). We build on these findings by examining the role of negative appeals in elite communications on affective polarization outside of campaign periods in multiparty systems.  

Theoretically, we draw from the mechanism of affective learning to examine if exposure to a negative appeal from an in-party politician towards the out-party increases one’s negative feelings towards supporters of this out-party. We also explore whether this effect is stronger or weaker when the targeted out-group is of moderate or extreme distance from the in-party on the political spectrum. Additionally, we draw from the theory of elite position adoption to test whether different types of attacks (issue based or ad hominem), different degrees of incivility, and different issue mentions in these appeals have differential effects on affective polarization. 

To analyse the relationship between political attacks and affective polarization, we conducted an online survey experiment in Flanders (Belgium) in the fall of 2021 (n=2.547). We find that those exposed to a negative appeal scored consistently higher on both measures of affective polarization compared to the control group. However, the regression analyses testing the effects of being exposed to a civil versus an uncivil attack, or a personal versus an issue attack, or a moderate out-party versus extreme out-party attack on affective polarisation, did not show any statistical differences. Finally, the effect of being exposed to an attack on affective polarization was stronger among those exposed to an attack targeting an extreme out-party compared to those exposed to an attack targeting a moderate out-party. 

These findings advance the current literature by uncovering effects of negative appeals in politicians’ communication and political attacks on affective polarization outside of campaigning periods. This study shows that negative elite communications could be another driver of affective polarization regardless of the degree of incivility or the topic of the attack, which has several implications for political communication research: most importantly, it confirms and stresses that the use of negative campaigning tactics in elite communications play a role in the erosion of social cohesion, everyday interactions, and relationships. Second, our findings suggest that, in multiparty systems, affective polarization is not only omnipresent on the political spectrum but can also occur between partisans of moderately distanced parties, and therefore of moderately distanced ideologies.",Universiteit Antwerpen,,,,,,,,Universiteit Antwerpen,,Artemis Tsoulou-Malakoudi,,,,,,,,Artemis Tsoulou-Malakoudi,,Citizenship,Elites,Political Violence,Communication,,,,,Hate thy neighbor like my party does?

0,"Although scientific consensus exists about the importance of guaranteeing appropriate healthcare to all migrants, those with precarious legal status are often displaced to the margins of national healthcare systems. Nevertheless, while governments have the power to define the – often limited – entitlements to healthcare for migrants with precarious legal status, the responsibility of drawing the line between those who deserve access to scarce resources and those who do not is in the hands of street-level bureaucrats operating at the front-line of healthcare systems. Linking the nascent literature on healthcare deservingness to the street-level bureaucracy perspective in policy analysis, the paper analyses how assessments of healthcare deservingness are constructed on the front-line of healthcare systems, and how these perceptions may turn into discretionary practices of in/exclusion. It presents a comparative ethnographic study carried out between 2014 and 2017 in three Italian public health structures providing primary care to migrants with precarious legal statuses (undocumented migrants, EU migrants without formal residence rights, pending asylum seekers). The study points out how opposing practices of inclusion towards ‘vulnerable patients’ or exclusion towards ‘fraudsters’ and ‘clandestini’ derived from workers’ views about migrants’ ‘illegality’ (control, reciprocity and attitudes criteria of deservingness), and the ways street-level bureaucrats interpreted their own role in the system, regardless of their formal professional responsibility (administrative workers and doctors).",Universidad Complutense de Madrid,,,,,,,,Universidad Complutense de Madrid,,Roberta Perna,,,,,,,,Roberta Perna,,Local Government,Public Policy,Immigration,Qualitative,Asylum,Narratives,,,Healthcare deservingness at the front-line.

It seeks to understand how national myths can be read through the lens of Lacanian psychoanalysis, by contrasting myths with concepts like history, memory, and the past.

We investigate the shift of these mythscapes in religious and political discourses. Thereby, the research brings more clarity into the field of memory studies and memory politics.  
This study utilizes discourse theoretical analysis to comparatively analyze press releases and YouTube videos of the Orthodox Churches and right-wing parties who articulate myth-laden discourses. There are two preliminary findings. First, both Churches rely on downplaying the objectivity of history that separated Moldova and Kosovo from their respective nations. Oppositely, both churches accentuate the re-articulation of fantasies and the material symbolism that revives the ethnoscape tied to the national myth. Second, the Churches’ discourses are developed by right-wing parties (e.g., Serbian Progressive Party and the Alliance for the Union of Romanians) in political and PR campaigns that combine religious iconography and mythological symbols that narrate and validate belonging, both in terms of history and territory.",University of Helsinki,University of Helsinki,,,,,,,University of Helsinki,,Ionut Chiruta,Marina Vulovic,,,,,,,Ionut Chiruta,,Europe (Central and Eastern),National Identity,Nationalism,Constructivism,Comparative Perspective,Narratives,,,Hegemonic Re-articulations of National Myths in Romania and Serbia,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64761&EventID=185

Conditional grant programs are widely used in federal systems to address the tension between decentralized policy provision and macroeconomic constraints on constituent units’ ability to raise revenues and territorial equity. While enhancing their financial capacity, conditional grants are often seen as reducing constituent units’ policy autonomy. Against this backdrop, this article examines the real impact conditional grants have on the capacity and autonomy of a constituent unit. We analyze key milestones in the genesis and evolution of conditional grant programs in education and healthcare in Australia, Canada, and the United States. We find that the impact of conditional grants depends on constituent units’ size, fiscal capacity, and distinctiveness. Conditional grants are most beneficial to smaller and/or fiscally weaker constituent units but highly distinctive units suffer the most significant autonomy losses. If carefully designed, conditional grant programs thus have the potential to play a positive role in addressing spatial inequalities in multilevel systems.",University of Kent,Freie Universität Berlin,,,,,,,Freie Universität Berlin,,Paolo Dardanelli,Johanna Schnabel,,,,,,,Johanna Schnabel,,Comparative Politics,Federalism,Public Policy,USA,Qualitative Comparative Analysis,Education,,,"Helping Hand or Centralizing Tool?

0,"In contrast to the continuous advancements towards gender equality in political participation and political representation, the gender gap in political interest remains largely unchanged: In almost every European country, women are less likely to express interest in (national) politics than men, with a large share of women describing themselves as entirely disinterested. Given the importance of political interest for political knowledge, involvement, and—through its impact on engagement in parties—women’s descriptive and substantive representation, the implications of the persistence of the gender gap are troubling. Yet, not all gender gaps are the same: While present in almost all countries and across different political systems, they differ substantially in size, indicating that, in addition to individual-level predictors, societal and political context also plays a role. 
However, research has only recently started to explore the role of social and political context for women’s political interest. Recent studies have documented the importance of overall levels of gender equality, as higher scores on the Gender Equality Index (GEI)—summarising equality across domains such as employment, health, and politics—are associated with smaller gender gaps in political interest. It remains unclear, however, which elements specifically make more equal societies conducive to women’s political interest. Building on the literature on political participation, it is plausible that the gender composition of the public sphere is important. When women see other women in positions of political or economic power, they are less likely to perceive politics as a men’s domain.
In this paper, I argue that for the same reason, gender norms and stereotypes about women in politics should also matter: according to traditional gender roles, women are expected to focus on private life and the family while leaving politics (and interest in politics) to men. Consequently, in societies where strong traditional gender norms prevail, we should expect women’s interest in politics to be, on average, lower and the gender gap larger. However, few studies have examined this association between gender norms on the societal level and political interest empirically.  
This study examines the impact of gender norms on women’s and men’s political interest, using data from 36 countries included in the fifth round of the European Value Study (2017) combined with detailed (aggregated) data on gender norms. Controlling for traditional individual-level predictors, it focuses, first, on the impact of general and domain-specific (politics) gender norms on both, men’s and women’s political interest and tests if the effect of these norms is mediated through or moderated by individual gender-role attitudes. Second, it explores the homogeneity of the influence of gender norms across different groups of women, arguing that their impact is determined by women’s individual characteristics and life situations. By closely examining the impact of gender norms on political interest, this paper contributes to our understanding of contextual influences on political interest—while offering a grim prediction about the closing of the gender gap: Given the persistence of traditional gender norms, the gender gap in political interest seems to be also here to stay.",Universität Salzburg,,,,,,,,Universität Salzburg,,Nadine Zwiener-Collins,,,,,,,,Nadine Zwiener-Collins,,Gender,Political Psychology,Political Sociology,Comparative Perspective,Empirical,Political Cultures,,,Here to stay?

0,"The internationalization of higher education (HE) has been one of the most notable developments in the HE sector in the last decades, characterized, most prominently, by a steady rise of internationally mobile students until 2019 (OECD, 2021). The European Union (EU) has promoted HE internationalization through policies such as the Erasmus Scheme or the Bologna Process (Dadowska, 2019). The proliferation of internationalization strategies on national and organizational levels of HE governance further underlines the extent to which the international dimension has become institutionalized across European HE systems (Crăciun, 2018). Recent years, however, brought about two major disruptions to longstanding HE policies and decades of European HE integration: the United Kingdom’s 2016 decision to leave the EU and the Covid-19 pandemic, which began affecting European HE in early 2020. Both Brexit and the Corona crisis have been widely discussed as potential critical junctures that may or may not lead HE internationalization onto a new developmental path (e.g. Altbach & de Wit, 2020). But how have the two disruptions actually affected HE systems and to what extent do policy responses vary across countries? Can Brexit and the pandemic be characterized as potential critical junctures? 
The paper presents findings from a comparative study on HE internationalization policies in England, France, and Germany, the three most internationalized countries in terms of student mobility flows, with a focus on Brexit and Covid-19 responses between 2016 and 2021. Drawing on historical and sociological institutionalism (Capoccia, 2015; Hall, 1993; Hogan et al., 2022; Mahoney & Thelen, 2010; Scott, 2008), and a qualitative content analysis of 44 expert interviews and policy documents, the study’s findings indicate that rather than triggering sudden path departure and sweeping ideational change, both disruptions intensified existing institutional tensions and accelerated ongoing policy developments. From an English perspective, Brexit induced regulative and normative changes, which reflected perennial competing cultural-cognitive logics with regards to the overall rationales of HE internationalization. In France and Germany, Brexit strengthened the normative and cultural-cognitive commitment to the European project.
Covid-19 responses highly depended on the respective national contexts, especially existing digital infrastructures. The pandemic was less of a disruption for the already more digitalized internationalization of English HE, whereas in France and Germany, Covid-19 served as a regulative and normative path clearer, accelerating previously languishing policy initiatives surrounding the digitalization of HE internationalization, however with different policy foci.
The paper contributes empirically to the literature on HE internationalization by analyzing recent policy developments in a comparative perspective.

0,"Interest intermediation in higher education, as in other parts of the public sector, is clearly a complex multi-level phenomenon, comprising two related developments. One, decision-makers at lower governance levels often engage in uploading or downloading policy preferences, and such (often strategic) behaviour implies that decisions at one level influence and are influenced by decisions taken at other levels of governance. Two, organizations representing various interests take advantage of this multi-level context and engage in venue- and level-shopping, organize into associations or build advocacy coalitions to strengthen their lobbying power. Taken together, these two developments mean that the national level interest groups operate in a multi-level environment.
This study takes this multi-level characteristic of the organizational environment as its point of departure and, by focusing on national level student unions, explores national and European level antecedents of organizational homo-/heterogeneity of interest groups and discusses the implications for national and European level interest intermediation. 
The study first maps characteristics of organizations representing the interests of students in 44 European countries – specifically formal organizational structure, organizational image, and breadth of policy agenda – and based on that assesses the extent of organizational homogeneity/heterogeneity. Based on insights from interest groups and organization theory literature, the analysis then explores to what extent this can be accounted for by: (a) characteristics of their national interest intermediation contexts, specifically intensity of competition for members and resources, relationship with the state (recognition, funding), relationship with other national level actors and recent policy changes that concern higher education governance arrangements, and (b) European dynamics, specifically membership in European level associations and advocacy coalitions, as well as European level policy developments concerning higher education governance.

0,"Deliberative mini-publics have been considered as a potential way to enhance consideration of the future and promote future-oriented thinking. Still, thinking about the future can be hard, because of the negative emotions such as stress and anxiety it can evoke. This article explores whether and to what extent deliberative mini-publics can help thinking about the future by invoking positive emotions, like hopefulness and enthusiasm. We analyze an online mini-public held in the region of Satakunta, Finland, which was organized to involve the public in the drafting process of a regional plan, extending to the year 2050. In addition to the standard practices of mini-publics, half of the small groups taking part in the Satakunta Citizens’ Assembly carried out a special imaginary time travel exercise, a so-called Future Design. The analysis makes use of both survey and qualitative data. Based on the surveys, we find that after democratic deliberation positive emotions like hopefulness and compassion increased, and negative emotions related to the future were reduced. Most notably, as a result of deliberation people became less fearful and confused about the future. There are, however, notable differences in how emotions developed in different small groups. Transcripts of the deliberations and participants’ interviews shed further light into how participants felt during the event and how their sentiments concerning the future changed.

However, First Minister Questions (FMQs) in devolved administrations, such as Wales and Scotland, have yet to be systematically investigated to the same extent. This research project focuses on comparative levels of hostility between: a) the Scottish First Minister and the Conservative leader in the Scottish Parliament; and b) the Prime Minister and the leader of the SNP in Westminster. To date, it has been unclear whether the divergent institutional and political contexts have an impact upon the level of hostility during those question times.  We analysed exchanges using transcripts of ten sessions of each, PMQs and FMQs, before and ten sessions during the COVID outbreak to see whether the pandemic had a similar impact on both exchanges. For this, we applied and adjusted a coding schedule derived from Waddle, Bull and Böhnke (2019). Our findings indicate that exchanges in FMQs are less hostile and that the COVID outbreak impacted exchanges in Westminster differently than in Holyrood. While both exchanges were significantly less aggressive during COVID, the magnitude of the lack of hostility is still noticeably different in the Scottish Parliament. The results of this study are useful for three main reasons: 1) they address in part a gap in the literature on FMQs; 2) the comparative nature of the research contributes to the debate on whether politics at Holyrood is more consensual; and 3) the pre and post design permits a comparative assessment of the impact of crises upon legislative behaviour.",University of Stirling,University of Strathclyde,,,,,,,University of Stirling,,Sebastian Ludwicki-Ziegler,Mark Shephard,,,,,,,Sebastian Ludwicki-Ziegler,,Comparative Politics,Parliaments,Political Competition,Representation,Qualitative Comparative Analysis,Domestic Politics,,,Hostile or Consensual?: A Comparative Study of Personal Attacks and Positive Self-Reference in Exchanges between the Conservatives and SNP in PMQs and FMQs,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65791&EventID=185
0,"Polarisation has enjoyed much public and academic attention in recent years. However, a clear definition or conceptualization is lacking despite its growing importance in public and academic debates and its potentially major effects on the stability and health of our democracies. Even more so, multiple understandings trouble an operationalizable understanding that would enhance empirical research. As polarisation has been studied from different substantive and analytical perspectives, approaches, and traditions, its meaning and hence operability in empirical research have been significantly clouded. This paper, aiming to disentangle the various meanings of polarisation from the cobweb of current understandings, has therefore systematically mapped existing literature about polarisation within the social sciences. It has analysed various definitions of the concept (N = 223) through 1) a novel conceptual framework of six categories that emerged from the coding process, and 2) a resulting novel classification of six theoretical types of polarisation. On the basis thereof, if found that polarisation (in this sample) is a form of increasing distance between actors in three possible ‘modes’ (active conflict, affective change, structural change) and that this distance results from 1) a direct confrontation over a specific conflict about certain ideas and/or identities; 2) occurs on a certain distribution of society and/or politics; or 3) deals with conflicting ways to perceive or construct reality. Ultimately, an analysis of the co-occurrence of the various codes that have been assigned to the definitions reveals two major ideal types of polarisation: cold polarisation, which is a form of structural distance between individuals or elites over general ideas or the general distribution of society; and hot polarisation, in which groups become distant from each other based on their identities and/or how they perceive reality in general. These findings hope to contribute to a more nuanced conceptual framework of polarisation that can be used for further empirical research on the topic.",Vrije Universiteit Brussel,,,,,,,,Vrije Universiteit Brussel,,Kamil Bernaerts,,,,,,,,Kamil Bernaerts,,Conflict,Contentious Politics,Democracy,Extremism,,,,,Hot or cold?

0,"More voters in the UK now identify as Leaver or Remainer than with one of its political parties. The conflict over the British membership in the EU created a division that cuts across party lines several years after the EU referendum. Do these new political identities generate prejudice akin to party identities? And to what extent to these identities create bias when it comes to violations of civil liberties in the UK? To answer these questions, we test a set of hypotheses derived from a typology of prejudice developed by Allport (1954). The first study was conducted in 2019, i.e. three years after the Brexit referendum. We test a set of six pre-registered online survey experiments with a diverse (non-student) sample of more than 900 respondents recruited on Prolific Academic. The results show that Brexit identities are at least as important for political behaviour as party identities. Moreover, we find that Brexit identities bias citizens’ judgments when it comes to violations of democratic norm. Voters are more forgiving of democratic norm violations (corruption, hateful speech) when conducted by their Brexit in-group and they punish the same violations more harshly when conducted by their Brexit out-group (i.e. by people who do not share their views). We also find that voters discriminate against their Brexit out-group in non-political situations. The second study tests the same hypotheses with equivalent online experiments in the Spring of 2022. We discuss the findings in light of the debate on the disruptive role of affective polarisation and how its behavioural implications cause problems for the functioning of liberal democracies.",University of Exeter,,,,,,,,University of Exeter,,Florian Stoeckel,,,,,,,,Florian Stoeckel,,Democracy,European Politics,European Union,Identity,Euroscepticism,Experimental Design,Survey Experiments,Brexit,How Affective Polarization Based on Brexit Identities Biases Citizens When Democratic Norms Are Violated,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65608&EventID=185
0,"The question of how and why policies succeed or fail is key for the study of public policy. Over the past decade, the policy success framework proposed by Allan McConnell and colleagues has become a widely used reference for scholars to evaluate policy success and failure. However, there is to date no systematic assessment of the usefulness of the framework to conceptualize and measure policy success and failure, and of what factors explain these outcomes. This paper conducts the first systematic review of the empirical research applying McConnell’s policy success framework since its publication in 2010. The goal of this study is three-fold: first, we identify how scholars conceptualize and operationalize policy success and failure in different policy domains at levels of policy outputs, outcomes, or impacts, along with the procedural, programmatic, and political dimensions. Second, we provide a comprehensive overview of arguments and findings regarding the factors and underlying working mechanisms that explain why policies succeed or fail on different dimensions, at different stages, and in different sectors. Third, we examine the policy success framework against standard criteria for judging the strength of concepts (e.g., familiarity, coherence, differentiation, depth, and utility) in the application in empirical research. The findings provide important insights into the usefulness, limitations, and possible improvements of the policy success framework, the findings it has helped produce so far, and areas for future research.",Universität Konstanz,Universität Konstanz,,,,,,,Universität Konstanz,,Eva Thomann,Jieqiong Wu,,,,,,,Jieqiong Wu,,Policy Analysis,Public Administration,Public Policy,,,,,,How and why do policies succeed or fail?

We argue that research on the social contruction of target populations might fill this gap. While it is crucial to understand how target group constructions are being made, the exact criteria along which these constructions operate have not yet been well understood. This is especially the case when we extend the view beyond the field of redistributive policies and their focus on granting (or not) different (social) rights, for which a rather independent line on ‘deservingness criteria’ and solidarity norms has been developed. Yet for other policy areas, different constructions may gain importance, which, for instance, portray characters as ‘honest’, ‘criminal’, ‘caring’, or ‘selfish’. This paper aims to identify and systematise these constructions and their operating criteria, with the aim to improve our understanding of characters in policy narratives. Empirically, the paper analyses policy measures that have been enacted in the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany. While the pandemic clearly represents an exceptional case, it nevertheless provides ample evidence of how different characters are being portrayed in policy narratives.",FernUniversität in Hagen,Universität Bremen,,,,,,,Universität Bremen,,Sonja Blum,Johanna Kuhlmann,,,,,,,Johanna Kuhlmann,,Policy Analysis,Public Policy,Regulation,Narratives,,,,,How are characters constructed in policy narratives?

0,"Citizen participation is a deeply emotional affair because it commonly involves deeply felt concerns and beliefs, and interaction between individuals (e.g. Verhoeven and Duyvendak 2015). Although attention to the affective dimension of citizen participation is increasing (e.g. Eshuis et al 2014; Van ‘t Wout et al 2010; Weber 2012), citizens’ emotions in participatory processes are still understudied; knowledge lacks on how citizens deal with emotions and how that effects participation. Literature on citizen participation is dominated by a rationalist approach in which emotions are often neglected. This research aims to explain how citizens deal with emotions, and how this impacts citizen participation. The study uses a survey among citizens in 4 cases of real estate development (in the USA and the Netherlands) that feature various forms of citizen participation such as deliberative meetings, petitions, and direct contact between individual citizens and politicians. The cases have aroused negative emotions among residents, who for example fear more car traffic. The research addresses whether citizens who are successful in regulating their emotions, have less strong emotions, which in turn diminishes their motivation to engage and ultimately results in lower levels of citizen participation. Studies have shown that emotion regulation through cognitive reappraisal decreases negative emotions, while expression suppression decreases positive and increases negative emotion experience (Gross et al 2013). Ford et al (2019) have shown that successful cognitive reappraisal of emotions, leads to less intense emotions and in turn decreases political participation. Barnes (2008) explains that suppression of emotions inhibits engagement with the emotional content of what is discussed, and this inhibits deliberation and citizens’ engagement. Reappraisal helps people to reflect and engage emotionally with a topic, and this facilitates deliberation (Davies et al 2006). The survey measures emotion regulation through acceptance, reappraisal, suppression and situation selection.

0,"The Covid crisis reminds us of the need for participation in public space as democratic principle and also adds complex new twists to this 'right to the city'. Urban scholars and activists have advanced a wide spectrum of norms, claims and movements for economic, cultural or political justice against inequalities, exclusion and privatization of public space. Covid not only highlights again the problems and opportunities of cities, their differentiated local contexts and complex global interconnectedness but the measures also imply farreaching restrictions of public space. The state thus appears to be taking back control of public life, while reenforcing tendencies toward retreat to privacy by new appeals to social solidarity based in physical distance. Whereas previously the critical urban concern was directed against neoliberal market forces decreasing public autority, now the right to the city may be invoked to protect democratic rule against authoritarian shifts and deepening inequalities. However, with Covid protesters taking the streets of cities and populist politicians seizing the public debate, the initially progressive notion is now claimed and reinterpreted by a movement that is dominated by right nationalists. Although everyday life in cities still challenges average citizens' to develop diverse creative coping practices, the urban notion is at risk of losing its critical potential for addressing the social consenquences of differentiated affecteness. Yet, for example, in the case of Vienna's municipal elections, otherwise local matters of technocratic urban planning have gained importance for public politics at a national level, thus increasing awareness of the democratic functions of urban space. The various mutually interacting pro- and anti-urban claims also highlighted the multifacetted functions of public space for democratic crisis management, so that urban diversity gained potential for turning polarisation into plural contentions. The new regulatory and social practices thus open a contentious field of claims-making which connect the specific places of everyday interactions with the public political sphere of democratic governance. To counter authoritarian and right-populist tendencies, this political mobilisation of the city constitutes the current moment as crucial for critical experts to contribute toward democratic deliberation in face of complex uncertainties.",University of Vienna,,,,,,,,University of Vienna,,Monika De Frantz,,,,,,,,Monika De Frantz,,Contentious Politics,Democratisation,Political Participation,Populism,Social Justice,Social Movements,Mobilisation,Political Activism,"How Covid Captures, or Repoliticizes the 'Right to the City'",https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=66072&EventID=185

By analysing the affordances offered by two widely used digital platforms – Facebook and NationBuilder – the chapter develops a new theoretical and empirical account of how digital technologies shape what it means to ‘join’ a political organisation in today’s society. It examines not only the potential of these digital platforms to facilitate the process of membership by, for example, increasing the ease of access to political organisations, but the broader potential of these technologies to respond to the expressive and social identity needs of citizens by forging collective communities through a mass of individualised actions (Bennett and Segerberg 2013).

0,"How does culture affect countries’ decisions to liberalize their financial sector? Although culture is receiving increasing attention from political economists, it is still largely absent in the financial liberalization literature. This study seeks to fill this gap by providing a novel theory of the cultural factors that shape policies of financial openness. I argue that cultural distance between countries and cultural homogeneity within countries can explain policymakers’ decisions regarding financial liberalization. Methodologically, this study offers innovative identification strategies for estimating the causal effect using genetic and pathogen factors as instrumental variables. Using dyadic and monadic panel data of 181 countries from 1970 to 2018, the analysis shows that culturally homogeneous countries tend to impose more capital controls and that culturally distant countries are less likely to integrate financially with each other. The mechanism behind this relationship is trust. In-group favoritism, which is reflected in a higher degree of trust among in-group members and a lower degree in out-group members, is greater in culturally homogeneous countries. Homogeneous societies are composed of strong close-knit networks that cultivate solidarity and trust among the society’s members through norms and values of cooperation and reciprocity. While any deviation from these norms would cost the member social sanctioning. In heterogeneous countries, kinship may be less critical for trust, as individuals encounter out-group members on a daily basis, and cooperating with them does not cause a severe social sanction. It follows that as the cultural distance between in-group and out-group members increases, the level of trust decreases. Hence, the less likely they are to integrate financially. The logic is that individuals and policymakers alike would prefer to conduct business with others who share their cultural traits since the financial market is highly trust-intensive (people exchange money for promises). These findings have implications for the debate over the heterogeneous pattern of financial reforms across countries and regions, which became the focus of attention of scholars after the negative effect of the 2008 global financial crisis and the current COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, this study helps understand the obstacles policymakers might encounter when adopting a financial liberalization policy in general, particularly those facing the internationalization of the Chinese currency. Since financial liberalization is essential to currency internationalization, culture provides an adequate explanation for the ongoing Chinese reluctance to free its capital account. Lastly, the proposed research argues that in-group favoritism also occurs in financial decision-making involving interactions with foreigners and that discrimination based on group identity can negatively impact both sides. Hence, understanding the roots of (un)cooperation is primarily significant.",Tel Aviv University,,,,,,,,Tel Aviv University,,GAL BITTON,,,,,,,,GAL BITTON,,China,Globalisation,Integration,National Identity,Political Economy,Political Psychology,Quantitative,Capitalism,How Does Culture Shape Financial Policies?

0,"Recent research has demonstrated that national and subnational policymaking in advanced democracies tends to respond unequally to the policy preferences of different actors and groups in society. However, little is known about whether similar biases characterize supranational policymaking in the European Union (EU) and, if so, under which conditions EU policymaking responds unequally to the preferences of different types of stakeholders (i.e., citizens and organized interests). This paper explores these questions by analyzing an original data set of 43 legislative proposals for which the European Commission (EC) organized one or several open public consultations among stakeholders prior to the formulation of the respective proposal. The data set reports for each policy alternative included in one of the public consultation surveys preceding a proposal (i) the level of support different stakeholder types expressed for the policy alternative and (ii) whether the policy alternative was included by the EC in the legislative proposal. The results of the analysis show whether and to what extent EC policymaking is unequally responsive to different stakeholders as well as the conditions under which unequal policy responsiveness may arise. These results are relevant to both researchers and practitioners since the EC has established one of the most comprehensive open public consultation regimes, with the aim to increase its input and output legitimacy by giving interested stakeholders greater opportunity to voice their preferences at relatively low cost in the policymaking process.",Universitetet i Bergen,,,,,,,,Universitetet i Bergen,,Reto Wüest,,,,,,,,Reto Wüest,,Democracy,European Politics,European Union,Interest Groups,Representation,Public Opinion,Policy-Making,,How Does Policymaking in the European Union Respond to Stakeholder Preferences?,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65551&EventID=185
0,"The purpose of this study is to examine how a platform business that does not hold a solid interest group can affect the government’s path-dependent regulatory policy preference through analyzing Uber cases in global major cities. The rise of what is referred to as the platform business disrupts the existing business, which causes conflict with the established interest groups. Here, the newly emerged platform business encounters the government’s path-dependent policy tendency formed by the long-term influence of the solid interest group of the existing market leaders. Accordingly, this study aims to find out which variables not only influenced the government's initial regulatory policy direction but also further make the government withhold its policy decisions. 
As one of the representatives of the platform business, Uber has undergone quite drastic conflicts with established taxi interest groups around the world when they unveiled their innovative service named UberPop – the cheapest service of Uber that connects passengers with unprofessional drivers. For Uber, the major conflict with the taxi drivers mainly emerged from the fact that it changed the range of service providers from licensed taxi drivers to unlicensed prosumers. As the unlicensed prosumers not only could threaten passengers but also with the strong push from the taxi drivers interest groups, most of the city governments responded to the initial situation by presenting regulatory possibilities for UberPop service.
Despite the organizational weaknesses to influence government regulations, however, Uber was able to overcome the challenges in some cities by forming a new type of interest group based on its prosumer and consumers. This study names this new type of interest group as the Invisible Interest Group(IIG) and argues it could affect the government’s regulatory decisions due to its unique characteristics. The IIG is the voluntarily assembled public – prosumers and consumers who used to be considered as the latent group(Olson, 1967)–, forming an ad-hoc interest group without any central organization nor closed membership. Since it is formed and performs its activities mainly online, the government can no longer preemptively acknowledge the IIG’s needs and level of political influence, but rather be forced to make the regulatory move first and respond to the IIG’s level of reaction towards it. Further, since the IIG tries to stop the government from forming a policy that they do not have a clear knowledge of its impact yet to prevent its potential expected loss, the emergence and the political influence of the IIG cannot be explained by the existing policy feedback theory(Schattschneider 1935, Pierson 1993, Lowi 1995) as well.
There still is, however, a question of when does the IIG success against both the established interest groups and path-dependent government? This study insists that the barometer for its success highly relies on its level of organizational power without an organization. More specifically, after the announcement of the policy direction, the government would measure IIG’s potential political influence through the IIG’s responsiveness – the number of voluntary participants and response time – to decide how to  react to the situation.",Seoul National University,,,,,,,,Seoul National University,,Chee Hae Chung,,,,,,,,Chee Hae Chung,,Interest Groups,Public Policy,Regulation,Business,Social Media,Technology,Policy-Making,,How does the new type of interest group affect the government’s regulatory process?: Case study on Uber in global major cities,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64462&EventID=185

The ideology underlying populist radical right parties is seen as challenging fundamental principles and norms of liberal and representative democracy. Yet, we still know little about the specific ideas that populist radical right party leaders and members hold about democracy. As politicians are also the main drivers in creating and communicating certain narratives and goals in democratic society, it is important to know what politicians actually think about democracy. Among these, the conception of democracy held by the leaders of the youth organization of radical right populist parties are especially revenant as they represent the future leaders and the party’s next generation. This proposed research paper therefore asks the following questions: What is the conception of democracy of the leaders of right-wing populist youth organizations and to what extent do they deviate from the normative ideal of liberal and representative democracy? In order to capture politicians’ understanding of democracy, the paper draws on an innovative method employing a vignette technique embedded in qualitative expert interviews. Thus, the proposed paper will rely on data gained from interviewing the leaders and executive members of the radical right populist youth organizations in Austria (Ring Freiheitlicher Jugend/RFJ) and Germany (Junge Alternative/JA) about their understanding of democracy.

0,"During the last two decades, a significant amount of political science research consistently problematised the phenomenon of partisanship and polarisation. Although that is the case, polarization is still a fuzzy one, and scholars frequently link the concept to other well-established political science concepts for creating a clearer picture. In that sense, partisanship is a frequently used one. Several studies claimed that recently partisanship has changed and developed into a specific type of social identity that shapes especially one specific type of polarisation, called as affective polarisation. Although we know that partisanship and affective polarisation research is on the rise, surprisingly, we have only scant knowledge about how it affects our policy choices. Motivated by this niche, this piece investigates a crucial dimension of this puzzle and displays how partisanship and affective polarisation shapes policy choices utilising the proposed policies related to the recent COVID-19 pandemic.
Such an effort is essential, at least for two reasons. First, by providing evidence about the power of affective polarisation on policy choices, it will be possible to comment on if and how citizen polarisation matters for politics. And second, it would be of great benefit to understand whether the political dispositions or the practical considerations influence policy preferences. 
Based on the arguments above, this paper analysed how partisanship and affective polarisation shapes the approval of policies related to COVID-19 by using a conjoint experiment that was fielded in a country representative face-to-face survey. The analysis separates two policy areas of elections and media freedom, referring to the conditions newly developed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The findings showed clear evidence on the fact that participants are more likely to approve policy proposals if their political party offers them. Moreover, regardless of party identifications, participants preferred policies that support media freedom. However, the picture is not that clear for the proposals which propose to postpone elections due to COVID-19.",Hacettepe University,,,,,,,,Hacettepe University,,Emre Toros,,,,,,,,Emre Toros,,Elections,Media,Causality,Electoral Behaviour,Experimental Design,Field Experiments,Voting Behaviour,Policy-Making,How Far Can Partisanship and Polarization Go?

The United States (US) has enjoyed the freedom to spread its western democracy and values worldwide, though not always very successfully. The world will soon become multipolar, or at least bipolar, and realism is likely to dominate the actions of the most powerful states. A likely strategy that Western states would use is to band together to resist the inevitable shift to a multipolar world. There will be a discussion about the geographical and historical significance of the Arctic.

0,"While the relevance of values and value orientations have for long been at the forefront of political sociology, Shalom Schwartz’ encompassing conceptualisation of basic human values and their interrelatedness has only recently started to inspire political science research. Recent empirical studies demonstrate, for instance, that some of Schwartz’ values are politically more consequential than others and that citizens are as much influenced by their value dispositions as are elected officials. To be sure, the extent to which human values will contribute to a better understanding of political involvement still needs to be explored. In this vein, this paper investigates the role a set of pre-selected human values, i.e. power, security, tradition and universalism, plays in voting for political parties along the ideological spectrum by combining the Manifesto Project’s content analysis of over 1’000 political party programmes with individual-level voting data from all nine waves of the European Social Survey. To advance this realm of research even further, we also examine the relevance of the re-emerging rural-urban divide in democratic societies and scrutinize, in particular, the manifold interactions between our set of human values and place of residence in a comparative perspective. At first, our comparative analyses with around 130’000 observations from 14 countries reveal a clear trend to vote for left-leaning parties in the aftermath of the financial and economic crisis with a right-wing uplift in 2018 and a tendency for rural areas to favour conservative parties. Second, human values depict only minor changes over time, yet are fairly differently distributed over urban and rural zones, with power and universalism showing the smallest and security and tradition demonstrating the largest differences across places of residence. Third, the analyses, which control for country- and time-fixed effects, strongly suggest the impact of place, with living in big cities and in the countryside on the opposite ends of the dependent variable, and human values with a particularly strong impact of universalism. Finally, the follow-up inspection of interaction effects provides a more nuanced picture which underlines the importance of place for human values to affect voting behaviour, yet simultaneously calls for caution not to embrace pre-emptively a seemingly simplistic rural-urban divide in this regard.",Universität Bern,Sciences Po Grenoble,,,,,,,Universität Bern,,Alina Zumbrunn,Sonja Zmerli,,,,,,,Alina Zumbrunn,,Cleavages,Political Psychology,Quantitative,Electoral Behaviour,,,,,How Human Values and the Rural-Urban Divide Interact to Shape Voting Behaviour,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65212&EventID=185

0,"Truth is a central concept in the pursuit of justice for Syrians. Many justice actors, or stakeholders who are involved in these justice efforts, have turned to the tools and rhetoric of transitional justice. In doing so, justice actors have been able to generate international attention for the plight of Syrian victims and counter the prevailing international defeatism about advancing justice when the conflict is ongoing. However, adopting the transitional justice toolkit in an atypical context such as Syria, contains several pitfalls such as an almost exclusive focus on criminal accountability. Furthermore, in the domain of truth-seeking, the dominant understanding tends to be rather narrowly defined as forensic or factual truth, to the detriment of other forms of truth. This paper examines the potential of informal truth practices like artistic practices and initiatives by victims groups to uncover victims’ realities and accommodate multi-layered narratives. By ‘presencing’ truth claims that are absent or sidelined in dominant justice debates or formal justice avenues, they contribute to a thicker, multi-layered understanding of truth that goes beyond what is already known. On the basis of interviews with Syrian writers, filmmakers, and justice actors, the paper explores the potential of literary writing, cinema and victim-led initiatives to counter the erasure of victims’ experiences, thus opening up the ‘justice imagination’; ways of thinking about what is possible in terms of justice, within and beyond formal avenues.",Ghent University,Ghent University,,,,,,,Ghent University,,Tine Destrooper,brigitte herremans,,,,,,,brigitte herremans,,Civil Society,Human Rights,Narratives,Transitional justice,,,,,How Informal Truth Practices Can Entail a Thicker Understanding of Truth in the Syrian Context,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64928&EventID=185
0,"Many urban areas across the globe are facing water scarcity issues driven by climate change and continued population growth. To foster a broad transition toward more sustainable urban water management, we must better understand how and why some water utilities transform their management strategies and practices to adapt to these challenges while others continue to rely on short-term coping measures that may have the perverse effect of increasing their vulnerability. Although several factors have been shown to influence water management transitions (Garcia et al. 2019), little attention has been paid to the highly diverse institutional structures of water utilities and how they may create unique incentives for or barriers to urban water management transition (Deslatte et al. 2021). In this paper, we expand upon a conceptual model of dynamic change to investigate how various institutional structures of water utilities in the United States may foster or impede transformation. Drawing on an empirical institutional analysis of sixteen urban water utilities using the institutional grammar approach to derive key attributes of different utility types (Crawford and Ostrom, 1995), we analyze how different institutional arrangements create incentives and barriers associated with water management transitions toward sustainability. Our findings advance theory on the connection between institutional structure and transformative potential, with lessons for water utilities and other entities in urban areas dealing with complex and long-term sustainability challenges.

0,"We investigate how institutional quality affected the economic downturn in EU countries during the COVID-19 pandemic. Using quarterly time-series cross-sectional data, we show that there was a robust positive and significant relationship - countries with higher quality of governance and higher scores of economic freedom suffered markedly less. Importantly, institutions mattered more when the pandemic hit most forcefully. Thus, the pandemic highlights the asymmetric impact of seemingly symmetric exogenous shocks on EU economies and raises important issues about the necessary reforms for short-run resilience and long-run convergence.",Vilnius University,General Jonas Žemaitis Military Academy of Lithuania,,,,,,,Vilnius University,,Vytautas Kuokstis,Ringailė Kuokštytė,,,,,,,Vytautas Kuokstis,,European Union,Governance,Institutions,Political Economy,Member States,,,,How Institutions Moderated the Pandemic's Economic Impact in EU Member States,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65542&EventID=185
0,"Western European prisons have been described as spaces of radicalisation towards political violence and terrorism. Contrary, Provisional IRA in the 1980s and 1990s played a crucial part in supporting the Northern Irish peace process. Moreover, Provisional Irish republican prisoners held in the high-security prisons on both sides of the Irish border had a decisive role in shaping the politics of the political party Sinn Féin and winning support for the emerging peace process. In this paper, I will present a theoretical framework to analyse the learning processes of political prisoners and how political prisoners can shape political developments outside the prison walls. To do so, I will use the Northern Ireland Troubles as a case study.
Of the many groups supporting the Northern Irish peace process in the 1990s, former inmates of internment camps and prisons are one of the most remarkable. This group is noteworthy because it was formed of collectives of political prisoners who were almost entirely self-educated. The paper examines how the informal self-education courses evolved in the 1970s and 1980s, and, subsequently, the republican internees and prisoners used the newly acquired knowledge to influence political developments outside the prisons, particularly during the peace process in the 1990s. In essence, this paper shows how Irish republicans supported the peace process from within the prisons. 
Moreover, the paper’s argument challenges the politicisation/de-radicalisation thesis, dominant in the Troubles’ scholarly analyses. It replaces this perspective with a more profound and subtle argument about the informal education and political subjectification of Irish republican prisoners. It is an approach that foregrounds prisoners’ agency during these years of fierce armed conflict and their essential role in the peace process. Particular focus is given on the question of how prisoners discussed and informed crucial political changes of the political party Sinn Féin, such as the dropping of abstentionism to Dáil Éireann, the establishment of a Sinn Féin Women’s Department, the internationalisation and adoption of a leftwing political programme by Sinn Féin.
In sum, the paper presents empirical data and a theoretical framework to analyse the learning processes of political prisoners beyond the Northern Irish Troubles. In so doing, I demonstrate how the prisons provided an environment for developing critical thinking and how prisoners used this experience to initiate the debates that eventually led to the acceptance of the peace process in Northern Ireland. Furthermore, I demonstrate how prisoners can shape the politics of political parties aligned to their militant social movements. The paper is based on 34 qualitative, semi-structured interviews with former Irish republican prisoners and archival material in Dublin, Belfast, and Galway.","National University of Ireland, Galway",,,,,,,,"National University of Ireland, Galway",,Dieter Reinisch,,,,,,,,Dieter Reinisch,,Conflict Resolution,Political Violence,Social Movements,Terrorism,War,Peace,Political Activism,,How IRA prisoners shaped Sinn Féin policy during the NI peace process,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64250&EventID=185
0,"Deprivation is widely considered to be a main driver of low political involvement, support for populist parties and disengagement from the political process. Thus far, much of this evidence is based on individual deprivation, i.e. in terms of citizens’ socio-economic status or social relationships. In contrast to that, we know quite little about how local circumstances in which citizens interact in their daily life (e.g. access to services, feeling at home, quality of life or regional exclusion) shape political support. Drawing on deprivation theory, I hypothesize that local deprivation decreases political support. Using data from the “Sub-national context and radical right support in Europe” (SCoRE) study (N_DE=25.976, N_NL=8.013, N_UK=25.001) and multilevel structural equation modeling I first find that feelings of regional exclusion have a strong negative effect on political support across age groups. In a second step, I combine the very fine-grained UK survey data (with identifiers on postcode district level) with macro data on mean income and income distribution of the districts along with the income difference to the next k (=2289) postcode districts. The results show a negative effect of greater income distribution on political support. Most importantly though, greater income difference from one’s own district to surrounding districts has a substantially negative effect on political support, too. This effect largely depends on the size of the unit we compare it with. The effect strength decreases with the number of compared postcode districts and virtually disappears at the size of widely used units for comparison like the NUTS-1 and NUTS-2. The results provide important implications for the deprivation literature and the application of multilevel modeling for deprivation research.",University of Bamberg,,,,,,,,University of Bamberg,,Sebastian Jungkunz,,,,,,,,Sebastian Jungkunz,,Political Participation,Political Sociology,Quantitative,Comparative Perspective,Public Opinion,,,,How Local Deprivation Shapes Political Support,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=62254&EventID=185
0,"When populist challenger parties enter parliament for the first time, mainstream parties’ initial reaction has often been to portray them as undemocratic political pariahs. Yet, in many instances, mainstream parties have switched strategy and no longer demonize and ostracize their populist challengers. I call such strategies delegitimizing and legitimizing strategies, respectively. In this study, I examine citizens’ reactions to (changes in) such strategies by mainstream parties. More specifically, I investigate three different reactions by citizens to mainstream parties’ (de-)legitimizing strategies: a) citizens’ evaluations of the targeted challenger, b) citizens’ evaluations of the mainstream party pursuing such strategies, and c) citizens’ attitudes towards the political system. Focusing on mainstream party communication, I conceptualize and operationalize (de-)legitimizing strategies as mainstream party messages portraying populist challengers – implicitly or explicitly – as (un-)democratic. To empirically test my theoretical propositions, I implement a survey experiment in Sweden (N=2,000).

0,"The paper reports findings from a crowdsourced replication. Eighty-five replicator teams attempted to verify numerical results reported in an original study by running the same models with the same data. The replication involved an experimental condition. A randomly assigned transparent group received the original study and code, and the other opaque group received only a methods section, a rough description of results and no code. The transparent group mostly verified the original study with the same sign and p-value threshold (95.7%), while the opaque group had less success (89.3%), but exact numerical reproductions to the second decimal place were far less common (76.9% and 48.1%). These results suggest that a single verification replication would only be reliable when the original study is highly transparent, otherwise it would take a minimum of three replicators to achieve this same level of confidence. Qualitative investigation of the replicators’ workflows reveals many causes of error including mistakes and variation in process. To provide a second ecological validity layer, the principal investigators corrected mistakes where possible. This improved the verification rate to 98.1% in the transparent group and 92.3% in the opaque group. If these results are ecologically valid, only highly transparent research would lead to reliable replications. This study sheds light on inter-researcher reliability and offers a baseline quantification. Although it may not be surprising that there is minor error among researchers, we show here this occurs where it is least expected and is large enough to undermine reliability between-researchers to some extent, possibly offering some quantifiable sources of the larger “reliability crisis” in social science. The more serious implications are that research involving more decision-making will inevitably cause more idiosyncratic variation in results across researchers. The obvious implication is greater transparency, something sociology only embraces at the margins. This study reminds us of the problematic knowledge being produced by a discipline with a lack-of-transparency as the status quo.",Universität Bremen,,,,,,,,Universität Bremen,,Nate Breznau,,,,,,,,Nate Breznau,,Welfare State,Political Sociology,Methods,Quantitative,Mixed Methods,Public Opinion,,,How Many Replicators Does It Take to Achieve Reliability?

0,"My presentation examines nationalism as a form of collective amnesia which renders international solidarity unimaginable. Nationalism as amnesia is connected to other forms of historical amnesia including white amnesia (Hesse 1997) and postcolonial melancholia (Gilroy 2004). It involves the production of ignorance and amnesia towards colonial legacies and present-day global inequalities; histories of migration, and global interdependencies and interconnections. Nationalism-as-amnesia involves the erasure of anti-racist, migrant justice and international solidarity movements from collective memory. This means that collective memory, and particularly those aspects of collective memory that shape a shared sense of our past, become consolidated around nationalism. This results in a nihilistic ‘nationalist realism’ (drawing on Mark Fisher’s ‘capitalist realism’) whereby the nation-state becomes unquestioningly accepted as the only site for politics (Brown 2019; Bhattacharyya et al 2020).
Based in UK migration politics but situated in a global context, the presentation will also explore how by memories of international solidarity and migrant justice can disrupt ‘nationalist realism’.  It will examine this through specific examples of anti-deportation protests, and how these are remembered over time. For participants and those who witness them (including through the media and social media platforms), anti-deportation protests, migrant justice and solidarity campaigns demonstrate to us that solidarity across borders is both imaginable and practically possible. After they have taken place, the memory of such actions can expand the political imaginary, particularly during moments when nationalist, xenophobic politics are dominant.  They remind us that the nation-state cannot be disconnected from its global context, both historically and within the present.",Birmingham City University,,,,,,,,Birmingham City University,,Kirsten Forkert,,,,,,,,Kirsten Forkert,,Migration,Nationalism,Memory,Solidarity,Activism,,,,How memories of international solidarity and migrant justice can disrupt ‘nationalist realism’,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64141&EventID=185
0,"While minipublics are currently burgeoning, their sustainability ultimately depends on their capacity to influence public decisions. For they would otherwise boil down to symbolic citizen participation and lose their credibility. Previous studies have traced the uptake of minipublics’ recommendations, but, when making their assessment, scholars rely on a set of implicit assumptions about what minipublics are supposed to achieve politically. This paper intends to problematize the concept of political influence and to write a summa of the literature on democratic theory and public policy to clarify what one should expect from minipublics. I argue that our expectations should depend on a configuration of factors. First, their political influence is contingent on two design characteristics—the number of participants and recommendations’ advisory or propositional character. Second, the content of a recommendation predisposes their impact too, as minipublics can recommend small implementation changes or a broader policy paradigm shift. We should finally expect different sorts of political influences depending not only on the policymaking stage where a minipublic is embedded, but also on the context of democratic decision-making, including decision-makers’ bounded rationality and political positions. Based on the assemblage of these factors, I develop a survey of the different forms and degrees of political influence one could—and should—expect from minipublics.",Vrije Universiteit Brussel,,,,,,,,Vrije Universiteit Brussel,,Julien Vrydagh,,,,,,,,Julien Vrydagh,,Democracy,Political Participation,Public Policy,Normative Theory,Policy-Making,,,,How much political influence should we expect from minipublics?,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63545&EventID=185
0,"It is increasingly recognized that social identities are an important source of political preferences and electoral behavior. However, it is less clear how exogenous the importance of different identities is to the political debate. Can political competition “activate” structural social identities by making them salient? Or is there an even stronger element of agency, in which party competition affects what people perceive as their most salient identities? 
In this paper, we study the results of a survey experiment conducted in Germany and France, in which we prime respondents to think about different axes of party competition. In one treatment group, we tell respondents that party competition mainly revolves around “cultural” questions of universalism or particularism. In a second treatment, we tell them that economic questions of redistribution and a free market are the focus of party competition. Afterwards, we ask respondents to indicate their closeness towards different social groups as well as their political preferences on several issues and their prospective vote choice.
We test whether these treatments increase the salience of certain social identities (related to class, education, residence and the like) and whether this increased salience translates into party choice. We expect French voters to have more congealed perceptions of the link between certain identities and certain parties due to the long-standing importance of a universalism-particularism cleavage. We expect the treatment to have stronger effects in Germany, on the other hand, where the more recent politicization of this cleavage means that the links between these identities and parties are more malleable. As a consequence, there should be more room for an effect of discourse and mobilization.",University of Zurich,University of Zurich,University of Zurich,University of Zurich,University of Zurich,,,,University of Zurich,,Lukas Haffert,Simon Bornschier,Marco Steenbergen,Silja Häusermann,Delia Zollinger,,,,Simon Bornschier,,Cleavages,Comparative Politics,Political Competition,Political Sociology,Identity,Experimental Design,Mobilisation,,How party competition shapes voters’ group identities and electoral preferences,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63435&EventID=185
0,"While governments' efforts to deepen European integration in the past were buoyed by tacit political support, it is increasingly scrutinized in the domestic arena. Driving the globalization backlash, political challenger parties have successfully politicized international cooperation across the world, leading governments to increasingly pay attention to their constituents' preferences when negotiating at the international level. This suggests that governments and mainstream parties are at the behest of political entrepreneurs and a critical public. Yet, a broad literature on cueing effects suggests that political actors have considerable leeway to shape public preferences - also about international cooperation. Using a pre-registered information treatment experiment in five countries, we examine the effect of in- and out-party cues about fiscal integration in the European Union (EU). The experiment was fielded at a moment in which questions pertaining to fiscal integration were highly salient (July 2020). We find that political parties have ample latitude to shape citizen preferences about far-reaching international cooperation, as both in-parties and out-parties significantly affect citizen preferences about fiscal integration. This pattern is remarkably robust across countries and citizens with different levels of ideological commitment to the EU. We further find that both successful and unsuccessful in-party cues significantly affect citizens' certainty about their preference for international cooperation - suggesting the importance of elite communication beyond direct persuasion.",Max Planck Institute for the Study of Societies – MPIfG,University of Amsterdam,Radboud Universiteit Nijmegen,Ghent University,,,,,University of Amsterdam,,Björn Bremer,Theresa Kuhn,Maurits Meijers,Francesco Nicoli,,,,,Theresa Kuhn,,European Politics,Political Economy,Political Parties,Political Psychology,Public Opinion,,,,How party cues can affect fiscal integration preferences: a survey experiment in six European countries,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65171&EventID=185
0,"It is frequently claimed that political science has become more methodologically plural since the late 1990s and early 2000s, when a disciplinary mainstream rooted in the hegemony of quantitative methods and formal modelling was confronted with an organised revolt of scholars seeking better representation of qualitative and interpretive approaches. Now, qualitative approaches find more space in top journals, interdisciplinarity is en vogue and mixed-methods are frequently labelled as best practice. Some however still stress the cosmetic nature of these changes. This position contends that while methods are indeed more diverse, the research most rewarded with citation counts, grant money and prestigious positions is still anchored in positivist philosophical beliefs. Interpretivist research, focusing on meaning-making activities, is still claimed to languish at the margins of the discipline. Furthermore, it is claimed that the hegemony of positivist research has negative consequences for political science’s collective capacity for knowledge-building. 

Despite the theoretical sophistication of these critiques, there has been little systematic investigation of their empirical merits. For this purpose, we assess the prevalence over time, as well as the respective strengths and weaknesses, of varying theoretical and methodological approaches within a specific academic debate: the body of literature on democratization in post-communist Central and Eastern Europe, a key empirical puzzle in the early 21st century that also provides an important and diverse pool of research to support a large-N comparative approach. Our empirical strategy rests on the coding of a random sample of 500 papers published in the top 20 general political science journals and the top 5 area studies journals over the period 2000-2015. Specifically, we recorded the theoretical frameworks, methodologies and thematic foci of each paper and then tested the consequences of these choices on academic reach (citation count and journal ranking) and prognostic capacity (coded ‘high’ for papers concluding with greater pessimism/ skepticism about the extent of democratisation in the light of radical democratic backsliding in CEE that has been widely acknowledged since the end of our period of observation). Our quantitative analyses reveal that positivist criteria still largely determine whether research will be published in high-ranking journals and, even more tellingly, how much other scholars cite a paper regardless of the journal in which it is published. More fundamentally, the relative under-representation of non-positivist standpoints   has an adverse impact on the knowledge-building capacity of the discipline as a whole. Qualitative papers and those focusing on civil society, which we find are generally less cited, are also more likely to display pessimistic conclusions—this also stands for papers published in area studies journals, the least prestigious in our sample. While rewarded with less academic recognition at the time, these accounts have generally aged better. Positivist papers generally displayed less caution about the pace of democratisation in the region, yet received far greater recognition within the discipline.",Centre for Trust Peace and Social Relations,University of Exeter,,,,,,,Centre for Trust Peace and Social Relations,,James Dawson,Lise Herman,,,,,,,James Dawson,,Europe (Central and Eastern),Comparative Politics,Democratisation,Political Methodology,Quantitative,,,,How pluralist is the study of politics?

However, as the political signal theory reveals, it has been observed that while fulfilling this function, the regulatory authorities cannot escape from the interventions and control of the political power. In addition, capture theory scholars claim that regulation is designed and operated for the benefit of the dominant capital groups in the sector. This article aims to discuss both approaches in the case of the Turkish radio and TV sector. Following the liberalization of the sector in 1994, the Turkish Radio and Television Supreme Council was established as a regulatory body to control market entry and exit, protect competition and determine broadcasting service standards. Our findings support the idea that the close relations between capital groups and the important political figures, which is clearly known from the very beginning of the liberalization of the sector, facilitate these groups to gain a privileged position in the media sector. On the basis of the data gathered, document analysis, and interviews, we claim that the Turkish Radio and Television Supreme Council has been captured by both political power and the dominant capitalist groups in the sector by losing its administrative and financial autonomy.",Istanbul University,The University of Queensland,,,,,,,Istanbul University,,Özgün Akduran Erol,Yunus Yigit,,,,,,,Özgün Akduran Erol,,Political Economy,Regulation,Television,Political Engagement,Power,,,,How Political Power and Capital Captures a Regulatory Authority: Turkey’s Radio and Television Supreme Council,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=66109&EventID=185
0,"Today’s food production and consumption patterns are associated with serious threats to the environment and human health. Especially, the current meat system contributes to manifold sustainability crises. Here, we ask to what extent (policy) narratives and policy actor coalitions regarding meat consumption and production have changed in Germany and the US over the last 10 years. Particularly, we are interested in the role that technological innovations (especially the rise of meat substitutes) played in driving these changes. 

In a mixed-method comparative study, we test the hypothesis that technological innovations in meat substitutes can lead to new policy narratives that eventually create new actor coalitions and feed back into relevant political processes for transforming the meat system (e.g., adoption of meat taxes).
 
We combine qualitative process-tracing and novel natural language-processing methods with discourse network analysis to test our hypothesis. Empirical analysis of narratives has faced the challenge that the objects under scrutiny consist of extensive collections of unstructured text. Measuring the relevant content of these texts (not to mention using it in a causal analysis) requires the adoption of new tools outside the standard social science kit. We draw upon a number of recently developed natural language processing techniques, namely semantic role labeling and phrase embedding, to extract narratives from text. We apply the narrative embedding pipeline to newspapers in Germany and the US. The resulting longitudinal dataset on the evolution of respective actor networks around policy narratives and instruments can be used to conduct discourse network analyses over time. In conjunction with qualitative process-tracing methods, we then test to what extent the rise of novel technologies (especially meat substitutes) has affected policy narratives and actor coalitions around transformative food policies.",Universität Bern,Universität St Gallen,,,,,,,Universität Bern,,Lukas Fesenfeld,Adrian Rinscheid,,,,,,,Lukas Fesenfeld,,Political Economy,Public Policy,Narratives,Policy Change,Policy-Making,,,,How technological innovations in meat substitutes feed back in the politics of meat system transformation,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65876&EventID=185

0,"This paper modifies, to some extent, 'Type III' of neoclassical realism. The current state of knowledge shows that states 'choose from a range of policy alternatives to navigate between systemic constraints and domestic political imperatives.' (Ripsman, Lobell, Taliaferro 2016: 34). This assumes that systemic and domestic constraints are constant at the moment of making decision.

The first question is: are these factors really constant? The basic claim of this paper is that they are not. Change assumes modifications in systemic and domestic pressures already in the decision-making process. Three reasons are the most important. Firstly, the willingness to make a decision causes the likelihood of modification in systemic stimuli. This transition takes effect when the potential for change influences decision-makers so strongly that shifting their attitudes will generate an appropriate systemic pressure. In other words, if, according to other stats perceptions, a given decision will have an impact on the systemic transition, it will cause other states reactions to influence the systemic transition even before making a decision.

Secondly, the change in the state of international system carried out in a relatively short period of time means a relative inconstancy of domestic pressures. The previous state of the international system (before the intention to make a decision appeared) could effectively preserve domestic pressures, limiting the possibility of making certain decisions. The change in the state of the system may make these domestic pressures irrelevant. The pressures to date may not limit the state's ability to implement certain decisions or may even turn out to be insignificant, which may change the state's position in the system.

Thirdly, the relative interdependence of domestic pressures is also important. Changing the significance of one of the domestic pressures may cause an increase or decrease in the significance of other domestic pressures. It may also change the state possibilities  and result in taking a different, previously impossible decision.

The second question is: how does this affect the conceptualization of the relationship between domestic and structural variables? Three issues described above show that systemic constraints do not delimit domestic variables, but they are interconnected. This interconnection influences both types of constraints, changing the conditions in which their significance increases. This redefinition of relations between structural and domestic variables could make a significant contribution to theoretical analyzes of neoclassical realism.",University of Warsaw,,,,,,,,University of Warsaw,,Mateusz Ambrożek,,,,,,,,Mateusz Ambrożek,,Foreign Policy,International Relations,Realism,Causality,Decision Making,Theoretical,,,How the Possibility of Change Affects Change: The Unstable Nature of Domestic and Structural Pressures in Neoclassical Realism,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=62329&EventID=185
0,"Radical right parties (RRPs) have been the most successful party family in the advanced capitalist democracies during the past three decades. Previous research has intensely studied the causes of their electoral rise, but we know very little about their consequences for the largest part of government spending and regulation: the welfare state. This is what the present book project investigates.

The first aim is to identify how RRPs have influenced social policies when in government in Eastern Europe, Western Europe, and the USA (Trump administration), i.e. their social policy impact. The second aim is to explain cross-national variation in the social policy impacts of RRPs in government. 

My account argues that the institutional legacies of different welfare regimes play a crucial role in shaping the social policy priorities of PRRPs. This assumption builds on well-established insights about how previous policy choices create feedback mechanisms that influence the policy options perceived to be available to political parties. In short, the radical right’s social policy agenda cannot be understood without considering how radical right parties draw on historically evolved and nationally distinct ways of balancing capitalist markets and social protection.",University of Edinburgh,,,,,,,,University of Edinburgh,,Philip Rathgeb,,,,,,,,Philip Rathgeb,,Nationalism,Political Economy,Political Parties,Populism,Social Policy,Welfare State,Comparative Perspective,Capitalism,How the Radical Right has Changed the Welfare State in Europe and the USA,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=62579&EventID=185
0,"Recent studies show that many voters are willing to support candidates who advocate illiberal procedures under certain conditions. Accordingly, many citizens trade off the protection of democratic norms in elections against partisan and policy interests. These studies, however, do not take into account that people might support politicians who advocate illiberal practices out of conviction, nor how to mitigate these illiberal tendencies. To address this gap, we use a novel survey experiment that examines the relevance of (a) citizens’ populist attitudes and conceptions of democracy in explaining support for politicians who advocate illiberalism as well as of (b) procedural justice in defending democracy. We argue that citizens’ support for politicians who seek to undermine democratic principles is motivated by a polity congruence between voters’ and politicians’ populist beliefs and conceptions of democracy. In addition, we examine whether individuals’ experience with procedural justice affects the likelihood of supporting politicians who advocate illiberal procedures. In our experimental design, respondents are first exposed to an intervention with varying levels of procedural justice. Respondents are then presented with several vignettes of politicians using democratic or illiberal procedures to implement their policy proposals in local politics.

0,"By the late 2010s, courts of law, in particular administrative courts acting in judicial review competences, came to represent the last remaining component of what had been left of the system of check and balances established in transitioning Hungary in the 1990s. It was therefore unsurprising - also taking into account similar developments in other EU Member States in CEE - that the reigning government's attention turned to the administrative justice system and its role played in constraining the otherwise fairly unconstrained executive. Pursuing different strategies over the years, administrative courts in Hungary have become exposed more and more to the influence of politics. However, EU law, as has been recognised in previous academic writing, seems to offer a possible solution for saving independent judicial review in Hungary. Hungarian administrative courts, especially at supreme court level, have been proactive users of EU substantive law as well as the preliminary ruling process, which may suggest that willing administrative judges and judicial chambers may find an excuse for continuing to exercise their powers in their obligations as national courts under EU law. In this paper, we examine the evidence relating to the use of EU law by Hungarian administrative courts in exercising their competences in judicial review, in particular the use of EU law provisions governing access to courts and judicial protection, and aim to establish on that basis whether EU law has played and may likely to play in the future a decisive role in judicial review in Hungary.",Centre for Social Sciences,Centre for Social Sciences,,,,,,,Centre for Social Sciences,,Marton Varju,Mónika Papp,,,,,,,Marton Varju,,Europe (Central and Eastern),Courts,Jurisprudence,,,,,,Hungarian administrative courts under pressure: can EU law save judicial review in Hungary?,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63366&EventID=185

‘‘Hungarianism’. People have become accustomed to “sitting in Hungarian rooms and drinking Hungarian water, while reading Hungarian books and talking to Hungarian people; they even wear Hungarian glasses.’

Agnes Heller, interview extracts, Agnes Heller and Everyday Revolutions, Portrait of a Philosopher, 2015.

The words of the late Agnes Heller, a Hungarian activist and philosopher, highlight the paradoxes that emerge within populist political thinking and its historical relationship to state-making as a ‘blueprint’ of imperialist thought and an energising concept of modernity (Arendt, 1951). Heller’s words also highlight how thinkers on both the ‘left’ and the ‘right’ in Hungary have developed arguments about morality and citizenship as they live through the nation-building project. In light of ascending 21st century authoritarianism and transformations in both HE governance reform and the forced move of the CEU to Vienna, the significance of Heller’s reflections could not be more pressing as a study of modern institutional and symbolic violence and accelerating transformations in populist HE political imaginaries.  In this paper, we explore Heller’s concerns about ‘Hungarianisation’ within HE, with a particular focus on its ‘inner circle’ of elite knowledge makers and HE student resistance to authoritarianism.  Drawing from the work of Arendt, Caverero, Dragos, and Mbembe, we examine the rise of populism in HE as a moralistic governing strategy through three distinct avenues.  First, drawing upon archival and journalistic sources we examine the history of conservative elite knowledge-makers accounts (e.g., lawyers, theologians) of ethnonationalist citizenship as a claim to historical ‘victimhood’ to justify the introduction of novel forms of neo-nationalism into HE (Brogger, 2021; Dragos, 2020). We focus particularly on Hungarian scholarly accounts of the relationship between science, critical theory, conservative ideology, race and religion, secularism and the emergence of modern Hungarian politics. Second, placing oral history interviews and theoretical activist writings about state-making dating from the 1950s until the present into context, we explore how modalities of HE student resistance sought to challenge authoritarian strains within Hungarian HE. Finally, drawing on interview data and visual representations of student political action, we examine activist accounts of the forced move of the CEU across the European frontier space to Vienna. In so doing, we argue that Hungary’s claim to legal forms of authoritarianism in HE have fulfilled, at least in part, the mission of Hungarian statecraft to energise a ‘folktale of historical injustice’ (Felman, 2001) about the place of Hungary in global geopolitics and the history of empire. These practices represent the narration of a ‘sacred narrative’ and identity about Hungary’s past into contemporary legal and educational arenas as a nation-building strategy. In considering current student activist attempts at highlighting the ‘funeral of education’ in Hungarian HE, we aim to ‘decanonise and desacralize’ (Felman, 2001) such accounts as a way towards invoking a ‘critical consciousness’ of populism as it lives in HE today (Nora, 1989).",University of Cambridge,University of Cambridge,,,,,,,University of Cambridge,,Joanne Dillabough,Lakshmi Sagarika Bose,,,,,,,Joanne Dillabough,,Citizenship,National Identity,Populism,Critical Theory,Higher Education,Activism,Political Cultures,Transitional justice,"Hungarianisation, Horrorism  and a ‘Funeral for Higher Education’ – Populist Imaginaries and Knowledge-Making in 21st Century Hungary",https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65408&EventID=185
0,"The rapid growth of data-driven techniques has greatly enlarged the influence of digital media on political campaigning. Political messages are increasingly matched to individuals through social media. Matching takes place using large databases containing personal information that voters – knowingly and mostly unwittingly – leave online, such as individual characteristics, preferences, and behaviors. Many fear that these political microtargeting techniques on social media are a harmful phenomenon. We know, however, astonishingly little about whether or not political targeting practices actually sway voters, ultimately affecting, and possibly undermining elections and democracies. The dominant view that data-driven campaigning has detrimental effects per se can also be questioned. In this paper, we propose and test a novel dual-processing theory of political targeting in different country contexts. Our model is based on both the Elaboration Likelihood Model (ELM) and Motivated Reasoning Theory. We focus on two important factors when confronted with targeting messages: whether people are motivated and able to process the message. If people are more motivated and able to process the message, then people will engage in deep processing. The matched message is inherently more relevant, thus people engage in issue-relevant thinking and read, remember and store the targeted message better. If people are less motivated and able to process the message, then the citizens will engage in superficial processing. The matched message will function as a cue. People see it is relevant for themselves, yet because they lack motivation and ability, they do not engage in issue-relevant thinking. Whether processing has an influence depends on people’s goals (based on motivated reasoning). When people follow accuracy goals, people attend to the information, process it carefully and invest in reasoning. However, when voters follow directional goals, people want to protect and maintain a predetermined attitude or conclusion and reject dis-confirming information. To empirically test our model, we will conduct already planned preregistered experiments in March in the U.S., India, and the Netherlands. In the experiment, participants will be asked to use a mock social media site on a daily basis for a week where targeted messages will be shown. We will manipulate how many times respondents are exposed to a specific targeted message (ability) and how well this message fits the interests of the respondent (motivation). The arguments in the targeted message will either be in line with the position of the respondent on a certain issue or against the position of the respondent on a certain issue. We will thus create different conditions for different respondents. We will measure the normative outcomes (i.e., political knowledge, voting intentions, interest, issue position) at the end of the week. By making the comparison between three countries with a very different political context, we gain insight in how similar the impact of microtargeting on voters exactly is.",University of Amsterdam,,,,,,,,University of Amsterdam,,Annelien Van Remoortere,,,,,,,,Annelien Van Remoortere,,Elections,Campaign,Social Media,Communication,Comparative Perspective,Experimental Design,,,Hunting for Voters: The Impact of Data-Driven Campaigning on Democracy,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64035&EventID=185
0,"While crisis has been a prominent theme in commentary on democratic politics of late, under generic headings such as ‘populism’, it is in the United States (where indeed the phenomenon of populism originated) that the crisis is most visible. Hence there is need for analysis which captures the specificity of this case without obscuring its more general theoretical implications. A model for such an approach is Tocqueville’s Democracy in America.
The present crisis is multidimensional, but a unifying feature is its epistemic character: it arises from the complex and contested relationship between knowledge and democracy. We can see it as the extension of the democratic principle that people should make up their own minds into an arena not previously (except in the case of ‘freedom of conscience’) thought subject to it: to the production and acceptance of facts. Facts such as the result of a presidential election or the efficacy of a vaccine against a deadly pandemic disease strike one immediately as emblematic of this novel problem, dwarfing even the issues examined under the heading of ‘post-truth’ several years ago. Epistemic questions also underlie current concerns about both broadcast and social media. Democratic theory is no longer dominated by the optimistic theory of ‘cognitive mobilization’, whereby rising education and more rapidly circulating information would extend and entrench democracy. But it is not yet clear what paradigm should succeed it.
While Tocqueville’s most famous doubt, about democracy’s ‘tyranny of the majority’, merely restated classical fears of demagoguery, his principal explanatory factor ‘equality of condition’ yielded more original insights. Its strong epistemic dimension is illustrated in Tocqueville’s famous formulation of his project, ‘When I compare the Greek and Roman republics to these republics of America, the manuscript libraries of the first and their coarse populace, to the thousand newspapers that crisscross the second and the enlightened people who inhabit them … I am tempted to burn my books so as to apply only new ideas to a social state so new.’ Juxtaposing today’s far more massive flow of information with the political coarseness seen on 6 January 2021, we see the need for further innovation, but here too Tocqueville offers cues: ‘there is a sort of ignorance that is born of extreme publicity. In despotic states men do not know how to act because they are told nothing; in democratic nations they often act at random because they are told everything’.
Much has changed that Tocqueville could not anticipate, in the fields of media, science, religion and jurisprudence that constitute the epistemic dimension of democracy. But his view of democracy as a complex and emergent socio-political (and not merely governmental) phenomenon, containing its own contradictions and resulting dynamics, is a model for a similarly broad rethinking of democratic theory today. Developing arguments I made in my book Hyperdemocracy (Palgrave Macmillan, 2013), I focus on Tocqueville in order to examine the democratic roots of the present crisis of democracy, and to assess the extent to which the American case is exemplary.",Durham University,,,,,,,,Durham University,,Stephen Welch,,,,,,,,Stephen Welch,,Democracy,USA,Knowledge,,,,,,Hyperdemocracy in America: Tocquevillian Perspectives on the Democratic Crisis,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65809&EventID=185
0,"The studies of citizens‘ perception of pledge fulfilment previously found that people are influenced in the evaluation of pledge fultilment by their interest in politics, issue salience or personal experience with the issue. The distance decay effect has, however, not be studied yet in the studies of citizens‘ pledge evaluations. The fact that the pledge non/fulfilment can be geographically localized closer to some citizens than to the others, can influence the spreading of the information only for some citizens, and therefore, to increase the correctness of their evaluation of pledge fulfilment. In the proposed paper we examine the perception of pledge fulfilment at the local level. Research was conducted as comparative analysis of 6 municipalities in Southern Moravian Region (Brno, Blansko, Břeclav, Vranovice, Tišnov, Vyškov). The municipalities differ significantly in their size. Firstly, we analyze party coalition agreements in municipalities and find that there is a difference in what is proposed to citizens in different municipalities. There are only few localized promises in coalition agreement in the biggest city (Brno), whereas coalition agreements in smaller towns are composed mainly from pledges localized to distinct parts of the municipalities. Secondly, we look on what affects the correct perception of pledge fulfilment. Analysis is based on data from exit-poll survey conducted in front of 56 polling places during 2018 local elections covering opinion of 2 500 respondents. What we consider here as factor specific for local politics is strong connection to local environment. Pledge is more likely to be connected to certain location in local elections than in national one. We asked about fulfillment of several pledges embodied in some locality within municipality. We analyzed differences in awareness of fulfilment according to factors considered as important on national level (issue salience, political knowledge, voting for ruling coalition) and on geographical distance to location of given pledge. We identified strong effect of distance, especially in the case of fulfilled pledges in municipalities outside Brno. Contrarily, we found stronger effect in the case of broken promise in Brno. Results can be interpreted as a manifestation of phenomenon labeled as distance decay in information flow.",Masaryk University,University of Hradec Králové,,,,,,,Masaryk University,,Petr Voda,Petra Vodová,,,,,,,Petr Voda,,Democracy,Elections,Local Government,Party Manifestos,Analytic,,,,"I Don't Know, it's Not on My Backyard!

0,"An extensive body of research published around the world during the past several months of the COVID-19 pandemic attests to an increase in symptoms of anxiety and fear among the population at large. It goes without saying that this change does not bode well for people’s mental health. However, its implications are more far-reaching, posing a threat to the entire social fabric, including relationships between political or ideological groups. In two studies conducted during COVID-19, one in Israel and the other in the U.S., we found that high anxiety levels are associated with higher levels of hatred towards ordinary people from the respective political outgroup, lower levels of willingness to initiate or sustain interpersonal relations with those people (i.e., greater social distance) and greater support for exclusionist policies towards those people. We have also provided evidence that the mechanism behind these relationships is perception of threat posed by the political outgroup. Put differentlly, the perception of threat from the political outgroup is strengthened with the rising anxiety level, leading to hatred, social distancing and exclusionist policy support. Theoretically, we know that anxiety can potentially lead to increased sensitivity to, or overestimation of, threats. It is also known that threat perceptions can increase hatred, intolerance and exclusionist tendencies towards the source of threat. However, most literature on inter-party hostility has thus far explored this relationship within the same domain (i.e., anxiety on account of X relates to perceptions of threat from X and hostility towards the same X). This study is the first to examine a mechanism pivoting on perceived threat from the political outgroup during the current pandemic, when the anxiety is driven by an external threat that is largely unrelated (or at least not directly related) to the context of inter-group relations. We concluded that, in the extreme circumstances that the United States were faced with, on account of both the pandemic (i.e., the acute escalation in COVID-19 casualties) and the socio-political factors (i.e., two weeks after the storming of the U.S. Capitol and several days before the inauguration of President-elect Joe Biden), anxiety in the health domain might have infected the political domain, increasing people’s hostility towards the outgroup. The implication of such mechanism may go beyond the relationship between anxiety due to COVID-19 and inter-party relations. Most importantly, it means that times of economic, health, political or other crisis creates a fertile ground for the development of hatred and animosity that go beyond the groups that are perceived as relevant for the creation of the specific crisis. Societies and leaders, should be aware of these potentially destructive implications, and take some preventive steps to moderate them. In this sense, the findings presented here can be extrapolated to different anxiety-triggering situations, different sources of perceived threat, and hostility towards different groups that are thought to pose such a threat. This dynamic, however, requires further research.",Hebrew University of Jerusalem,,,,,,,,Hebrew University of Jerusalem,,Meital Balmas,,,,,,,,Meital Balmas,,Political Psychology,Public Opinion,Empirical,,,,,,I hate you when I am anxious: The effect of anxiety during the COVID-19 epidemic on ideological hostility,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=62252&EventID=185
0,"Following Brexit, several observers noted that, while the EU would be deprived a major foreign policy actor with significant capabilities, it would also lose a member state that had consistently objected against a more ambitious common foreign and security policy. To date, scholarly attention has focused on what Brexit means for the EU (and UK) foreign policy capacity, but few studies have specifically examined how Brexit might have altered negotiation practices, bargaining strategies and coalition-formation patterns in EU foreign policy negotiations. This paper sets out to fill this gap, by investigating to what extent the UK’s departure from the EU has influenced the ways in which member states negotiate over foreign and security policy. 
This contribution first engages in an exploratory network analysis of PSC coalition re-configurations before and after Brexit, thus providing a broad overview of the ways in which coalition-formation dynamics changed once the UK was no longer in the EU. Relying on an original set of elite interviews with EU officials and national diplomats, the paper then focuses on two distinct CFSP/CSDP negotiations, which took place before and immediately afterwards the Brexit referendum: the agreement on the sanction regime against Russia (March-July 2014) and the launch of the Permanent Structured Cooperation in December 2017. In so doing, the paper focuses on a negotiation where the UK played a significant role (Russian sanctions negotiation) and one where London no longer contributed to the decision-making process (PESCO). 
This paper offers a number of insights on the transformative effects of the UK’s departure from the EU. For one, it shows that the impact of the Brexit on EU foreign policy is very much issue-dependent. While the absence of the UK in the PESCO negotiations allowed to make significant inroads into greater cooperation in the area of security and defense, the expertise and brokering role of UK during the first sanction negotiations against Russia proved critical for a concerted response to the annexation of Crimea. While there is no shortage of member states that are willing to fill in the shoes of the UK in CFSP/CSDP negotiations and embrace what used to be British positions, the PESCO negotiations suggest that they might not always be able to throw their weight around the same way London used to.",University College Dublin,,,,,,,,University College Dublin,,Marianna Lovato,,,,,,,,Marianna Lovato,,European Politics,European Union,Brexit,,,,,,I will miss you when you’re gone (or not): examining EU foreign policy negotiations pre- and post-Brexit,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63671&EventID=185
0,"ABSTRACT:
In response to criticisms from those concerned with action-guiding normative prescriptions, there is a growing tendency in the literature on migration to bridge the gap between ideal and realist approaches to migration by showing how both can converge to similar normative verdicts in the here and now (Carens 2019; Miller 2016). More specifically, the charge often directed to ideal theories of migration is that they are utopian because they commend transitions from the current unjust state of affairs to an alleged fully just state of affairs that are too far from the concerns and preferences of peoples in the here and now (Miller 2008). Those who subscribe to ideal theories respond that ideal theory can treat such concerns and preferences as contextual feasibility constraints on approximating justice from the here and now. Hence, they argue, ideal theorists can espouse those reforms and policies that are feasible given these contextual constraints (Carens 2019). Convergence between ideal and realist perspectives is therefore reached, according to this view, not based on whether such reforms are fully just but on what is the only commendable course of action on the grounds of justice given prevailing feasibility constraints. In this paper, I argue that the conclusion that there is such convergence is too quick. There are at least two sets of cases where an ideal theory should not commend a move from an unjust state of affairs to a more just state of affairs that approximates a fully just state of affairs. This thesis is supported by drawing a distinction between approximating a fully just state of affairs and achieving a fully just state of affairs and by showing that the approximation of a fully just state of affairs does not always facilitate the achievement of a fully just state of affairs. This suggests I argue that the path to a fully just state of affairs can be blocked by reforms that maximally approximate a fully just state of affairs in the here and now. Using an example from the migration literature, I show that not only a concern for achieving a fully just state of affairs but also a more moderate concern for the reduction of global inequalities, by, for instance, increasing levels of migration in the here and now, can lead to a temporary decrease in the levels of global inequality in the near future and yet to even higher levels of global inequalities in the long term than those currently observed and anticipated. Therefore, also the dilemma between global and domestic justice in the literature on migration ultimately depends on the nature of the causal paths available at any given point in time, regardless of whether one takes an ideal or a nonideal approach. I conclude that both those who subscribe to utopian theories of justice and those who espouse comparativist approaches have reasons to be sceptical towards unqualified calls for convergence between more ideal and more realist approaches to theorising about migration.",Johann Wolfgang Goethe-Universität Frankfurt,,,,,,,,Johann Wolfgang Goethe-Universität Frankfurt,,Dimitrios Efthymiou,,,,,,,,Dimitrios Efthymiou,,Migration,Political Methodology,Political Theory,Methods,Normative Theory,,,,Ideal vs Realist Approaches to Migration: The Case Against their Convergence,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63264&EventID=185
0,"There are good kinds of ideal theory and bad kinds of ideal theory.   In her 2009 article Laura Valentini argues Rawls employs the former in his early work A Theory of Justice and the latter in his subsequent work The Law of Peoples.  The problem in The Law of Peoples is that Rawls “idealises the subject of justice” by assuming all states in the international community (the subject of justice) will be liberal democracies.  This assumption feeds prescriptions that simply will not work – and will, if anything, exacerbate injustice –  for non-liberal or impoverished regimes. 

Yet Rawls also employs ideal theory in A Theory of Justice to model individuals in the original position behind a veil of ignorance.  This, however, is considered an acceptable idealisation because it does not idealise the subject of justice.  The subject of justice is the basic structure being chosen not the original position from whence the individuals are choosing.  

I look to defend this account of acceptable and unacceptable idealisation from an objection that needs to be addressed to fill out the broader analytical picture.  Individuals in the original position will still be choosing a basic structure that is presumably not the actual basic structure.  The problem here is that political liberals assume the basic structure being chosen is the subject of justice (pace Cohen, 1997).  So while the original position construction is not in itself bad idealisation, it would appear it is still inevitable that there will be such idealisation at some point in the process.  We will inevitably be idealizing the subject of justice when we prescribe an ideal basic structure. Does this imply all considerations of constitutional policymaking from the perspective of (at least) political liberalism is doomed to failure? 

My strategy for avoiding this conclusion is to, first, outline a distinction between a realistic account of the subject of justice and a non-realistic one.  Bad idealisation is idealisation of the subject of justice that uses unrealistic ideals; good idealisation is idealisation of the subject of justice that uses realistic ideals.  (I should flag though that I am not yet sure how this distinction relates to political realism – if it does at all.)  By a realistic ideal I mean one that is empirically possible i.e. not metaphysically impossible (see Kripke, 1971).  The second strategy that flows from this is to be open to stipulating multiple ideals.  That is to say, open to accepting different basic structures in different circumstances.  I have explicitly defended the jargon-heavy concept of empirical possibility for political philosophy at previous meetings of the ECPR Methods Group – and I will do so again here.  What I am trying to get at is just how many different problems in the literature it appears to solve.",The London School of Economics & Political Science,,,,,,,,The London School of Economics & Political Science,,Will Bosworth,,,,,,,,Will Bosworth,,Political Theory,Social Justice,Methods,Normative Theory,,,,,Idealising the subject of justice,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63333&EventID=185
0,"As other “exoticizations”, the most commonplace images and ideas about the tropics (“vibrant” flora, succulent fruits, malleable sociability and their own ailments, etc.) underwent discursive and ideological constructions that suffered from different cultural and political influences. Influences that were and are elaborated in view of contexts of dispute about the meanings of the European colonies overseas and about the identities of these places with the de(s)colonization in the most diverse fields. The central question that we focus on is how these ideals and images were negotiated, in a productive tension between localism and cosmopolitanism, by some important political and cultural agents in Brazilian social and artistic history (artists in the Empire, parts of the modernisms and in the dissonant tropicalisms of Gilberto Freyre and the tropicalists) in the sense of producing active representations of Brazilianness. We tried to read texts and images with two purposes: (i) to identify discourses and ideas about tropicality in Brazil and its effects in order to produce decisive representations about the country and (ii) to verify the absorption and twists operated, in different ways, by some artistic and cultural sectors, in Brazil, from this repertoire of symbolic artifacts in an attempt to produce interpretations about Brazilian difference, Brazilianness and “Brazilian civilization”. There are three important methodological points in our work: (a) ideas and artistic objects have a functioning that goes beyond their context; (b) intellectual and artistic artifacts are social and political forces that offer interpretations which forge meanings and meanings for social life and for the political and intellectual disputes that constitute it, and (c) symbolic artifacts are modes of representation active in political and intellectual disputes. decisive social factors for society, the state and culture. The partial conclusions are three. First, this symbolic repertoire was decisive for negotiating, in different ways, aspects such as national political identity, the conformation of a “Brazilian” culture and art, and the constitutive differences of this “tropical civilization” vis-à-vis the world. Second, this symbolic repertoire had been formally and politically reused in different, even opposite ways, by different cultural and political agents and movements in the country. Thirdly, the discourses on tropicality contain internal nuances that cannot be left out, so that they would not be monolithic constructions, but rather laden with heterogeneities.",Departamento de Ciência Política FFLCH/USP,,,,,,,,Departamento de Ciência Política FFLCH/USP,,Rafael Marino,,,,,,,,Rafael Marino,,Citizenship,Civil Society,Political Cultures,,,,,,Ideas and images of tropicality: negotiated Brazilianities and imagined political identities of a “tropical civilization”,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=66020&EventID=185
0,"The theoretical debate regarding integrity at the individual level in both public and private sectors has been dominated primarily by analogies of “bad apples,” “bad barrels,” and “bad orchards.” When looking at corruption in the police services, for example, criminologists tend to reject the hypothesis that the issue is limited to a few rogue members (Newburn 2015), and focus not on the individual but on institutional failure (Newburn 2015; Punch 2009). Indeed, the notion of bad apples can be dangerously misleading in tackling structural or institutional issues as it implies that, other than investigating and sanctioning individuals who engage in misconduct, very little is required to keep organizations functioning properly. However, identifying the characteristics of bureaucrats who are likely to be implicated in wrongdoing may reveal much about how accountability systems work. Moreover, identifying and discussing whether – and, if so, why – disciplinary and internal affairs departments have been punishing, for example, more men than women, more experienced bureaucrats than inexperienced ones, and more career civil servants than those in positions of trust remains an unexplored research topic not only in Brazil but globally. This study tries to fill this gap by looking at the distribution of 5,000 administrative penalties imposed between 2003 and 2014 in the federal executive in Brazil (68% of them for corruption-related acts), and analyzing which civil servants are most likely to be sanctioned for corruption and which conditions differentiate them from those punished for other serious offences. Statistical analyses were performed on the subsample of sanctioned civil servants using the variables of gender, job tenure, status (career civil servant or occupant of a position of trust), and gross earnings. Analyses also included qualitative data gathered through 24 semi-structured interviews with civil servants directly involved with disciplinary sanctions. The study findings showed that those punished most often for corruption were men and those who were not in the first five years of their careers. Holding a special position or earning a bonus also increased the odds of being sanctioned for corruption as well as working for specific government bodies such as the traffic police.",Università di Bologna,,,,,,,,Università di Bologna,,Fernanda Odilla,,,,,,,,Fernanda Odilla,,Governance,Public Administration,Corruption,Ethics,,,,,Identifying individual conditions for being sanctioned for corruption: the case of the Brazilian federal executive,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65358&EventID=185
0,"In the 21st century, the world´s demand for natural resources is more pressing and deeply interconnected than ever before. The Water-Energy-Food (WEF) nexus has gained growing interest as a promising concept for complex resource management challenges. However, knowledge about the root causes of cross-sectoral coordination problems and how they can be transformed towards sustainability is still lacking. This paper conceptualises a WEF nexus case with the Networks of Action Situations approach combined with systems thinking. This approach allows a deep analysis about the root causes of coordination gaps, facilitates a joint understanding of the system dynamics to identify leverage points for transforming the WEF nexus towards sustainability, and to envision the impact of potential interventions on the network of action situations and its outcome. The study shows how the Network of Action Situations approach can be mobilized in combination with systems thinking to understand and support the transformative potential of complex resource systems. The value and the reciprocal benefits of the combined approach introduced is illustrated for a case in Switzerland, Europe. The results show a coordination gap between the different sectors and that not all sectors were considered equally. This leads to a prioritization of energy production over water-bound biodiversity and food production. The root causes for this outcome are a focus to mitigate climate change and an awareness for biodiversity but much less awareness for impacts of climate change on Swiss water bodies. The study identifies five deep leverage points for transformation, which are expected to ensure a shared systemic problem understanding and a more balanced coordination between different sectors resulting in sustainable and equitable provision and utilization of WEF resources.",Universität Bern,,,,,,,,Universität Bern,,Elke Kellner,,,,,,,,Elke Kellner,,Governance,Climate Change,Decision Making,,,,,,Identifying leverage points for transformation towards sustainability through the Networks of Action Situations approach combined with systems thinking,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63799&EventID=185
0,"The rise in the use of social media for political communication alongside traditional media outlets has led to questions about what types of political actors benefit from this new media environment. Much attention to date has been paid to populist parties, progressive social movements and far-right online subcultures like the ‘Alt-right’. There has been less focus however on contemporary far-right actors which operate outside of institutional politics and are not solely confined to the online realm. 

This paper fills this gap with a comprehensive analysis of the German Identitarian movement and its ‘metapolitics’. Emerging from previous attempts to refashion far-right politics for the post-war era, Identitarian ‘metapolitics’ is presented as a new media strategy that combines the provocation of press coverage through publicity stunts with the establishment of an online ‘counterculture’. The success of Identitarian metapolitics is assessed in the context of public and private regulation of ‘organised hate’. To this end, a novel dataset is created that spans over three years and combines over 500 articles published by three different media outlets with the social media activity of eleven accounts across six different platforms. 

The findings are that as regulation has increased press coverage of the Identitarian movement declined. Press coverage also increasingly emphasised the ‘anti-constitutional’ nature of the Identitarian campaign and covered less of their publicity stunts. For social media, regulation led to an increasing ‘personalisation’ of Identitarian metapolitics, where online activity became dominated by a single individual. 

These findings contribute to larger debates about how to safeguard democracy in light of extremist challenges orchestrated through the new media environment. In particular, this paper shows that political extremism is a cultural phenomenon and not only a question of electoral politics - a comprehensive strategy to strengthen democratic resilience must therefore acknowledge the joint responsibility of journalists and social media companies alongside the legislature.",Institute for Strategic Dialogue,,,,,,,,Institute for Strategic Dialogue,,Christian Schwieter,,,,,,,,Christian Schwieter,,Extremism,Identity,Internet,,,,,,Identitarian metapolitics in the new media environment: Tracing the rise and decline of a contemporary extreme right movement in Germany,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65548&EventID=185
0,"Western Europe is experiencing growing levels of political polarization between parties of the New Left and the Far Right. In many countries, the socio-structural foundations of this divide (class, education, residency) are by now so clear that many interpret this divide as a fully mobilized new electoral cleavage. 
However, cleavage formation also crucially requires processes of social closure and collective identity-formation: shared group identities are the “glue” of cleavage formation, as they translate grievances into political antagonisms. This translation is far from straightforward, as it depends on both bottom-up and top-down driven processes of group boundary-drawing. 
Our contribution relies on data from an original online survey fielded in the UK, Germany, France and Switzerland. Respondents have answered questions on their sense of belonging to a series of social groups, electoral preferences and socio-demographics. On this basis, we are able to show – observationally – how structural differences relate to both socio-economically (e.g. class, income) and socio-culturally (e.g. cosmopolitanism, lifestyle) connoted group identities, which divide New Left and Far Right voters. Our findings so far suggest that even though the new conflict is firmly rooted in socio-economic categories, it has predominantly been mobilized in terms of culturally connoted identities. In addition, both cross-national comparison (between early “realigners” France and Switzerland vs. recent “realigners” UK and Germany), as well as experimental priming treatments on the relative saliency of key issues allow us evaluating the extent to which group identities are being shaped by experiences of social closure (structure) and elite messages (agency).",University of Zurich,University of Zurich,University of Zurich,University of Zurich,,,,,University of Zurich,,Simon Bornschier,Silja Häusermann,Marco Steenbergen,Delia Zollinger,,,,,Simon Bornschier,,Cleavages,Political Parties,Identity,Comparative Perspective,Electoral Behaviour,,,,Identity Formation between Structure and Agency – How 'Us' and 'Them' Relates to Voting Behavior in Contexts of Electoral Realignment,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64020&EventID=185
0,"In the last parliamentary elections (2020), Alliance for Romanian Unity (AUR), a far-right populist party gained over nine percent of the votes, one month after the local elections where the score was slightly under one per cent. Their strategy was based on four pillars: family, fatherland, faith and freedom and the campaign included activism for the unification between Romania and Moldova, an opposition to progressive politics, criticism of foreign investments, and skepticism towards further European integration. Since then, the party and its leader, George Simion, reached over 20 percent of support and a second place in the polls. 

Starting from Fukuyama`s identity politics theory and Melendez & Kaltwasser work on political identities, this analysis explains the social and political background (after 2014 Presidential elections) and the main drivers of AUR rising. By using process tracing, the preliminary findings of our work show that the party was not the driving force, but the needed cohesion incentive that brought forward individuals and groups that belong to the same identity group. Using a populist and nationalist speech was sufficient for the party to gather, in a short time, significant support from those who felt unrepresented and shared an antiestablishment political identity.  Moreover, the crisis generated by Covid-19 pandemic played a significant role in the political mobilization of exclusive identities at different levels.",Babeş-Bolyai University,Babeş-Bolyai University,Babeş-Bolyai University,,,,,,Babeş-Bolyai University,,Marius Grad,Raluca Lutai,Claudiu Marian,,,,,,Marius Grad,,Civil Society,Contentious Politics,Nationalism,Identity,Mobilisation,Influence,,,Identity politics and mobilization in times of crisis.

0,"While people-centrism is one of the three defining characteristics in the ideational approach to populism, research on the empirical characteristics of the populist ingroup is scarce and the (constructed) identity of the people remains vague. Theoretically the populist ingroup is firstly defined by its homogeneity and unity and secondly by its opposition to other (out-)groups. This study aims to reveal the identity of groups which are addressed, when different political actors refer to the people and its antagonists. These group-references should be context-dependent, differing across party ideology and country. To identify, contextualize and systematize in- and outgroup(s) of populist political communication in election manifestos from political parties in Austria, Germany and Switzerland, this study makes use of word embeddings and, more specifically, embedding regression. This method not only allows for contextualization of specific terms that are used to refer to groups, but - by means of bootstrapping and permutation - also for the quantification of systematic differences in meaning and the associated uncertainty. The results show that the ingroups’ identity differs between right-wing populist parties and other parties, but the differences between outgroups’ identities are even more pronounced.  Consequently, the ingroup’s identity is mainly constructed ex negativo, through distinction from the outgroup. This not only adds to the growing research on populism in political texts with a focus on its hitherto neglected feature people-centrism, but also shows that word embeddings offer an avenue for further research on group-references in general.",WZB Berlin Social Science Center,,,,,,,,WZB Berlin Social Science Center,,Lisa Zehnter,,,,,,,,Lisa Zehnter,,Political Methodology,Populism,Communication,,,,,,Identity through distinction.

0,"While the functions of political parties in the democratic system have been extensively defined in the political science literature, it is still an open question whether citizens attribute the same roles to parties. Established theories of parties emphasize their linkage functions geared towards participation and representation or effectiveness. This article investigates where citizens locate parties in their democracies and whether their understanding of party functions is connected to their democratic values, preference for democratic institutions, and evaluations of the democratic systems. This investigation is based on original data from two surveys from 2019 and 2020—both run in the UK and Australia—which include novel survey instruments measuring citizens’ preferences for party behavior. The findings show that citizens either have strong preferences for participation and representation rooted in their democratic values or relate to party leaders and have tribal understandings of parties, which are unrelated to democratic values. Furthermore, effectiveness in the form of electoral success is of lesser importance than one would assume and unrelated to democratic values. These findings indicate, first, that citizens’ perspectives party functions are not as clearly delineated as they are in the party literature and, second, that the source of citizens’ discontent with parties can be rooted in democratic expectations or completely unrelated to them.",Universität Salzburg,Australian National University,,,,,,,Universität Salzburg,,Reinhard Heinisch,Annika Werner,,,,,,,Reinhard Heinisch,,Democracy,Political Parties,Party Members,Quantitative,,,,,"Ideological Beasts, Functional Organizations or a Mirror of ‘Me’?

0,"Several studies have investigated whether direct-democratic instruments match the procedural preferences of populist citizens (e.g. Jacobs et al. 2018; Mohrenberg et al. 2021; Zaslove et al. 2021; Trüdinger/Bächtiger 2022), an issue that features prominently both in the academic and public debate on dissatisfaction with representative democracy. It is an under-researched question, however, whether citizens with populist attitudes and/or populist vote intentions would actually participate in direct-democratic procedures when respective instruments are available in political practice. A discrepancy between attitudinal support and effective participation in direct-democratic voting would raise doubts whether populists’ satisfaction with democracy could be enhanced in the long run and a ‘preference’ and ‘representation gap’ be easily closed by introducing more direct-democratic instruments. Moreover, a discrepancy between attitudes and action might also indicate that support for direct democracy merely reflects opposition to the existing institutions of the representative system rather than a real demand for more participatory forms of democratic governance. Our paper addresses this question with the help of an online survey of 2,000 respondents in Germany. It adds two important aspects to current research. First, taking into account that populist beliefs can occur in combination with different core ideologies, we examine whether the effects of right-wing and left-wing populism are different. For instance, left-wing populism is associated with a more inclusionary conception of the ‘people’ than right-wing populism (Caiani and Graziano 2019). Left-wing populists might therefore be more open to subscribe to a different vision and practice of direct democracy. To test these expectations, we consider a wide range of orientations and issue positions (e.g. attitudes towards immigration, towards social policies) associated with left-wing and right-wing ‘host ideologies’. Second, we examine whether direct-democratic preferences and participation are actually affected by populist orientations or are rather driven by psychological motives related to apathy, alienation, and a lack of civic duty.",Universität Stuttgart,Universität Stuttgart,,,,,,,Universität Stuttgart,,Achim Hildebrandt,Eva-Maria Trüdinger,,,,,,,Eva-Maria Trüdinger,,Political Participation,Political Psychology,Populism,Political Ideology,Public Opinion,,,,"Ideology, Direct Democracy, and Populism: Preferences and Participation of Left-wing and Right-wing Populist Citizens",https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63283&EventID=185

Cross-national experimental research on trust and reciprocity has demonstrated that out-group status defined in terms of national membership significantly decreases propensity to cooperate; yet trust and reciprocity are also sensitive to social status.

Abstract

During the 1980s, 11,000 infants were adopted from Sri Lanka by European couples – 750 alone by Swiss couples(Langley, 2019). Poverty, the force of colonialism, lacking knowledge about and limited access to contraceptives, and strict national abortion laws in Sri Lanka had turned the country into a hotspot for inter-country adoption (ICA). In 2018, the government of Sri Lanka acknowledged that some babies adopted by foreigners in the 1980s were likely either bought or stolen from their biological parents (BBC Asia, 2018). Due to the high number of intercountry adoption, in 1993 a new legal regime on intercountry adoption was formed.1993 Hague Convention on Protection and Co-operation in respect of Intercountry Adoption was introduced to design an international framework for intercountry adoption and safeguard children in the intercountry adoption. However, the discussion on intercountry adoption within the international human rights agenda has been very limited. In light of the importance of international mechanisms in ensuring, promoting the human rights of internationally adopted children, this research aims to critically evaluate the loopholes in international human rights on inter-country adoption and try to understand how colonialism has shaped human rights in this regard.  The archival-based methodology will be used and the theoretical framework will be based on post-colonial understanding which will be used in tandem with specific case studies to answer the research questions.",Universität Bern,,,,,,,,Universität Bern,,Surangika Jayarathne,,,,,,,,Surangika Jayarathne,,Asia,Human Rights,Migration,Agenda-Setting,Capitalism,,,,Il/legal Inter-country Adoption between Sri Lanka and Switzerland: An Analysis of the International Human Rights and Politics of Colonialism,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64573&EventID=185
0,"Policy debates on how to design just and inclusive transition processes from fossil fuels to more sustainable means of natural resource use have reached the urban planning sector. Lately, voices calling for environmental, energy, and mobility justice resonate more deeply in the scholarly and public debate, pleading for an inclusive, intersectional and diverse re-setting of infrastructures, technologies, processes, and discourses. As a result, paying attention to the diverse needs of various actors in the urban settings - particularly vulnerable groups - and the inclusion of these diverse needs in policy designs and processes seems to become more and more important for sustainable city planning. At the same time, there is a lot of uncertainty about what just transformation should look like, which, in turn, is not conducive for the transition process. In this paper we follow up on these trends and elaborate on the question what visions about just transition unfold in the public debate. Theoretically we draw on the concept of imaginary from Science and Technology Studies (STS) as a heuristic device to identify and analyze different narratives when it comes to justice, inclusion and diversity in urban mobility transition processes. Empirically we carrying out a content analysis of policy documents of major stakeholders in the field of sustainable mobility transitions. First, we show that envisioning just transition elicits many different, partly heterogenic, narratives, which result from an under-specification of popular buzzwords such as ‘justice,’ 'inclusion' and 'diversity'. Second, we outline how just visions are translated into policies and how they are meant to be implemented. We conclude that it remains predominantly opaque what it means to design inclusive and just policies and whose needs need to be considered to account for the diverse set of (particularly vulnerable) actors in transition processes.",Westfälische Wilhelms-Universität Münster,,,,,,,,Westfälische Wilhelms-Universität Münster,,Antonia Graf,,,,,,,,Antonia Graf,,Environmental Policy,Gender,Energy Policy,,,,,,"Imagining Justice: analyzing visions of just, inclusive, and diverse transitions in urban mobility planning",https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65010&EventID=185
0,"Literature on the bases to Populist Radical Right (PRR) voting has posited a so-called ‘halo effect’, emphasising local conditions as a precursor to PRR support. Previous research has demonstrated support for the ‘ethnic competition’ hypothesis whereby higher levels of immigration in the immediate vicinity increase support for these parties. However, at finer spatial scales, immigrant and ethnically diverse communities may be less likely to vote Radical Right – possible evidence of an intergroup contact effect. Instead, ethnically homogeneous areas react to a perceived, adjacent threat from ethnic diversity, in this ‘halo effect’. Recently, a growing body of work has operationalised and test the ‘halo’ mechanism in France, Germany, Switzerland and Sweden in particular. In the UK, the theory has only been tested indirectly, using ecological data. Using  individual-level survey data from the 2017 SCoRE survey, combined with 2011 census data, and comparing with a baseline ecological model of 2015 local elections,  this paper builds better-specified aggregate and individual models of the halo effect, and tests them on UKIP propensity to vote and measures of ethnocentrism in England. It tests a number of alternative operationalisations of the halo, based upon distance and contiguity measures combined with measures of ethnic population density. It finds that, though local conditions have had an evident bearing on levels of PRR success in England, a direct halo mechanism is less easily identifiable than has been the case in other country studies, even if manifest at the aggregate level.",University of Leeds,,,,,,,,University of Leeds,,Jocelyn Evans,,,,,,,,Jocelyn Evans,,Nationalism,Populism,Electoral Behaviour,,,,,,"Immigrant proximity, ethnocentrism and Radical Right vote: a multi-level test of the halo effect in England",https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63290&EventID=185
0,"Over the last decades, the topic of how immigrant characteristics affect natives’ attitudes has received increasing attention by political scientists. This paper aims at contributing to this literature by examining the impact of immigrants’ personality profiles on natives’ preferences towards said immigrants in a novel, preregistered conjoint experiment based on representative survey data from the UK. We employ a more fine-grained and yet theoretically more well-rounded item inventory, namely the Big Five Aspect Scales (BFAS) to measure personality for both immigrants and respondents. While the psychological literature on personality has come to the consensus that personality can be sufficiently statistically reduced to five dimensions, the standard Big Five personality model lumps together a multitude of characteristics into a single trait. Although such characteristics may correlate strongly with each other, this does not necessarily imply that they are theoretically indistinct or even seen as capturing the same concept by ordinary people. In contrast, the BFAS splits up each of the Big Five personality traits into two more theoretically recognizable sub-traits, named aspects. This innovation does not only allow us to study the effects of personality with greater specificity, it also drastically improves on face validity. Overall, this paper’s main findings are three-fold: First, we show that immigrants’ personalities have a strong causal effect on natives’ propensities to admit immigrants into the United Kingdom. Most notably, we find that immigrants scoring higher on personality aspects Intellect, Industriousness, Enthusiasm, Compassion and Politeness, those who score lower on Volatility as well as with medium Assertiveness scores receive more favorable evaluations from British natives. These effects generally square well with the literature on immigration attitudes that has emphasized either economic or cultural explanations for differences in people’s attitudes. This conclusion is robust to simultaneously presenting survey respondents with information on immigrant characteristics that have been employed by traditional conjoint studies on immigration. Second, inspired by the related literature on matching individual differences for politicians and voters as well as the assortative mating literature on personality, we demonstrate that congruence in personality attributes between immigrants and natives can play a role in natives’ evaluations of immigrants. However, this finding is mostly confined to personality aspect Openness. In contrast, the data more generally suggest that natives scoring high in certain socially desirable traits often disproportionately punish immigrants who differ markedly in their personal predispositions on the basis of personality. This constitutes a considerable deviance from the personality congruence literature for other outcomes. Third, we do not find evidence for the idea that natives’ preferences on immigrants’ personalities have a compounding effect when said immigrants are signaled to hail from more culturally distinct countries compared to Britain. Our findings demonstrate the crucial relevance of personality psychology to scholars interested in studying why some immigrants are preferred by natives over others.",University of Oxford,The London School of Economics & Political Science,University of Oxford,,,,,,University of Oxford,,Nico Buettner,Sara Hobolt,James Tilley,,,,,,Nico Buettner,,Political Psychology,Immigration,Quantitative,Causality,Experimental Design,Public Opinion,Survey Experiments,Empirical,Immigrants' Personalities Strongly Affect Natives' Immigrant Preferences in the UK,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64313&EventID=185
0,"Over the past decades, Swedish politicians have initiated ambitious plans that aim to establish the country as ‘world class’ in terms of digitalisation, specifically with respect to public administration (N2018.14). This development also fits the Swedish self-image as a high-tech nation, with a strong belief in technological knowledge as a strategy for creating a prosperous nation (Petersén, 2019; Bergwik, S. et.al., 2014). Lately, this task has increasingly been linked to the so-called 4th industrial revolution – the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) and advanced robotics as part public and private organisations. This evolution is also increasingly documented in research which shows that data driven and automated systems that incorporate new technological developments in the areas of AI, algorithms and big data have rapidly become an integrated part of public governance and administration (Wirtz et.al 2019). 

While the presence of such systems in the context of governing is often communicated and understood as enhancing neutrality and accuracy in decision making, they also produce quite profound political challenges for conceiving and implementing a fair, inclusive, and impactful 21st century politics and public sector (Bucher, 2018). In this paper, we are interested in focusing on how knowledge is perceived and produced in these processes, as a strategy of investigating aspects of power in the implementation of new technologies in the public sector. Drawing on Foucault’s (1982) understanding of the knowledge-power nexus, we believe this approach to be a fruitful strategy to analyse patterns of privilege when new technology is to be implemented. Here, we also believe Sweden, with its long tradition of technology optimism in combination with a strong trust in the state, to be a crucial case. 

The aim of the paper is to analyse the different rationalities of knowledge that are activated when new technology is brought into a public organization. More specific, we are interested in both how knowledge is produced in policy, as well as is given meaning by different actors, like politicians, civil servants and different groups of professionals, including engineers. In addition, we will also focus on how knowledge is negotiated between private and public actors, as the number of private-public-partnerships are growing in this field. Empirically, we will make use of the National Network on AI and Public Authorities, where a growing number of Swedish public authorities are members, through which we both will collect policy material as well as find informants from both the public and the private sector.",Karlstad University,University of Gothenburg,Karlstad University,,,,,,Karlstad University,,Malin Rönnblom,Vanja Carlsson,Andreas Öjehag,,,,,,Malin Rönnblom,,Public Administration,Knowledge,Technology,,,,,,Implementing AI in the Swedish public sector – a struggle on knowledge?,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63945&EventID=185

0,"Based on ethnographic fieldwork in three different immigration detention centres in Belgium, I discuss the evolution of the practical implementation and organization of the detention policy. From an organizational perspective, I analyse the practical implementation as the result of specific configurations of power relations between the different categories of staff present in Immigraton Office (IO), which is the public administration in charge of the detention policy.
In this paper I will analyse three different configurations, which led to three different ideal-types of policy implementation in the different centres. These power struggles always revolved around what the different actors in these configurations considered to be the best way to run the centres. These visions and practices opposed visions of security and of humane treatment.

The paper contributes to existing literature in migration studies in three ways. First, of all it sheds light on detention practices in Belgium, which hitherto have not been studied through direct observations. Secondly, it further develops the theories of the “humanitarian border” developed by William Walters by analysing how the humanitarian reason has been integrated in very securitized settings such as detention facilities. Lastly, the analysis of configurations of power to understand policy implementation, makes it possible to compare such configurations across different (sub)fields of immigration studies. As such, this paper opens the discussion in two directions. First, I argue that this “configurational analysis” can settle debates on whether there is an “implementation gap” or whether immigration policies have been “securitized” or have become more liberal. Secondly, I argue it makes it possible to understand the differences between the subfields of border control and integration policies in which the rights of immigrants have a different weight.",Université catholique de Louvain,,,,,,,,Université catholique de Louvain,,Andrew Crosby,,,,,,,,Andrew Crosby,,Human Rights,Immigration,Policy Implementation,,,,,,Implementing immigration detention – a configurational analysis,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65219&EventID=185
0,"The EU’s AI strategic documents, particularly Communications and the White Paper of the European Commission (the EC), suggest that the EU has chosen to frame its approach towards Artificial Intelligence (AI) focused on normative and economic matters excluding defence and military aspects of AI (Franke, 2021; Franke, Torreblanca, 2021). At the same time, different EU security-related agencies (the EDA and the ENISA) and the EU programmes (the EDIDP and the EDF) have prioritized AI as a leading technology and an enabler in building Europe’s defence capabilities and developing this industry, where certain EU’s allocations have already been approved. Therefore, this inconsistency between different institutions and their priorities in involving defence and security elements in AI framing raise further questions on how the EU positions itself and perceives its power in a relation to AI which is already considered as a technological epicenter of geopolitics (Polyakova, Donahoe, 2020). Therefore, the research aims 1) to unravel where and how defence and broader security elements are involved into this complex AI framing, and 2) to elaborate on what this AI strategic discourse suggests for the EU as a power debate. The research is based on the Constructivist theoretical approach in the International Relations arguing that the social reality is based on constitutive and intersubjective knowledge where identities become important in understanding actors, their perception and relation to others (Adler, 2013). Methodologically, the research applies a discourse analysis with a focus on AI-related strategic documents by the EU institutions (the EC, the European Parliament, and the European Council), agencies (the EDA and the ENISA) and involved bodies (the High-Level Expert Group on AI in particular). Speeches, interviews or public comments on AI by the EU officials and decision makers will be also included into the scope of the defined EU’s AI discourse. Overall, the research is positioned to propose a more comprehensive picture of the complexity of the AI framing in the EU and continuous controversy on AI defence matters which should also reveal on how the EU wants to identify itself in the context of an intensifying global geopolitical competition on AI.",Vilnius University,,,,,,,,Vilnius University,,Justinas Lingevicius,,,,,,,,Justinas Lingevicius,,European Union,Security,Technology,,,,,,In Search for Military AI in the EU’s AI Strategic Discourse,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63946&EventID=185
0,"Inequality in political participation is a democratic challenge undermining the input legitimacy of our representative political systems. People from a marginalized socioeconomic background participate less in politics, which causes an underrepresentation of their interests. Furthermore, their position in society is often transmitted from generation to generation, causing a generation-long political underrepresentation. We study the reproduction of these inequalities by looking into students’ political home situations. We argue that a stimulating political home environment contributes to a child’s political socialization process. Since we study this with data from Flemish senior high school students, we focus on their feelings of internal political efficacy as they do not yet have voting rights and are not yet considered citizens with full political rights. Internal political efficacy is a good predictor of their future political behavior and fits well within Bourdieu and Passeron’s general reproduction theory since it taps into feelings of political entitlement.

As in all inequality debates, schools are often proposed as a holy grail to compensate for these inequalities. Tackling the imminent democratic challenges facing Western democracies today, citizenship education is encouraged to cultivate a new generation of active and democratic citizens. This citizenship education can, however, take on many different forms. In this paper, we research the moderating potential of citizenship education to compensate for the lack of a stimulating political home environment regarding internal political efficacy. We examine three distinct kinds of citizenship education: civic learning experiences in the classroom, an open classroom climate for discussion, and active student participation in school.

0,"The diffused and global nature of many digital contexts often renders regional representation invisible in digital activism research. This raises questions around whether marginalised communities are prominent in a field that is largely focussed on explorations of grassroots and counterpublic movements. In response to this issue, we conducted a mixed-methods systematic review of empirical journal articles (N=315) published on this topic. The corpus was created by running queries spanning 21 relevant keywords describing digitally enabled activism (e.g. digital activism, online activism) on the Scopus database. The final corpus consisted of 315 articles published between 2011 and 2018. This corpus was tested on a range of attributes including methodological approaches as well as factors for evaluating regionality with a focus on regionally disadvantaged communities (towards capturing the “Global South”). Coded categories included the choice of case study, its origin and location, the country of origin for lead authors, and the platforms being studied. While there was no expectation that all of these categories can necessarily reliably be coded on a regional or ethnic origin, this part of the coding was conducted towards capturing a general sense of diversity and spatial representation in digital activism research, above all in relation to the emergence of software-based digital methods. Results indicate that the majority of articles in the corpus focused on activist campaigns and groups in the Global North, with non-region-specific social media groupings such as hashtag publics particularly prominent. In comparison, there was a paucity of articles focused on case studies drawn from Global South countries. These trends were particularly evident in platform-based digital activism research, where data was sourced from sites like Facebook and Twitter. As such, there were correlations between a high percentage of Global North activists and the preponderance of certain social networking sites and their affordances in research (e.g. Twitter hashtag studies) as well as scholar bases in the Global North. This means that researchers may need to rethink (a) where and how disadvantaged and less visible activist groups are represented online, (b) what these hindrances mean for democratic participation, grassroots movements, and counterpublics, and (c) to what extent scholar and fieldwork location impact representativeness in research. The paper concludes by proposing a future research agenda for digital activism researchers which redresses this imbalance in favour of digital activism research from and within the Global South. Specifically, we argue that researchers should diversify their methodological approaches (e.g. towards capturing contextualised data) and the platforms they study in order to capture how digital activism operates in contexts outside the Global North.",Università degli Studi di Trento,University of Sheffield,,,,,,,Università degli Studi di Trento,,Suay Melisa Ozkula,Paul Reilly,,,,,,,Suay Melisa Ozkula,,Globalisation,Political Methodology,Internet,Methods,Social Media,Higher Education,Activism,,In search of the Global South: regional representation in digital activism research,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64544&EventID=185
0,"Multiculturalism understood as the accommodation of minority groups, e.g. through group rights, exemptions, or policies of recognition, have been discussed in political philosophy for over three decades. Many prominent theoretical defenses of multiculturalism are applications of more general liberal, libertarian, democratic or egalitarian theories to specific issues related to diversity, e.g. Will Kymlicka, Chandran Kukathas, Iris Young, Seyla Benhabib. However, not all theories of multiculturalism are like this. The so-called Bristol School of Multiculturalism seems to be an example of a different kind of defense of multiculturalism. Its prominent representatives, such as Bhikhu Parekh and Tariq Modood, stress that their multiculturalism does not presuppose liberal principles and is not, more generally, an application of more abstract principles. Parekh and Modood rather stress the actual claims making of minority groups in specific societies and the need for intercultural dialogue about these claims. This raises questions about how we should understand such defenses of multiculturalism, which Modood on several occasions has labelled as ‘political multiculturalism’. The question is in what sense defenses of multiculturalism like those of the Bristol School of Multiculturalism can be said to be ‘political’ and what this means for the normative policy proposals arrived at on this basis. One can interpret what might characterize ‘political multiculturalism’ as a type of theoretical defense of multiculturalism in several different ways. Some interpretations concern the subject matter of the view defended, but several ways of understanding political multiculturalism interprets the ‘political’ in methodological terms. Despite Parekh and Modood’s rejection of liberalism as an overarching doctrine, there are ways in which their defense of multiculturalism is political in a sense similar to Rawls’s political liberalism. Their rejection of attempts to derive multiculturalism from abstract principles is furthermore similar to the political realist criticism of political philosophy as applied ethics. This leads to the further question whether political multiculturalism resembles political realism in ways that are more positive as well and what this might imply for the normative status of the resultant policy proposals.",University of Roskilde,,,,,,,,University of Roskilde,,Sune Lægaard,,,,,,,,Sune Lægaard,,Political Theory,Methods,Ethics,Liberalism,Normative Theory,,,,In what ways is political multiculturalism political?,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63221&EventID=185
0,"Germany is conceived as the ‘ideal-type’ militant democracy, but until the emergence of the AfD in 2013 it was an exceptional case lacking an electorally successful right-wing populist party. Unlike most former targets of militant responses, the AfD accepts rules of the liberal democracy. This raises the central question addressed in the article: How does the emergence of an electorally successful populist right-wing party affect practices of German militant democracy? Data on initiatives opposing the AfD between 2013 and 2020 shows that while the judicial, rights-restricting pillar of the militant model is limited, it remains strong in political and civil society responses. In addition, the AfD’s opponents continuously navigate between tolerant and intolerant modes of engagement, depending on actor type and political context. This pattern of opposition forms the basis of an ‘adapted-militancy’ model of initiatives opposing populist parties (IOPPs). The article argues that two types of political ‘learning’ can explain the evolution of militant democracy in Germany: first, learning from the expectation of their own respective voters and from the institutional constraints encountered in the process of delivering responses to the AfD, and second, adaptation to AfD’s changing strategies. The research suggests that the populist message and electoral success requires that the AfD’s opponents become – at least, in appearance – increasingly tolerant of the intolerant.",University of Wrocław,,,,,,,,University of Wrocław,,Bénédicte Laumond,,,,,,,,Bénédicte Laumond,,Democracy,Extremism,Populism,Policy Change,,,,,Increasing toleration for the intolerant? ‘Adapted militancy’ and German responses to Alternative für Deutschland,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64452&EventID=185
0,"It is well-known that incumbents often enjoy an advantage in elections, even at the level of local legislatures (Dahlgaard 2016). A vast majority of the literature finds an incumbent advantage in plurality systems, while the evidence for the advantage in proportional representation systems is mixed (Jankowski and Müller 2021).
In this paper, I ask if incumbents maintain their advantage when the electoral system changes. So far, this question remains unanswered due to the relative stability of electoral systems and limited opportunities for causal inference. Specifically, I test whether incumbents elected under proportional rule maintain their personal advantage if they need to compete for re-election in a majoritarian system (and vice versa).
I exploit a series of electoral system changes in local elections in Poland as natural experiments. In five municipality elections in Poland in the years 2002-2018, the arbitrary threshold of 20,000 inhabitants divided municipalities into different electoral rules. This allows to apply the sharp Regression Discontinuity Design (RDD). I match incumbents in over 2,400 municipalities with candidates running in the next election and compare the electoral results of incumbents running in municipalities 'just below' and 'just above' the threshold.
I find that incumbents elected via a proportional representation system struggle to be re-elected after the system is changed to single member districts. The system change does not substantially affect the share of incumbents who run in the next election, nor the share of votes received by incumbents. However, the incumbents do not sort to avoid competition with other incumbents. In effect, more than one incumbent runs in the same district twice as often where previously the proportional system had been applied than in municipalities where the plurality rule had been in place. By force, less of such incumbents can be re-elected when they compete against each other.
I do not find similar effect in terms of turnover after the system is changed from majoritarian to proportional with gender quota. Also, I do not find any difference between plurality and proportional system, and between majoritarian and proportional system with gender quota. It is an important contribution, since settings allowing for a direct and causal comparison of electoral systems are scarce. Finally, contrary to the expectations based on the literature on gender and age composition of legislative bodies, the system changes do not affect the demographic composition of municipality councils.
In sum, the findings of this paper point to the limited impact of electoral systems on legislative turnover and composition of local legislatures. In turn, they encourage further studies on the effects of electoral system changes.

0,"With the aim to promote international mobility, Spain has been undertaking active action on various fronts, the national and international level and within the EU. At the national level, Spain implemented in 2013 the Entrepreneurs Act aiming to attract talent, investment and boost the economy while removing bureaucratic hurdles and time consuming requisites. This scheme covers investors, intra-corporate transferees, highly qualified professionals, researchers, entrepreneurs, and family dependents.  
At the international and EU level, in addition to the different EU labour migration related directives (e.g. Blue Card Directive 2009/52, Intra-Corporate Transfer Directive 2014/66, Single Permit Directive 2011/98) in place, Spain is a signatory of the major Free Trade agreements in place such as the EU-Canada Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) and the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement. These agreements intend to affirm the commitment to a harmonized migration regulation of certain migrants’ categories by the EU Member States. In the same vein, the current Spanish national regulation is being adapted to enhance benefits and improve requirements so as to attain this goal under the Entrepreneurs’ Act. 
The aim of this paper is to understand national regulations covering the requirements established in these trade agreements and the barriers and benefits when applying these categories, this paper presents a practitioners analyses of the requisites, processing time and validity of permits with a focus on independent professionals and intra-corporate transferees, which are novel migratories models not involving being hired locally.

0,"This paper investigates the complexities of 'indigeneity' as they obtain in multiply colonised contexts by focusing on the relationship between indigeneity and post/coloniality in the case of Kashmir. After a brief canvassing of the Kashmir conflict as typically perceived (simplistic India-Pakistan territorial dispute), I shift focus to Kashmir Valley (epicentre of the conflict in Indian-administered region) and analyse the ways in which identity and indigeneity are set to work in this post/colonial conflict. I argue how the roots of Kashmir conflict are Eurocentric colonial, but its contemporary manifestation demonstrates the colonial exercise of power by post-colonial states. Hence, the Kashmir imbroglio today is post/colonial. There is an overwhelming body of evidence about the ways in which 'native' Kashmiri Valley population -- both Hindu and Muslim -- have suffered multidimensional trauma at the hands of the military and militant forces both, yet these injuries are never comprehended together but are always politically articulated in a segmented manner through what I call ""discourse of competing victimhoods"" (DCV). DCV operates through Kashmiri Muslims (KMs) referring to their killings, enforced disappearances, rapes by Indian forces in response to the Kashmiri self-determination struggle, and Kashmiri Hindus (Kashmiri Pandits, KPs) referring to their forced displacement, killings, rapes by militants as a strategy of an anti-India Islamist movement. DCV can range from political use of selective histories and memories to denial of the extent of suffering on either side by the other. I demonstrate how this polarisation is linked to complex claims to indigeneity on each side. The KPs are held up as the original indigenous inhabitants of Kashmir Valley going back millennia. Disputing this, KMs refer to the Central Asian originating Afghan and Mughal dynasties that ruled the region at different times prior to the British sale of the territory and its peoples in a 19th century treaty. The Indian state, especially in its 21st century Hindutva (Hindu nationalist) version, sees the KPs as the indigenous Kashmiris whose suffering justifies repression of KMs. In fact, so much so that violent Hindu fundamentalist views and actions in contemporary India are widely justified by the rhetorical question: 'What about Kashmiri Pandits (KPs)?'. Here, the fate of indigenous KPs is a question that answers itself and justifies any colonial manoeuvre of the post/colonial state. On the other hand, KMs refer to the constant repression (curtailed rights, internet and media censorships, intimidation, surveillance, public humiliation, identity erasures) that achieved new proportions with India abrogating autonomy of the region in a constitutional coup in August 2019. In recent years, land and domicile laws have been changed to allow Indians easy access to the region. Here, KM fear of demographic settler-colonial style change with the Indian influx makes for emphasis on KM indigeneity claims as the inhabitants who are being erased. DCV ensures that different ideas of indigeneity are used in parallel in support of varying emancipatory goals. I conclude by reflecting upon what decolonial pathways might mean in such post/colonial conflicts with complex indigeneities.",University of Westminster,,,,,,,,University of Westminster,,Nitasha Kaul,,,,,,,,Nitasha Kaul,,Ethnic Conflict,India,Nationalism,Political Theory,Political Violence,Identity,Memory,Political Cultures,Indigeneity and Competing Victimhoods in Post/Colonial Conflict,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65425&EventID=185
0,"Scholarship in critical International Relations has increasingly revealed the Eurocentric and colonial roots and ramifications of the paradigmatic understanding of sovereignty. Both in public debate and mainstream academic literature, sovereignty has become associated with political models, ontologies, and values originated in the Western hemisphere and Euromodernity. What is more, the concept was historically framed by the colonial invasions and deployed as an instrument of colonisation itself. As a result of the naturalisation of a racial and civilizational divide within the doctrine of sovereignty, it was simultaneously asserted by settlers and colonial powers while denied to and rendered impossible for indigenous peoples. More than a semantic twist, this was key in enabling and justifying indigenous dispossession. Today still, the prevailing international legal order built on colonial legacies deems indigenous peoples to be non-sovereign, a legal fiction often reinforced by national courts. Thus, sovereignty has been appropriated by the West, both politically/materially through colonisation processes and conceptually by conflating the concept with the particular Euromodern conception. Paradoxical as it may seem, sovereignty nonetheless remains an appealing ideal for many colonised peoples, one towards which they maintain “affective attachments” fuelling their contemporary politics. More particularly, the indigenous international movements of the mid-20th century onwards represented a significant intervention in the discursive politics surrounding the concept. Many indigenous activists and scholars, especially in settler colonial contexts, actively re-appropriated the language of sovereignty to encapsulate and advance indigenous political aspirations. Since then, this indigenous re-appropriation has been fraught with debates over its adequacy, its complexities and its potential pitfalls. 

This paper explores how Māori, Aotearoa/New Zealand’s indigenous people, navigate their relations to the concept of sovereignty in their contemporary political discourses pursuing self-governance. Sovereignty is arguably one of the most contested political terrains in the Māori-Crown relations since the signing of the treaty of Waitangi. According to the English interpretation, Māori ceded their sovereignty to the British Crown in 1840. However, “Māori sovereignty” became a rallying cry for Māori activism and protest in the 1980s and 1990s. More recently, the Waitangi Tribunal asserted in its conclusions to the Te Paparahi o te Raki inquiry (WAI1040) that Māori did not cede their sovereignty by signing the treaty. This paper starts by briefly introducing the Western/Euromodern appropriation of the language of sovereignty and the place of this concept in state-indigenous relations in Aotearoa. It then discusses indigenous scholarship originated in settler colonial contexts in order to map its engagement with the idea of sovereignty. This will reveal an ambivalence towards the concept oscillating between rejection and rearticulation. Building on interviews conducted with Māori leaders, academics, and activists, as well as on WAI1040 claimants’ submissions, this paper then delves into the concrete conceptual strategies deployed by Māori today in their search for self-determining governance. Finally, I propose to use Yarimar Bonilla’s notion of “strategic entanglement” as a lens to understand these socio-political Māori actors’ relation to the concept of sovereignty, and possibly that of indigenous peoples beyond Aotearoa.",University of Aberdeen,,,,,,,,University of Aberdeen,,Valentin Clavé-Mercier,,,,,,,,Valentin Clavé-Mercier,,Contentious Politics,International Relations,Critical Theory,Political Activism,Empirical,,,,Indigenous Peoples and the Language of Sovereignty: Strategic Entanglement in Māori Politics,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65424&EventID=185
0,"The energy transition is part of a wider industrial revolution (Westphal, 2021); gaining geopolitically from renewable energy, therefore, requires advances in industry, manufacturing, and technology. It is those advances that determine whether a country is in a position to take or keep the role of a technology supplier (Lachapelle et al., 2017), and thus to win geopolitically from new energy technologies – or not (Scholten et al., 2020). Engaging successfully in the new industrial competition depends on the ability of individual states to provide the industry with favorable conditions such as a suitable policy framework (Sen and Ganguly, 2017), R&D, or access to funding (Yergin, 2020). Existing path-dependencies may be problematic in that regard (Overland, 2021). In turn, this involves the possibility for widely different development paths and hence a risk for global equity and stability (Eicke and Goldthau, 2021; Bazilian et al., 2019).

Using different analytical perspectives, scholars such as Smith Stegen (2018), Overland et al. (2019), and Bazilian et al. (2019) have assessed which (type of) countries might win, and which could lose geopolitically from the energy transition. We aim at contributing to this literature (see Sattich and Huang, forthcoming) with a systematic analysis of the framework conditions required to generate development in the industries related to renewable energy. To come to such an analysis, we draw on Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA). This method is case-based in the sense that it emphasizes the value of analyzing individual cases. In terms of operationalization, this means that cases are described as a) causal conditions and b) outcomes. The approach is comparative in the sense that it enables the researcher to explore similarities and differences across comparable cases. In our analysis, each country is understood as a specific configuration of conditions determining industrial competitiveness. By cross-comparing a set of countries with above-average performance in terms of industrial competitiveness, we hope to identify different combinations of conditions suited to promote growth in the renewable energy industry. One of the strengths of the QCA method in that regard is the integration of qualitative and quantitative research traditions which allows us to use qualitative as well as quantitative data to determine whether a certain condition or outcome is present or absent, depending on the individual definition.

0,"Since 2020, governments around the world have been designing and implementing rapid responses to the pandemic, which are of great significance to the improvement of citizens’ satisfaction with COVID-19 response. In this effort, they are faced with some corruption risks which may undermine the effectiveness of responses. Indeed, breaches of anticorruption standards, including surcharges, speculation, collusion, cutting corners in procurement processes, and even politicians taking advantage of the crisis to increase their private benefits, have been recorded in various countries during the COVID-19 pandemic, including Europe. Based on a mass survey from Portugal, collected during the peak of the third wave (December/January 2021) and at the end of the third wave (April/May 2021), in this study the influencing factors of citizens’ satisfaction with COVID-19 pandemic response were analyzed with regression strategy. The results reveal that the data fit the model well, and all the hypotheses formulated in this study were supported. Among the factors that were found to directly affect citizens’ satisfaction with pandemic response (SPR) in Portugal, tolerance towards corruption in exceptional contexts (TtC-COVID) has positive impact on satisfaction, followed by political trust and lockdown break. The political orientation and the pandemic fatigue have negative impact on SPR. The sociodemographic variables that have significant impacts on the latent variables were also explored. Regarding the main findings, citizens who were more tolerant towards corruption tended to have higher satisfaction with COVID-19 response. Moreover, the improvement of PT was found to significantly increase SPR. Finally, citizens more right political-oriented were found to have lower SPR.

0,"How do informal civil society organizations, such as community assemblies and committees affect resource distribution across sub-national units in decentralized systems? Previous literature has outlined different mechanisms how these civil society institutions affect distributive politics: they could serve a brokerage function in exchanging funds for concentrated community vote, they might help to mobilize community support for developing projects or they might serve as mobilizing tools for small-scale protests demanding discretionary resources. This paper specifies political incentives underlying these distribution strategies, and tests these mechanisms rigorously against each other with village-level data from rural Mexico. I argue that when sub-municipal localities and their leaders have the capacity to mobilize their citizens, they prefer contentious action over vote concentration, as the latter is inherently risky for marginalized communities. I also argue that mobilizing community contributions attracts resources only under very low levels of state capacity, where municipal and state level politicians lack the ability to implement projects themselves.

0,"Most global economic institutions are dealing with contestation not only from (non-)member states but also from civil society. While it can seem as if protests only result in a viscous circle of increasing security measures, most economic institutions have actually started to open up to civil society (compare Tallberg et al. 2013). Evolving from a culmination of violent contestation in the 1990s, civil society participative formats, often in the form of so-called Dialogue Forums, have been implemented with the hope of making an institution (appear) more democratic. Although (scarce) research on these forums questions their intentions and impact (Deitelhoff 2012; Hack 2019), and practitioners have boycotted them in the past, the format is flourishing. 
While legitimacy research often focusses on states and bureaucracies, the effort poured into these outreach formats clearly illustrates that institutions take civil society seriously as a legitimacy constituency - Warranting further research that accounts for civil society as legitimacy audience in its multiplicity and furthermore examines not only civil society demands from international organisations but more so expectations that IOs might have of civil society. Therefore, this paper analyses the G20’s relationship, expectations and perception of civil society over time, comprehending civil society not as a monolithic but as a diverse legitimacy constituency within the international realm. 
The G20 outreach process takes a specific form, in that there is not only one central Dialogue Forum, but eight officially acknowledged (as of 2021), thematically differentiated, and self-organising Engagement Groups. These Groups, started with/ by the business community (B20) in 2010, have provided an increasingly formalising space of engagement and criticism. Additionally, there is a number of unofficial groups as well as engagement with CSOs outside of this process. Thus, the G20 maintains relations with various sectors of civil society in different stages of formalisation. A further dimension is added by the yearly rotating presidency, meaning that G20-civil society relations have to be newly negotiated every year.
The paper’ analysis of G20-civil society relations will be mostly text-based, using official G20 declarations and documents as well as social media communication for content analysis.

0,"The EU (European Union) has been a critical actor in supporting in establishing rights based asylum governance since the WW2. Member states have been safe havens for thousands of forced migrants from different parts of the world. Europeanization processes, on the other hand, contributed to establishing formal asylum governance in close neighborhood. Still, the Union has lost significantly from such pioneering role especially after “the migration crisis” in 2015. With its primary emphasis in keeping “the Fortress Europe” safe, the Union disregards the decay of fundamental rights and liberties. Non-binding instruments agreements take place of established rules and regulations. 
A strand of literature addresses political ideology as a key element in shaping stances on asylum governance (Aydemir, 2022; Van Gorp, 2005; Van Prooijen et.al., 2017).

Parliamentary questions are analyzed for opening room to express individual preferences most freely when compared with other parliamentary activities.

0,"There is a strong consensus among scientists that climate change is mostly caused by human behavior but the causes of climate change and the appropriate means for reducing greenhouse gas emissions remain under considerable debate. Research has shown that network structures in information exchange that confirm actors’ pre-existing beliefs can lead to echo chambers, where like-minded actors exclusively share information with each other. This can cause problems in decision making by contributing to the spread of misinformation, and by promoting extremist beliefs and distrust between actors holding different beliefs. Belief similarity between connected actors can be the result of either belief homophily or policy learning. Belief homophily and echo chambers have been found to be more common among individuals who have strong political beliefs, but this has not been studied at the organizational level.

In Germany, the regional (‘Länder’) governments have been responsible for most political measures.

0,"Forced migration heightens all forms of gendered injustices. For women and girls, health, and sexual and reproductive health in particular, is one of the bleakest experiences of gendered harms that affect their rights, dignity, and freedoms during displacement and beyond. With a focus on South-South displacement from Venezuela to Brazil, this paper explores gendered risks and vulnerabilities during and because of migration, as well as the infrastructure of protection that exists to safeguard their right to health and wellbeing in the host country. We argue that any gender-sensitive infrastructure of protection should redress immediate violations to the health harms and vulnerabilities that female fleers face in ways that enable their (long-term) opportunities to rebuild the social standing and dignity that has been lost. Accordingly, we identify protection gaps revealed in the contradictions between existing normative and institutional frameworks of protection, and how those are enacted in practice. We argue protection gaps reproduce gendered forms of violence and conditions of protracted insecurity and indignity for (forced) migrant women and girls. The contribution of this article is two-fold. First, it contributes to gender and migration accounts of the ‘feminisation’ of migration by adding a perspective of human dignity as an approach to the gender-health-migration nexus, risks and harms.

0,"Prevailing approaches to anticolonial political thought have focused on the high politics of anticolonial statesmen, whose actions came to an end during the neoliberal counterrevolution in the 1970s. The end of the anticolonial moment coincided with the emergence of the global environmental movement and global consciousness of the earth’s finitude. This dominant historical lens has led to a treatment of anticolonial and environmental political thought as chronologically – and hence conceptually – distinct phenomena. This paper turns to vital environmental anticolonial movements and thinkers who challenge this prevailing framework, unearthing from their writings a distinctive account of political freedom that urgently speaks to the dilemmas of today. 

I treat both anthropocentric environmental degradation and anticolonial political action as mutually reinforcing events that gave rise to an otherwise neglected discourse about the meaning of unfreedom in the wake of impending environmental collapse. Bringing together the political thought of two early mid-20th century non-elite anticolonial actors Bermudian Black Power grassroots organizer, environmental scientist and engineer Pauulu Kamarakafego and Garveyist activist Audley Moore, both of whom were contemporaries, I show how congruences across these two seemingly “minor” political actors and contexts highlighted a nascent idea of futural repair that took seriously what I call the already present and impending “structural master” of environmental degradation that acted in tandem with, but distinct from, economic domination on its own. This paper tracks the inherited environmental worlds of Kamarakafego and Moore by providing a historical reconstruction of British and French agricultural colonial projects and the ways in which those porjects were inspired by and in part inspired American agricultural mass agricultural projects that laid way for the displacement and dispossession of both Black and Indigenous communities at the turn of the 20th century.  Drawing on archival resources, I show how Kamarakafego’s environmental agenda focused on how movements for anticolonial self-determination across the Caribbean, Australia, Latin America and Africa could center solutions for moving beyond ecologically extractivist practices to propped up popular plans for independence both before and during the neoliberal counter-revolution of the 1970s. Moore’s organizing work in the National Emancipation Proclamation Centennial Observance Committee (NEPCOC), meanwhile, underscored her commitment to imagining reparations through the prism of land tenure as well as monetary payouts. Moore’s work on reparations when it comes to land tenure underscores, I argue, a commitment to a “land back” approach to dealing with the consequences of the continuing unfreedom brought on by environmental degradation and its sibling counterpart, economic domination.",Cornell University,,,,,,,,Cornell University,,Alexia Alkadi-Barbaro,,,,,,,,Alexia Alkadi-Barbaro,,Environmental Policy,Political Theory,Critical Theory,Climate Change,Political Activism,,,,Inherited Worlds of Environmental Anticolonialism c. 1890-1950,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64862&EventID=185
0,"A new form of campaign financing emerged in the Spanish party system developed by Podemos party: microcredits. By using digital technologies, Podemos microcredits are electoral funding initiatives based on civil loans from the party’s activists and sympathisers (at zero percent interest rate). The party returns the loans, once it receives the State subsidies for elections, normally one year later. Despite the current Spanish electoral and financing regulation does not specifically contemplate this type of campaign financing, it has been used since 2015.

Other parties have also joined Podemos in using microcredits, including smaller or regional left parties (e.g. United Left, ERC, Más País) and, notably, the Socialist party (PSOE). Opposite to Podemos, the Socialists have implemented them with a different perspective. Indeed, PSOE has granted a competitive interest rate and has broadened the scope of this financial innovation, including party’s processes not linked to electoral campaigns.

Thus, we categorise two types of microcredits, with different rationale, objectives, and uses. What are the characteristics of the two microcredits? Why have they been implemented?

0,"In this paper we address the ways in which the institutional complexity of polycentric global climate governance enables or constrains political agency. In doing so, we seek to contribute to the emerging and much-needed dialogue between the study of global governance and the study of social complexity. 
In a first step, we outline why that dialogue is needed – concretely, how integrating tenets, methods and insights from complexity sciences can help us to conceptualise and analyse institutional complexity as a structural characteristic of polycentric global governance that has a profound impact on spaces for political agency.
We then argue that the degree of political agency that actors have under institutional complexity depends inter alia upon their core organizational and epistemic qualities, including, for example, a central position or brokerage function in a policy network, or a relatively generalist and flexible knowledge of the governance system in question. 
We illustrate these organizational and epistemic qualities of political actors, and the implications they may have, with examples from global climate governance. These examples include inter alia the shifting spaces for agency of the UN climate secretariat, pluri- and minilateral climate arrangements, country governments and NGOs as well as legitimacy audiences. 
We show for these contexts how certain organisational and epistemic qualities may facilitate new forms of power (e.g., nodal power in a network), techniques (e.g. shopping amongst institutional alternatives) and legitimacy (e.g., peer or mutual accountability) for navigating institutional systems that cast uncertainty and sometimes unpredictability on actors.",Lunds Universitet,Erasmus University Rotterdam,Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam,,,,,,Lunds Universitet,,Fariborz Zelli,Lasse Gerrits,Oscar Widerberg,,,,,,Fariborz Zelli,,Environmental Policy,Governance,Climate Change,,,,,,Institutional Complexity and Political Agency in Polycentric Governance: Integrating Tenets and Insights from Global Governance and Social Complexity Research,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63432&EventID=185
0,"Producing enough healthy food for a growing world population within planetary boundaries is a global challenge. Various new technologies for resource-efficient and sustainable food production are currently under development. One promising approach are modular production systems that combine the production of e.g., plants, fish and insects in controlled environments to create closed material cycles. Such controlled-environment systems could then also be located in urban areas. However, establishing food production systems in urban contexts meets institutional challenges because legal frameworks and planning practices are often not prepared to accommodate food production, which is typically assigned to rural areas. Few studies so far have analysed the institutional framework for urban food production systems. This paper aims to address this gap. Based on an institutional analysis we have analysed the institutional framework at three different locations (Berlin, London and Singapore), using a content analysis of relevant scientific and grey literature and 36 semi-structured expert interviews. The results show that in each location a variety of different formal and informal institutions affect the implementation and acceptance of controlled-environment food production systems. The relevant institutions reflect responses to past and present challenges to the food sector, as well as a range of stakeholder needs and power structures in the three locations. The different institutional frameworks point towards very diverse challenges and opportunities for the realization and acceptance of controlled-environment food production systems. None of the three locations provides a comprehensive regulatory framework for controlled-environment food production systems. Singapore’s government stimulates the development and implementation of urban food production systems through different political strategies, guidelines and financial initiatives, whereas controlled-environment food production systems receive little attention in the institutional frameworks of London and Berlin. However, a high degree of regulatory uncertainty and bureaucratic barriers encumber the implementation of controlled-environment food production systems in all three locations. The paper analyses the impact of financial initiatives and supportive political strategies for urban food production on encouraging local businesses to implement controlled-environment food production systems. It also looks at the acceptance of high-tech food production systems by local consumers and residents. The findings suggest that the successful establishment of controlled-environment food production systems in urban areas requires a comprehensive and integrated regulatory framework that considers the specifics of 1) the highly intensive production processes, 2) the variegated types of products and 3) the urban location.",Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin,Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin,,,,,,,Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin,,Victoria Dietze,Peter H.

0,"Researchers in policy studies agree that public policies often change gradually and that country-specific historical trajectories are important. One popular version of this argument holds that historical policy decisions cast long shadows as they create feedback effects that institutionalize public policies towards stable institutional equilibria that tend to evolve slowly. Nevertheless, we know much less about how political legacies impact on major policy change, especially under conditions of uncertainty.

In this paper, I argue that historical political institutions shape major policy changes even after their replacement. Not only do institutional legacies create feedback effects that lock in regime stability, but they also become heuristics for how decision-makers design a major policy change under uncertainty in the future. This is especially the case if decision-makers need to implement a major policy change under uncertainty. To examine this argument, I study the policy responses to the COVID-19 crisis and analyze the link between regime past and lock-down policies during times of crisis. I hold that countries with a past of authoritarian government are much more likely to impose stringent anti-crisis measures and restrictions on citizens' liberties compared to countries with a democratic legacy. Against the background of a major crisis, institutional legacies of past regimes are part of decision-makers’ “fast and frugal” heuristics, which shape decision-making.

To empirically buttress my argument, I use multilevel regression models and show that countries with a past of authoritarian government are more likely to implement restrictive measures against COVID-19, regardless of infection rates and deaths, available hospital beds, efficiency of government, decentralization, the current state of democracy as well as other control variables. Furthermore, the paper explores whether such a transference of institutional policy contexts might spill over beyond specific policy practices. Therefore, I compare the development of democracy before and after the ""Spanish Flu'' of 1918-1920, in using interrupted time series models. My findings suggest that it is unlikely that this historic pandemic contributed significantly to the decline of democracy.

The results of this research indicate that past rather than present regime forms explain lockdown stringency. In addition, anti-pandemic policies do not seem to cause a decline of democracy but rather reinforce pre-existing trends in regime development. More generally, this research contributes to policy analysis by demonstrating that institutional legacies contribute to major policy changes even after their replacement.",Université de Lausanne,,,,,,,,Université de Lausanne,,Philipp Trein,,,,,,,,Philipp Trein,,Democracy,Government,Public Administration,Public Policy,Social Policy,Policy Change,Policy-Making,,Institutional legacies and major policy change,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64593&EventID=185
0,"Multistakeholder global governance has risen in recent decades as a major alternative to old-style multilateralism, particularly in the fields of environment, food, health, corporate accountability, and the Internet. In contrast to multilateral organizations, which develop global cooperation among nation-states, multistakeholder regimes assemble representatives of various sectors that ‘have a stake’ in a particular problem (e.g., academe, business, civil society, governments, and technical experts). Multistakeholder initiatives often present themselves as more effective, democratic and fair than multilateralism. Yet how far have these multistakeholder initiatives been able to attract legitimacy: on what grounds and to whom? In particular, how far do legitimacy beliefs toward multistakeholder regimes share the same institutional sources that other research has found to count for multilateralism? Or does legitimacy work differently in multistakeholder global governance? This paper examines these questions in relation to one of the leading global multistakeholder bodies, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN). ICANN is a particularly interesting case to study these questions, given this multistakeholder scheme’s size and careful attention to institutional design, often presenting itself as a model multistakeholder apparatus for others to emulate. Moreover, ICANN is important. Overseeing several key technical functions of the global Internet infrastructure, it plays a crucial role in making possible a single global Internet. Drawing on mixed-methods survey interviews conducted with some 500 individuals across all parts of the ICANN regime, this paper explores the relationship between their assessments of institutional qualities on the one hand and their legitimacy beliefs toward ICANN on the other. First, we are interested in finding out what institutional qualities participants find important for ICANN. Second, we seek to determine how far participants see these institutional qualities realized in practice. Third, we aim to identify how far legitimacy in ICANN is rooted in perceptions of its purpose, procedure, and performance. To this end, we combine statistical analysis of closed-ended survey questions with a qualitative content analysis of open-ended responses.
We present three key findings:
1.	In terms of principles, participants in ICANN generally attach more importance to technocratic performance and democratic and fair procedure than to democratic and fair performance. Respondents also find it between ‘quite’ and ‘very’ important that ICANN delivers on technocratic procedure. 
2.	In terms of practice, participants in ICANN are generally most satisfied with the institution’s purpose, technocratic performance, and democratic procedures. Participants give comparatively lower scores to ICANN’s delivery on technocratic and fair procedures as well as on democratic and fair outcomes. 
3.	Regarding links between institutional qualities and legitimacy beliefs, participants in ICANN who are more satisfied with several aspects of the organization’s purpose, adherence to fair, democratic, and technocratic procedures, and ability to deliver technocratic outcomes generally are more likely to have high confidence in ICANN.",Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam,"Departments of Political Science and Public Administration, Universiteit Leiden",,,,,,,Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam,,Hortense Jongen,Jan Aart Scholte,,,,,,,Hortense Jongen,,International Relations,Global,Internet,Mixed Methods,Survey Research,,,,Institutional Sources of Legitimacy in Multistakeholder Global Governance at ICANN,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63567&EventID=185
0,"An increasing number of Western liberal democracies have experienced the rise of populist parties that propagate policies that threaten the fundamentals of democracy and the rule of law. One of the key questions there is how the bureaucracy reacts to political changes that bring populists to power through legitimate democratic elections. In established liberal democracies, bureaucrats have no ready-made scenarios to cope with illiberal politicians in such situations. In this paper, we empirically examine and theorize bureaucratic reactions to populist and authoritarian politicians in democracies that have experienced democratic backslides for longer periods. We expect to find that bureaucracies under populist and authoritarian regimes in weak democracies have developed coping strategies to deal with authoritarian incursions and expectations of regime change. To examine bureaucratic responses to democratic backsliding in the context of weak democracies, we focus on the case of Turkey. Turkey experienced a constitutional backsliding after the regime changed from a multi-party parliamentary systems into a ‘strong-man’ presidential system in 2018. The regime change came after a decades long buildup of increasingly authoritarian and illiberal policy measures under the ruling AKP government. As we are interested in this paper in the coping mechanisms of individual bureaucrats and bureaucratic agencies, we will empirically examine the cases of the State Planning Organization and the Social Benefits Agency. We will argue that professionalism and expertise can serve as important shields against authoritarian incursions into bureaucratic autonomy and backsliding in the context of illiberal democracies.",University College London,Kadir Has University,,,,,,,Kadir Has University,,Ozsel Beleli,Mehmet Kerem Coban,,,,,,,Mehmet Kerem Coban,,Democracy,Populism,Public Administration,,,,,,Institutionalized bureaucratic coping with democratic backsliding: Regime change and Bureaucratic responses in Turkey,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65101&EventID=185

However, they remain ad hoc, opening the door to arbitrary manoeuvre and triggering a debate on their institutionalization. What are the competing proposals aiming at institutionalizing DMPs within political systems? I suggest three ways for thinking about institutionalization: in terms of temporality, of legitimacy and support, and of power and role within a system. First, I analyze the dimension of time and how this affect DMP institutional designs. Second, I argue that because sortition produces ‘weak representatives’ with ‘humility-legitimacy’, mini-publics hardly ever make binding decisions and need to rely on external sources of legitimacies. Third, I identify four institutional models, relying on opposing views of legitimacy and politics: tamed consultation, radical democracy, representative klerocracy and hybrid polyarchy.

0,"When it comes to location – and almost by definition – most climate experiments and new low-carbon development practices have started in a local context. Local policy makers and governments, working closely with local citizen groups and private companies have helped to kick-start innovations. However, despite similar overall conditions, what started in one location did not start in others. Although support by higher levels of government may have been an important element, and occasionally decisive, the composition of local non-state actors and the capacities and capabilities of local governments would seem to be critical variables in this respect. These factors mattered whether and to what extent low-carbon innovations started at all, maintained their momentum over time, ensured inclusive and fair transitions, became a regular part of local practices and gradually became institutionalized. But what has been the role of a country’s political, administrative, and fiscal decentralization and related path dependencies, and how have multi-level governance arrangements shaped such innovations and influenced their sustainability? Based on an initial review of selected low-carbon initiatives in Brazil and South Africa, particularly in the renewable energy sector, this paper will address some of the conditions that have mattered crucially for institutionalizing low-carbon development practices.

0,"In the United States, the January 6, 2021 insurrection continues to be legitimized by significant sections of the Right Wing. In the first days of February 2022, as The New York Times, described: “Republicans were forced to either explain or denounce a party resolution characterizing the events of January 6th as legitimate forms of political discourse” (Epstein and Goldmacher 2022).  Epstein and Goldmacher observe that this may only be “preview of the battles ahead, with a series of upcoming primary contests pitting candidates loyal to Mr. Trump against those who, to varying degrees, resist his distortions about the election.”  
Democratic discourse relies on, if not a robust consensus in Habermas’ sense, at least common appreciation of “the rules of the game” and “discourse” (Ingraham 2019). This implies a recognition of the legitimacy of the process. But what if a significant number see that process as illegitimate: as “rigged,” or even the “mark of the Beast” (Revelation 13)?  This paper will explore some religious logics within QAnon, a driving force in the 2021 Insurrection.  It will consider QAnon’s persistence in the American religious landscape.  The potency of the religious discourse within QAnon legitimizes the “cause” of political insurrection and coup—and there is no “trumping” the Transcendent claims for authority that religion (or pseudo-religion) conjures up, especially with its authoritarian dimensions (Adorno 2000 [1975]).
In his “1937 article ‘Fascism, Son of Liberalism,’ Jacques Ellul described a shift taking place: from a society based on law to a society based on propaganda and what Ellul terms as ‘technique’” (Rollison 2017).   Ellul reflects on how both Leftist and Right-Wing discourse instrumentalize the “masses” via technical apparatuses and psychological mechanisms of polarization.  The paper will unpack the political consequences for the polarization of 21st century Christians in the political landscape, especially via the “Culture Wars” thesis from Hunter (1991). As Christians try to place themselves in the contemporary categories of Right/Left politics, the result is sometimes feelings of “political orphanhood.” This is precisely the foundation for a turn toward the anti-establishment (anti-)politics of the charismatic (Weber 1968), and nostalgic fascist tendencies (MAGA) combined with populism (Adorno 2000 [1975]).
This paper also suggests a call to action, channeling the voices of French theologian and sociologist, Jacques Ellul, and the 21st century Christian journalist, Chris Hedges.

We are well aware of the existence of numerous policies that are pertinent to the pursuit of integrity in public life, from anticorruption to judicial policy to policies pursued by various public sector watchdogs. Yet still, can integrity regulation be defined, and potentially distinguished, as a subfield within the wider area of regulatory governance? This paper argues that, in the scholarship on regulatory governance, integrity regulation has not yet consolidated as a “stand-alone” (sub)field, but that, given the realities and the increasing prominence of ethics in public life, it could be. The paper seeks to define integrity regulation positioning it within the context of several adjacent and overlapping areas of regulation and broader governance studies, including ‘regulation within government’, anticorruption, the traditional area of prosecution and justice policy, and several other emerging and sector-specific policies. The paper seeks to provide a theoretical case for consolidation and study of integrity governance, as a distinct regulation area, and position it conceptually vis-a-vis other areas of regulation and governance inquiry.

0,"A variety of inter- and intra-state violent conflicts around the globe creates an urgent impetus for early warning and response measures in the face of ever-changing threats. Often trans-national and internationalized nature of these conflict calls for the growing role of international inter- and non-governmental organizations. Considering the overlap in purposes and activities, as well as constant lack of resources, cooperation among international organizations of different ‘calibres’ seems like a plausible solution. 
The paper aims to explore whether and to what extent inter-organizational cooperation takes place in conflict early warning and response, such as preventive diplomacy and mediation. In particular, the focus is on the ‘heavyweights’ in the field, namely United Nations, European Union, regional organizations such as OSCE and African Union, as well as INGOs - the International Crisis Group and International Alert. The particular focus is on two Global South regions where groups of the above-mentioned organizations interact: Horn of Africa and Central Asia.

The extent to which interest groups are able to take up such responsibilities is likely to vary greatly among organizations, policy communities and countries. We depart from the idea that a vibrant interest group system relies on a combination of competition among groups as a means to offer choice to potential members and internal voice in decision-making as a means to secure independence from external (state) actors. The absence of external competition and internal voice make interest group systems vulnerable whereas the presence strengthens interest group elites to act responsibly and democratically. 

On the basis of CIG interest group survey data from a variety of European countries, we examine the differences in interest system vibrancy across countries, interest communities and individual interest groups. Our dependent variable, vibrancy, is understood as a combination of internal voice and external competitiveness. It is operationalised on the basis of survey-answers about membership-control over the organization (internal voice) and about the presence of like-organizations (competition).

0,"The literature on intergovernmental expert organizations (IPCC, IPBES, etc.) have shown that they often serve as sites of negotiations (Hughes and Vadrot (2019). There is now growing evidence that the most controversial objects in the IPCC approval process are those that relate to or have the potential to relate to negotiations within the UNFCCC, or that are simply (geo)politically ‘unacceptable’. As a result, tables, boxes and new scientific terms are often removed, made ambiguous or tightly defined in the text, which makes it increasingly difficult to introduce new scientific elements or challenge existing approaches that could contribute to the negotiations of climate change. Examples include emission reduction targets or budgets (Lahn and Sundqvist 2017; Lahn 2020), categorization of countries (Victor et al. 2014), ex post assessment of climate policies (Carraro et al. 2017) and legal terms bound to other international regimes (e.g. global commons). All of these triggered significant controversies in the IPCC, to the point of leading to self-censorship by authors in following assessment cycles. In this paper, we look at the social construction of controversial concepts, tables and boxes, at the (geo)political and legal interpretations that are derived from them, as well as at the governments/coalition of governments that condemn them to draw patterns of divisiveness.

Through their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and the process of pledge and review countries are to reduce emissions so that the goal of the Paris Agreement, global warming of no more than 1,5 C is reached. However, there is great variation among countries in how ambitious the NDCs are, and what domestic policies are put in place to achieve the national emission reduction targets. In this paper, we argue that one factor explaining these differences is the composition of the national climate policy networks and, in particular, the connectedness of those networks to international institutions. Political bargaining over how ambitious the NDCs should be and what policies should be put in place to achieve them, takes place between organizations within the national climate policy network, consisting of governmental, nongovernmental, business and scientific organizations. We analyze the composition of these networks using original survey data collected in 2021-22 in Sweden and Ireland. We focus, in particular, on the role of two level connectors, organizations that are involved in both the formulation of the international commitments (NDCs) and the national policies for achieving those commitments. Sweden has consistently been ranked as one of the most ambitious countries in climate change mitigation for years, while Ireland, with some fluctuation, tends to be ranked low. Our working hypothesis is that two level connectors occupy more central positions and wield more influence in the Swedish than in the Irish policy network, which contributes to the setting of more ambitious goals and stronger policies to achieve those goals.",University of Helsinki,University of Helsinki,Northumbria University,,,,,,University of Helsinki,,Tuomas Ylä-Anttila,Antti Gronow,Paul Wagner,,,,,,Tuomas Ylä-Anttila,,Coalition,Climate Change,Comparative Perspective,,,,,,"International commitments, national policies and climate change policy networks in Sweden and Ireland",https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65114&EventID=185
0,"Crimes against humanity is the most broadly applicable crime amongst the four international crimes codified in the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court. However, due to the strictures placed on the scope of crimes against humanity by its formal legal definition, the crime is unable to capture corporately wrought ecological damage. This is problematic given widely circulating claims that humanity is approaching the brink of ecological collapse. This essay appraises the innovative features of the recently published draft definition for ecocide as a novel international crime in order to mount a critique of the limited scope of crimes against humanity. It argues that the ecocide proposal can open up a window on the narrow range of perpetrators and types of violence that qualify as commissions of crimes against humanity. To demonstrate this point, the paper closely examines the crime’s context requirement and especially its policy element as both interact with the Rome Statute’s overall mens rea requirements. Taken together, these stipulations privilege states and state-like militant non-state actors who dispense policy-led violence with (in)direct intent. Ecocide, by contrast, is often committed by corporate actors with negligence or recklessness. Compared to crimes against humanity, the draft definition of ecocide significantly widens the ambit of international criminal responsibility by remaining silent on the kind of actor who can commit the crime and by articulating a comparatively lower mens rea standards of recklessness.

Nation branding practices have become ubiquitous in the contemporary global economic system as states compete to attract foreign investment, tourists, “high-skilled” migrants and germane to this study, international students. In their efforts to attract international students, governments around the world are relying on marketing techniques to cultivate and project positive images or brands, as worthy “host” countries. Commonly described as the “commodification” of national identity, nation branding offers a valuable lens to deepen our understanding of economic nationalism and its applicability in the contemporary moment. The literature on nation branding assumes a certain convergence between nationalist interests and economic motivations. Yet, an understanding of how notions of economic competitiveness and nationalism are articulated in the rationales behind these practices, and importantly how these articulations might vary according to context, is largely lacking. This paper seeks to remedy this gap by scrutinizing the meaning making behind international education branding initiatives, focusing on how notions of “economic competitiveness” and “nationalism” are articulated. Through a critical discourse analysis of international education policy documents and related political discussions in the UK and Scotland, the paper has two primary objectives: 1) to investigate how different forms of nationalism (namely the neonationalism behind Brexit, and minority nationalism in Scotland) influence nation branding rationales. 2) to problematize the orthodox views around economic nationalism and contribute to its renewed conceptualization. 
Alongside its contribution to the conceptualization of economic nationalism, the paper also seeks to shed light on the contradictions and complexities around the UK’s foreign policy role and ambitions. It will consider how the UK reconciles its protectionist Brexit rhetoric with the need to maintain a positive global image as a leader in international education, as well as elucidate how international education policy becomes entangled in the UK’s “competing” nationalisms.",Aarhus Universitet,,,,,,,,Aarhus Universitet,,Hannah Moscovitz,,,,,,,,Hannah Moscovitz,,Nationalism,Policy Analysis,Higher Education,Brexit,,,,,International Education as Nation Branding in the UK and Scotland: insights for economic nationalism,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64652&EventID=185
0,"The implementation of international law in federal states is an under-explored process. Subnational entities regularly enjoy a degree of sovereignty, which raises questions such as whether – and how – international law is effectively implemented at the subnational level. This paper aims to observe how such implementation takes place in practice in Switzerland with a focus on the roles of subnational political actors, such as members of cantonal governments and parliaments, subnational bureaucrats and civil society actors. We use two contrasted case studies: the cantonal implementation of the Council of Europe’s Istanbul Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence, and the obligation to make cantonal laws on data protection compliant with the European Union (EU) Directive 2016/680, in accordance with the Schengen Association Agreement (SAA). Based on an analysis of the official documentation and more than 50 semi-structured interviews with national and subnational actors (members of parliaments and governments, bureaucrats and civil society actors), we highlight the processes through which international obligations are implemented and translated into norms, policies and practices at the subnational level, and the complex roles played by subnational actors in this process. Furthermore, this paper offers a comparative analysis of the case studies, arguing against a monolithic conception of international law with regard to implementation. Indeed, while both treaties are legally binding in Switzerland, we observe different implementation processes and various actors’ attitudes towards their obligations. The paper ends with a discussion on the factors behind such differences (fields of international law, international consequences of non-implementation, organisations at the origin of the treaty, political balance of power at the subnational level) and their implications.",Université de Lausanne,,,,,,,,Université de Lausanne,,Matthieu Niederhauser,,,,,,,,Matthieu Niederhauser,,Executives,Federalism,Human Rights,Local Government,Parliaments,International,Domestic Politics,,International law at the subnational level: How political actors navigate between legalities,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64100&EventID=185
0,"Collective state recognition, usually expressed through international organisations, informs the way in which these bodies engage (or don’t) with those claiming statehood. These are, at a first glance, top-down processes, but are, in fact, also shaped by the statehood claimants who seek recognition. In this context and responding to calls for exploring the agency of those lacking in general recognition (e.g. Bryant and Hatay 2020, Visoka 2021), this paper explores the various ways in which these actors engage with different collective recognition processes. In specific, the paper answers: 1) how do statehood claimants embrace the collective recognition of their right to statehood towards strengthening a case for independence? This is done via the study of Timor-Leste before independence, adding to a literature that tends to concentrate on contemporary examples; 2) how do some statehood claimants use international statebuilding to argue that they have a functioning state and have ‘earned’ (Caspersen 2008) their sovereignty (example: Palestine); 3) in terms of those less recognised, the study of the TRNC allow us to reflect on how they manage to reframe non-recognition and circumvent its impact; 4) Lastly, the paper analyses efforts to come up with an alternative ‘international society’, as exemplified in the Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization. In this way, the paper responds to the workshop’s focus on the role of international organisations but adopts an approach that centers the agency of those seeking recognition rather than those granting it and, by doing so, offers alternative viewpoints of secession and state creation.",University of Birmingham,,,,,,,,University of Birmingham,,George Kyris,,,,,,,,George Kyris,,Conflict,Governance,International Relations,,,,,,"International Organisations, Collective Recognition and Sovereignty Agency in the Pursuit of Statehood",https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63562&EventID=185
0,"Contested states’ international engagement has generated hybrid diplomatic practices by capitalising on their “own political in-between-ness”, as  liminal actors of the international system (Bouris and Fernandez-Molina, 2018). This translates by a constant oscillation between reproductive and transformative ways of practising diplomacy, that is, on one hand the “mimicry” of state-led diplomacy  (McConnell, Moreau and Dittmer, 2012) and on the other, the “creative ambivalence” (McConnel, 2017, 149) contested states have to resort to in their external interactions. The present contribution focuses on this duality in contested states’ international engagement, by focusing on their networks of  representation abroad and their ambivalent relations to informal diplomacy. More particularly, how and why do representative offices maintain a balance between the symbolics and decorum of formal state-led diplomacy and an extensive use of practices characteristic of informal diplomacy? 

In order to do so, I will build up on the cases of Abkhazia, South-Ossetia, the Popular Republic of Donetsk and the Popular Republic of Luhansk. Firstly, these four contested states have constituted a well-endowed network of representative offices located in the EU- that is in states that did not grant them recognition. Additionally, they also have in common a similar geopolitical culture that shaped the choice of local partners to interact with. In a cross-case approach, I will rely on  semi-structured interviews with the heads of representative offices of South-Ossetia, Abkhazia and DPR and LPR  in France, Italy and Finland.

0,"The Common European Asylum System (CEAS) aims to harmonize European migration and asylum policies between the various nation-states (Craig & Zwaan, 2019). It is thus a major instrument of the ambiguous nexus that characterizes European asylum policies, between control and protection (Walter-Franke, 2018). Beside coercive regulations such as the “Dublin protocol”, the “Procedures” directive thus requires that all asylum seekers should have the right to an interpreter during institutional encounters, whether at first instance or before the appeal authority; namely, in France, OFPRA (Office Français de Protection des Réfugiés et Apatrides) and CNDA (Cour Nationale du Droit d’Asile). Despite their major financial, organizational and interactional consequences, interpreting issues in the French asylum procedure has been neglected, with only few exceptions (Pian, 2020). Yet, interpreting activity reveals a complex layout where national law is very vague, enabling OFPRA and CNDA to implement at an institutional level such crucial norms as those dealing with asylum seekers’ speech.
In line with the studies that analyze administrative agents’ discretionary power (Spire, 2008), the political implications of the neoliberal turn in the asylum administration (Akoka, 2020), and the ambiguous role of non-officials (D’Halluin-Mabillot, 2012), we will question how institutions shape the work of interpreters, and how the latter ambiguously contribute to implementing asylum interpreting policies.
A sociohistorical analysis of administrative archives highlights that both OFPRA and CNDA have developed specific interpreting standards. With both the traces of the negotiations of European directives, and those of their implementation through organizational schemes, they reveal how laws about interpreting become a political stake. In addition, ethnography puts into light the practices of the different actors and the agency of interpreters in putting laws into words.",Université Paris Cité,,,,,,,,Université Paris Cité,,Maxime Maréchal,,,,,,,,Maxime Maréchal,,Migration,Asylum,Policy Implementation,Refugee,,,,,Interpreting laws.

0,"On November, 25 2020 activists from the Italian feminist movement Non Una di Meno (NUDM) symbolically submitted receipts (printed on billboards) detailing the costs of the pandemic to the government. The care work performed freely or precariously by women and other essential workers during the first year of the crisis figured prominently among the expenditure items. The present paper explores this engagement with care and social reproduction and does so by grappling with a dilemma that has long haunted social movement studies, related to the relationship between structure and agency. Critical events – and thus, the present conjuncture – represent good empirical tests for any theory addressing this dilemma. Because critical events alone cannot univocally explain outcomes, much of the scholarly debate is focused on factors that mediate and explain movement agency. The role of movement opportunities, organization and grievances, are often explored in this sense. In contrast, this paper uses frame analysis to investigate pandemic discontinuities within the discourses and alliance practices of feminist contentious politics. 
By reflecting on 27 movements’ documents, 46 social media posts (posted between March, 2020 and December, 2020) and four in-depth interviews with movements’ activists, this work explores how the increased salience of care prompted the movement to expand its own frames in intersectional ways, making the struggles of ‘essential workers’ their own. On the one hand, the movement maintained its classic approach and denounced the exploitation of domestic-bound and feminized care work; on the other, it also began to question more radically the private/public boundary implied in this interpretation, showing how the work of social reproduction is performed by essential (and in most cases, underpaid, precarious and racialized) workers as well. These discursive innovations, prompted by the pandemic crisis, make NUDM’s diagnosis of an oppressive link between care and economic, patriarchal, capitalist violence all the more clear. Most importantly, however, this creative force shaped NUDM contentious politics and its alliances in the following two years. The movement’s ties with Yoox, GKN and multi-services sector workers as well as its participation to the central and eastern European collective E.A.S.T (Essential Autonomous Collective Struggles Transnational) all represent instances of intersectional, marginal feminist solidarity. NUDM alliance politics will be qualitatively assessed by retrieving movement documents and social media posts, as well as by analyzing transnational online movement assemblies as well. The expectation is to find a link between the aforementioned expanded movement frame and the direction of movement alliances. In unveiling the reciprocal influences of ideology and alliance practices in social movements and tracking how they have mediated the impact of the pandemic crisis, this paper tries to further complicate a picture which may otherwise appear too deterministic.",Scuola Normale Superiore,,,,,,,,Scuola Normale Superiore,,Greta Rossi,,,,,,,,Greta Rossi,,Contentious Politics,Social Movements,Feminism,Solidarity,,,,,Intersectional connections in an infected planet: bridging workers’ struggles and feminist contentious politics in pandemic Italy,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65879&EventID=185
0,"Building on my recently finished dissertation, where I develop an “intersectional time-theory of the state”, this paper tries to put a genealogical lens on correlative construction of temporality and stateness. Hereby I confront state- and timetheoretical assumptions coming from the mainstream of political science and historical sociology with approaches from critical race, postcolonial, gender and queer studies. Building on Foucault and anthropological studies of the state, this paper argues against seeing both the state and time as naturalized entities, which could be taken for granted, but rather focusses on the power- and knowledgebased constructions, which enable and link certain images, practices and institutions of stateness and time, while making others unthinkable. In this regard I see forms of “doing state” as intrinsically connected to ways of “doing time” and vice versa, involving temporal norms, structures, images, narratives and embodied forms of subjectivation, which structure the conduct of conduct, but are always highly contested, therefore giving expression to forms of social struggle. In opposition to apocalyptic descriptions of a current „withering away of the state” (Engels), what we are confronted with, so the argument of the paper goes, are examples of transformations of stateness that correspond to fundamental changes of social time norms, which both have important effects on processes of temporal subjectivation.",University of Vienna,,,,,,,,University of Vienna,,Jürgen Portschy,,,,,,,,Jürgen Portschy,,Conflict,Gender,Political Theory,Post-Structuralism,Race,State Power,LGBTQI,,Intersectional Temporalities of States in the Making: A Genealogical Approach.,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63226&EventID=185
0,"Intersectionality is a multifaceted field of inquiry stemming from Black feminist thought that calls out power structures and dynamics from which the interlinked climate, ecological, economic, and political crises stem. In this paper, I argue that intersectionality can inspire and strengthen the literature and efforts around radical socio-ecological transformations (SETs) towards just, care-full, anti-colonial, and degrowth futures. To do this, I explore the elements of the scholarship and praxis of two SET endeavors: the decolonization of the social imaginary and the construction of grassroots Green New Deals (GNDs). I investigate their concrete proposals for radical transformations towards the desired futures and suggest the ways in which intersectionality - as a critical social theory, an analytical approach, or an organizing strategy - strengthens and advances the efforts around decolonizing the social and cultural imaginary and around building and implementing bottom-up visions for GNDs. The benefits of this interface present how intersectionality enhances these SET endeavors by centering justice, solidarity, care, and coalition and alliance building, by capturing the plurality in praxis and visions toward transformation, by embracing complexity in understanding differentiated impacts and in building desired futures, and by studying the experiences of transformations of diverse groups of people.",Universitat Pompeu Fabra,,,,,,,,Universitat Pompeu Fabra,,Simona Getova,,,,,,,,Simona Getova,,Social Justice,Critical Theory,Feminism,Climate Change,Theoretical,,,,Intersectionality’s contribution to decolonization of the social imaginary and to the construction of grassroots Green New Deals as collective projects for socio-ecological transformation,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65414&EventID=185
0,"Non-mainstream parties are often portrayed in the literature as loosely organised and ideologically extreme. Among them, populist parties in particular are expected to emphasise the role of the leader, either by weakening intermediate party structures and centralising the powers of the secretary or by relying on (quasi-)plebiscitary decision-making. However, such organisational features (or the lack thereof) are often assumed, rather than measured directly. Indeed, the existing evidence on the internal structures of non-mainstream and populist parties is contradictory. Moreover, populist parties’ organisational change over time is hardly ever addressed by the literature, particularly in a comparative and cross-national perspective. 
Party organisation is relevant also because it has implications for the ideological evolution of non-mainstream actors. In general, previous contributions have hypothesised that those parties are less likely to shift position following the preferences of the median voter compared to mainstream actors, which enjoy more resources for campaigns and fear less potential vote losses. However, non-mainstream parties might also face incentives towards ideological moderation – for instance, to present themselves as viable partners for a coalition government. 
In the proposed paper, I jointly examine ideological and organisational change among non-mainstream and in particular populist parties, arguing that these actors might indeed shift their ideological position over time, and that the extent that they do so depends on their internal structure. 

My analysis will estimate the effect of intra-party democracy on party ideological change using multi-level regression models applied to 10 European countries. I will use alternative measures of the relevant variables, to assess the consistency of measurements based on official party documents and on expert surveys. Accordingly, I will rely on the PPDB and DALP datasets to measure the independent variable (intra-party democracy) and on CMP/MARPOR and CHES for the dependent variables (issue position and issue salience).
This allows me to study the effect of more inclusive and democratic decision-making procedures on parties’ ideological flexibility, showing that populist parties could indeed follow different patterns of ideological change, depending on their internal organisation. By doing so, consequently, this paper also aims to show: (i) whether populist parties take up some features of mainstream parties (either in terms of organisation or ideology) over time and (ii) whether these changes are encouraged by external (e.g. government participation or vote loss) and/or internal factors (intra-party democracy).

Overall, this research sheds light on party organisation as a pivotal, although often neglected, driver of ideological change. This is particularly crucial to study for populist parties, which are deemed to be new and still unstructured components of the party system, yet are increasingly recognized as powerful determinants of its characteristics. Moreover, the extent to which parties can shift position has additional implications for the responsiveness and representativeness of the whole party system. In fact, by taking up issues that were previously not salient or accommodating the prevalent position of public opinion, parties might increase their responsiveness to citizens’ priorities and improve the overall representation of voters’ preferences.",University of Vienna,,,,,,,,University of Vienna,,Sofia Marini,,,,,,,,Sofia Marini,,Comparative Politics,Democracy,Extremism,Political Parties,Populism,Party Members,Party Systems,,Intra-party democracy and ideological change of populist parties,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64190&EventID=185
0,"Policy-making is a complex business. While we do have a solid understanding of the role of parties, interest groups, and other political actors, we know surprisingly little about the role of individual ministries in the policy process. Yet, ‘Inter-Ministry Politics’ matter because the involvement of different ministries has different (re)distributive consequences and implications for representation and responsiveness. For example, we expect that climate, social, or immigration policies take different forms depending on whether the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, or the Ministry of Social Affairs are involved. But we lack systematic analysis of this important topic. 
Our ambition is to systematically gather and extend existing arguments and findings into a coherent perspective on the role of individual ministries for policy-making and to propose ‘Inter-Ministry Politics’ as a fruitful research agenda. In order to do so, we first systematically review existing public policy and public administration literature on the factors that influence the preferences of ministries as well as on their power to translate these preferences into policy output. 
Second, we illustrate the usefulness and importance of our ‘Inter-Ministry Politics’ approach by studying policy-making in Germany – a least likely case, due to its high number of veto points, its interwoven multilevel governance structure, and the ministerial bureaucracies’ rather low agenda-setting powers (Schnapp 2004). We coded the distributive profiles and responsible ministries for all adopted (social) policy proposals in the German Bundestag between 1949 and 2020. The analysis shows that different ministries indeed do result in different distributive profiles – even when holding the partisan composition of government and the policy field constant. 
Third, we conclude by developing a research agenda with at least three avenues: we need a more systematic understanding of 1) the role of individual ministries in the policy process, 2) substantial preferences of different ministries, and 3) the conditions under which ministries can ‘win’ the inter-ministerial political game and influence policy output.",Johann Wolfgang Goethe-Universität Frankfurt,Johann Wolfgang Goethe-Universität Frankfurt,,,,,,,Johann Wolfgang Goethe-Universität Frankfurt,,Julian Garritzmann,Katrijn Siderius,,,,,,,Julian Garritzmann,,Government,Public Administration,Policy-Making,,,,,,Introducing ‘Inter-Ministry Politics’: Analyzing the Role and Crucial Redistributive Impact of Individual Ministries in Policy-Making,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64776&EventID=185
0,"We live in challenging times. New, post-materialistic values emerge in our societies that often are at odds with policies and institutions in place. New groups and initiatives represent those values, challenging the status quo and the actors maintaining it. Are such struggles reflected in narratives occurring in political debates? If so, how do they manifest? We investigate these questions by examining the case of animal welfare policies in the European Parliament.
The agricultural system is in the midst of far-reaching transformation processes, as agricultural activities are a major contributor to climate change and environmental degradation. Changing public demands and consumption patterns further contribute to the pressure on food production systems to become more sustainable. In particular, current practices in intensive livestock farming are subject to increasing criticism. The reasons are manifold. In addition to the exploitation and pollution of land and water resources, the welfare of farmed animals is a major challenge that is receiving increasing attention in many countries. Policymakers at the national and at the EU level are currently struggling to find ways to make agriculture more animal-friendly. Recently, farm animal welfare has also been on the agenda of the European Parliament, partly as a reaction to the successful EU citizen initiative “End the Cage Age”. Whereas historically the EU by means of the Common Agricultural Policy has promoted a productivity and income-oriented policy approach, sustainability and animal welfare issues are now gaining importance. In particular, the increasing share of green parties in the current European Parliament (EP) is likely to contribute to the strengthening of animal-welfare goals within agricultural policymaking. 
What role does animal welfare play within the realignment of EU agricultural policymaking? Which policy preferences do different political groups within the EP have towards the issue of animal welfare? As to what degree do policy positions and preferences change from the 8th to the 9th EP election period? In order to explore these research questions, we apply the Narrative Policy Framework to plenary discourses in the 8th and 9th European Parliament. This allows us to identify discourse patterns and discourse coalitions as well as changes in narrative structure over time. In view of the sketched challenges and pressures facing the agricultural policy subsystem coupled with the strengthening of the Greens within the EP, we expect major changes in the discourse and the realignment of coalitions. More precisely, we expect farm animals and consumers more often to be portrayed as victims, environmental activists as heroes and large-scale farmers as villains.",Deutsche Hochschule für Verwaltungswissenschaften Speyer – DHV,Ruprecht-Karls-Universität Heidelberg,"University of Speyer, Germany",,,,,,Deutsche Hochschule für Verwaltungswissenschaften Speyer – DHV,,Johanna Kuenzler,Anne-Marie Parth,Colette S.

Which policy outputs exist in which countries? Are there factors which can predict similar policy outputs between countries?  In this paper, we shed light on the global development of organic policies over time and investigate how countries support upscaling of the organic sector. Further, we identify country characteristics to explain differences in countries’ policy efforts to support organic agriculture. Using FiBL & IFOAM – Organics International annual reports ‘The World of Organic Agriculture: Statistics & Emerging Trends’, this research outlines the current status of organic agriculture policy globally. Policy outputs are categorized following Schneider & Ingram (1990)’s behavioural assumptions of policy tools to understand how countries support their respective organic sectors, and thus perceive the challenge of upscaling organic agriculture. We then compare countries’ policy outputs against traditional development indicators for economic wellbeing (GDP, HDI), as well as national organic production area, market share, export share, and green party representation in national governing bodies to explain policy variations between countries, and identify potential driving factors of policy development for organic agriculture. We expect to see a correlation between higher economic wellbeing, national organic production area, market share, export share, and green party representation, and a higher frequency of policy outputs for organic agriculture. By identifying the driving factors behind policy development for organic agriculture, this research seeks to demonstrate how the (niche) organic market can be further up-scaled for broader socio-ecological transformation of the global farming sector.",Ruprecht-Karls-Universität Heidelberg,Ruprecht-Karls-Universität Heidelberg,,,,,,,Ruprecht-Karls-Universität Heidelberg,,Charlene Marek,Simon Schaub,,,,,,,Charlene Marek,,Environmental Policy,Governance,Policy Analysis,Global,,,,,Investigating Socio-Ecological Transformation of the Farming Sector:  What Drives Policy Development for Organic Agriculture?,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=62284&EventID=185
0,"Political campaigns are increasingly resorting to targeted advertising on social media platforms to reach potential voters. Social media companies like Meta provide advertisers with a wide variety of targeting criteria based on user demographics, behaviors, and inferred interests. However, there is a different entity ultimately responsible for deciding who is delivered which ad: the ad delivery algorithm. The algorithm is set up to learn which ads are more “relevant” for which audience and may deliver ads to certain audiences without the explicit intention or knowledge of the advertiser themselves (Ali et al. 2019, 2021). 

Recent research finds that the delivery of ads that run at the same time, with the same target audience, and the same budget can be heavily skewed along gendered and racial stereotypes (Ali et al. 2019). In the realm of political advertising, researchers have demonstrated that ads are more likely to be delivered to ideologically similar audiences, and presenting a liberal ad to liberal users costs almost half as much as showing the same ad to a conservative audience (Ali et al., 2021). 

Studies on the role of ad algorithms in political advertising have focused on the United States, and to the best of our knowledge, no similar effort has been made to discover how ad algorithms influence political ad delivery in an European multi-party context. To fill this gap in the literature, we collaborated with three Dutch political parties to place 135 identical ads on Facebook and Instagram targeting 9 different audiences in the run-up to the country's municipal elections on March 16th, 2022. To make sure any difference in pricing and delivery occurs only due to the party placing the ad and the target audience, the ads run with the exact same settings, at the same time, using the same daily budgets, texts, and images. 

We hypothesize that audiences who are more aligned with the party platform and the ad content are cheaper in cost and delivered to more people. We find clear differences in pricing and delivery between parties and audiences, however not always in line with our pre-registered expectations. We find evidence that certain parties are charged more than other parties, with one party, in particular, paying 7.5 to 10% less on average to reach 1000 users, despite using the exact same settings. We also consistently find that it is harder for political parties to reach certain audiences, for example, lower-educated citizens.

Our findings have several implications for political parties and democracy. First, unbeknownst to them, certain parties spend more money to woo prospective voters, resulting in an unequal playing field. Furthermore, some groups of people are systematically less likely to receive political advertisements and more expensive to reach, potentially isolating these groups from receiving election-related information. Finally, our findings imply that banning or severely limiting advertiser targeting capabilities, as some legislators are proposing, may be counterproductive since it will only give more power to the black box of the ad delivery algorithm to target specific groups without oversight or transparency.",University of Amsterdam,,,,,,,,University of Amsterdam,,Fabio Votta,,,,,,,,Fabio Votta,,Political Parties,Advertising,Campaign,Social Media,Field Experiments,,,,Investigating the Meta ad delivery algorithm with Dutch political parties,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65306&EventID=185
0,"Over the past 30 years, treaty-based Investor-State Dispute Settlement (ISDS) has become one of the main ways to settle disputes between investors and host states. Although scholars have tried to empirically measure the expected effects of a ‘Future without (Treaty-Based) ISDS,’ history can also shed light on this question. It is well known that in the past, several legal and political tools were available to deal with investor-state disputes, such as recourse to lump-sum agreements, diplomatic protection, etc. One question has not yet been answered: how are investor-state disputes mediated when a bilateral investment treaty (BIT) exists between two states, but without an ISDS clause? Although it has been convincingly shown how and why several capital-exporting states included ISDS clauses in their BITs during the 1960s and 1970s, outliers exist. (West-)Germany and Switzerland were, besides for the first countries to start negotiating BITs, also among the last capital-exporting states to include ISDS clauses in their Model BITs, doing so respectively in the early and late 1980s. As a result, both countries have concluded dozens of BITs that only include state-state dispute settlement clauses. In this paper, I describe how investor conflicts based on these ‘non-ISDS BITs’ were dealt with by the Swiss and German government during the period 1959-1989, using archival records of the ministries involved in the negotiation of BITs in Germany and Switzerland. These records, which refer to investor conflicts in countries such as Iran or Ecuador, not only reveal how such conflicts were mediated, but also show how a future without treaty-based ISDS could look like.",Ghent University,,,,,,,,Ghent University,,Filip Batselé,,,,,,,,Filip Batselé,,International Relations,Courts,Investment,,,,,,Investor-state conflicts before ISDS: Evidence from the Swiss & German archives (1959-1989),https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63862&EventID=185
0,"While emigrants are credited with an active role in efforts toward their right to vote, the role of immigrants is regularly ignored or dismissed. I argue that this dismissal of immigrant activism in much of the enfranchisement literature is frequently a result of methodological choices on the part of researchers. Due to institutional barriers as well as strategic choices by campaigners, the visibility of immigrant involvement in efforts toward the right to vote can be reduced. This low visibility presents a methodological challenge for scholars studying enfranchisement because the administrative paper trail can be insufficient to unearth immigrant activism. I revisit Switzerland as one of the most widely studied cases of immigrant enfranchisement with the help of two subnational case studies—the cantons Geneva and Zurich. Not only were immigrants involved in various ways, but at certain points along the process their engagement could even prove critical. By comparing parliamentary debates with interview as well as archival evidence, I demonstrate that only the latter two provide a glimpse into the contributions of immigrants to their enfranchisement.",University of Oxford,,,,,,,,University of Oxford,,Klaudia Wegschaider,,,,,,,,Klaudia Wegschaider,,Representation,Immigration,Activism,,,,,,Invisible Activism: Immigrants and their Efforts toward their own Enfranchisement,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63936&EventID=185

Relying on emotions, creationism, religious beliefs, and common sense over expertise purposefully creates a counter-knowledge referred to as pseudo-science (Dawes 2018), troll-science (Eslen-Ziya 2020), or fake science (Edis 2020).  It is projected politically and ideologically charged alternative knowledge and has changed the way science and experts used it to inform political decision-making. As the worth of scientific expertise is devalued, the counter-scientific discourses supported through right-wing political rhetoric help produce a culture of resistance to science. This paper will analyze the tweets shared to invite people to protest COVID-19 vaccination and COVID-19 imposed restrictions in three big cities of Turkey (Istanbul, Ankara, and Izmir). I will also study the co-occurrent hashtags to explore how the development of counter knowledge serves as a catalyser of producing and disseminating public sentiments on populist discourses for bringing people together and creating a common identity.",University of Stavanger,University of Stavanger,,,,,,,University of Stavanger,,Hande Eslen-Ziya,Ezgi Kadayifci,,,,,,,Hande Eslen-Ziya,,Democracy,Populism,Knowledge,Social Media,,,,,"Irrationality, conspiracy theories and anti-science movements – Anti-vaccine mobilisation during COVID-19 pandemic in Turkey",https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64369&EventID=185
0,"The rise of populist radical right (PRR) ideas stresses the importance of understanding how individuals are exposed to and engage with PRR content in high-choice information environments. However, this task is complicated by the multitude of channels via which such exposure can take place. This prompts the need for developing automated approaches for identifying PRR content. In this paper, we share insights from our experience of developing automated classifiers for differentiating between PRR and non-PRR textual content in the German language. By training and comparing 66 dictionary-, supervised machine learning-, deep learning-, and transformer-based classification models, we offer a systematic comparison of their performance on three validation sets of PRR textual items and examine the impact of different pre-processing steps (e.g., stemming and lemmatization) on models’ performance. We also discuss the use of synthetic models (i.e., combining individual classification models in the ensemble form) for PRR classification based on a comparison of 396 model combinations. Our findings demonstrate that transformer- and supervised machine learning-based models show the best performance on average among the individual models and it can further be improved using synthetic models which combine supervised machine learning- and dictionary-based approaches.",Universität Bern,Universität Koblenz-Landau,Universität Bern,Koblenz-Landau Universität,Universität Koblenz-Landau,Universität Bern,Universität Bern,Universität Bern,Universität Bern,,Silke Adam,Clara Christner,Ernesto de León,Teresa Gil Lopez,Michaela Maier,Mykola Makhortykh,Maryna Sydorova,Aleksandra Urman,Mykola Makhortykh,,Populism,Methods,Quantitative,,,,,,Is a single model enough?

0,"In parliamentary systems, executives play a major legislative role: they draft and propose legislation, and build the necessary coalition to ensure that a given bill will become law. Other parliamentary groups are often seen as residual, having very little influence on the policy making process. However, some parliamentary groups might be more effective than others at inserting their policy proposals into enacted legislation. Due to data and methodological limitations, large-N and systematic studies of the conditions under which parliamentary groups are successful at influencing legislation are extremely rare, leaving crucial questions about who and why has power at influencing legislation unanswered. To what extent do parliaments reverse executive proposals? What parliamentary groups are more efficient in performing this task? In order to answer these questions, first, we compare executive bills proposals as they enter the legislative process with the final text of laws using text reuse methods. Next, we identify the parliamentary group responsible for the different amendments and calculate the amendments’ efficiency rate for each group. The theoretical framework explores causality considering variations in the type of government, ideological distance among parties, political polarization and issue jurisdiction. The analysis relies on a database containing all the executive bills introduced into the Spanish Parliament from 1996 to present.",Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam,Universitat de Barcelona,Universitat de Barcelona,,,,,,Universitat de Barcelona,,Andreu Casas,Anna Palau,Andreu Rodilla Lázaro,,,,,,Andreu Rodilla Lázaro,,Parliaments,Quantitative,Policy-Making,,,,,,Is Amending Activity Effective?

0,"Business firms are increasingly expected to take forceful stands against injustice and demonstrate the positive social impact of their activities. However, the justification for this public expectation remains contested. Many appeal to stakeholder theory to support the position that firms should conduct themselves as good corporate citizens. According to stakeholder theory, firms are accountable to all individuals who are affected by the firm’s activities. Since a firm’s activities can affect virtually everybody, stakeholder theory supports wide duties of corporate beneficence. Stakeholder theory is supposed to offer a superior replacement for shareholder primacy theory, which holds that firms’ sole duties are to maximize profits for their shareholders. While we agree with critics of shareholder primacy that it offers an implausibly narrow understanding of firms’ social obligations, we hold that democratic worries about corporate power impose important limitations on corporate duties of beneficence. We contend that stakeholder theory, as currently understood, unwittingly grants to firms a degree of political power that is incompatible with democratic legitimacy. Ultimately, we argue for an alternative approach to CSR that better incorporates the distinctive demands that democracy makes on corporate actors.",University of Oxford,Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München – LMU,,,,,,,University of Oxford,,Theodore Lechterman,Benjamin Lange,,,,,,,Theodore Lechterman,,Citizenship,Democracy,Political Economy,Political Theory,Business,Ethics,Normative Theory,Capitalism,Is Corporate Social Responsibility Democratically Irresponsible?,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65880&EventID=185
0,"Covid-19 has triggered an unprecedented global health crisis in 2020, compared in magnitude only to the Spanish flu a century earlier. While the pandemic is still ongoing, from its very beginning public discourses in various global locations have reiterated that there is no return to what was known as “normal,” that the “new normal” is abnormality and that the world will evolve as a completely different place after COVID-19. Such discourses allude to what historical institutionalists have long considered a “critical juncture,” a crucial period of time of extreme uncertainty that profoundly changes political, social and economic structures and sets political relationships on paths they have not been before (Collier and Collier 1991, Pierson 2004, Capoccia and Kelemen 2007). 
This paper explores whether COVID-19 is indeed such a critical juncture in the international governance of migration, refugees and diasporas. Migration has been seriously affected by the swift retraction of sovereign power of states and drastic imposition of mobility restrictions. Yet, how profound have been such changes in discourses and practices regarding migration governance? And how profound have they been in different parts of the world? Drawing empirical evidence from Bulgaria, Mexico and Lebanon prior to and after the pandemic onset in March 2020, we examine in cross-comparative perspective political discourses and practices of securitization of migration through threat and risk, considered expected responses during uncertain periods, as well as additional policy responses made during the pandemic. We argue that while COVID-19 has indeed contributed to securitizing migration responses, such a ‘critical juncture’ as a “rupture in time and place” needs to be contextualized within longer-term temporalities and continuities of securitization.",Universidad de las Américas Puebla,University of Warwick,Aalborg Universitet,,,,,,Aalborg Universitet,,Marianne Marchand,Maria Koinova,Tamirace Fakhoury,,,,,,Tamirace Fakhoury,,Europe (Central and Eastern),Governance,Latin America,Migration,Policy Change,,,,Is COVID-19 a Critical Juncture in International Migration Governance?,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64921&EventID=185
0,"Our article offers empirical insight into the discussion on how mediation contributes to policy learning, and the role of social contagion in this process. Collective policy-making processes in complex modern democracies often involve a variety of organizations embedded complex communication structures: groups of organizations and organizational representatives draft and redraft and discuss and send information in bilateral exchanges, smaller groups and plenaries. Whether policy learning can result from such a process depends on, among other things, the structure of the emerging communication network, and specifically the role of mediating organizations making sure information is passed on where it needs to be, conflicts are dealt with and different knowledge bases translated.

We analyse an example of such a process with network and qualitative methods. Our material is based on Estonia, a forest rich country in Europe, characterized by wide social conflict over forest governance in recent years. In order to address these conflicts, Estonian Ministry of Environment made an unprecedented effort in organizing a cross-sectoral collaborative platform for the creation of the Forestry Policy Development Plan for the next decade. Although the platform bought together 42 organizations in intense information exchange and negotiations aimed at achieving agreement over forest policy, the platform was disbanded after two years without achieving its aims. 

We measured information exchange, trust and beliefs among the members of the policy network before and after the intervention, and conducted extensive interviews during and after the process. Based on the data, we conclude that one of the main deficits in the collaboration process was of mediation. Qualitative data indicates that ministry in charge of collaboration took a passive role and expected administrative rules and procedures to result in consensual agreement. Survey data indicates that clusters of information exchange and reciprocal trust among the policy network largely coincides. 

We hypothesize that while collaboration process itself contributes to increasing both information exchange and reciprocal trust between actors of the network, a prerequisite for learning, mediation of this dispersed information is required for collective-level policy learning. We further analyse the role of social contagion in the change in reciprocal trust in received information before and after the intervention and hypothesize that network structure influences on who information is exchanged with and to what extent this information is trustworthy. The second hypothesis would reinforce our suggestion that in the absence of formal mediation effort, informal social contagion influences whose information is trusted and who’s not.",University of Helsinki,University of Helsinki,,,,,,,University of Helsinki,,Arho Toikka,Peeter Vihma,,,,,,,Peeter Vihma,,Conflict,Environmental Policy,Governance,Knowledge,Mixed Methods,Policy-Making,,,Is creating an opportunity to learn enough?

However, scientific debates about the new form of political system in some countries highlighted again the politicisation tendencies in this region. 
Based on previous research findings the top level of civil servant system in Hungary was and is highly politicized. It is also true even though laws declare the separation politicians and bureaucracy leaders in cabinets. However, having any special policy expertise also can be important to fill civil servant positions in the cabinets. 
Regarding to the post-2010 Hungarian governments connections between politics, expertise and expected neutrality of bureaucrats need new explanations. The fact is, that more and more outsiders were appointed in state secretary positions after 2010 in the Hungarian ministries.

0,"The last decade was the “decade of populism,” with the late breakthrough of right-wing populism in Germany and Spain and populists coming to power in Hungary, Poland, and Italy. Scholars stress that the role of the media and a changing media landscape are crucial factors for the increasing success of populist parties, with many linking it explicitly to the growing importance of political social media communication. Social media seems well suited for a populist communication style, characterized by emotionalization, negative affects, taboo-breaking, and simplification, which are well-suited for the emerging social media logic. Facebook, in particular, has been speculated to facilitate the spread of populism, as the platform is accused of being too careless when it comes to regulating its content. However, although much research has been conducted in the area of single-country studies, which have analyzed to what extent populism has played a role in various social media campaigns, comparative studies are scarce. One problem is, especially when it comes to Facebook data, the increasingly limited data access, although analyzing Facebook is highly relevant, given that the platform is among the most used social media platforms across the globe. A first glance at the most liked Facebook fanpages of political parties in Europe shows that eight out of ten belong to populist parties. Is this just the tip of the iceberg, or are those eight parties just suggesting a correlation that does not hold up against further scrutiny? 
The article investigates the social media performance of populist compared to non-populist parties in Europe. While the Facebook API only allows access to incomplete and biased samples, the comparatively novel initiative Crowdtangle makes (unbiased) full samples available for researchers. The obtained party-level Facebook data can then be linked to party-level datasets such as CHES and specific party-level populism datasets such as the PopuList and POPPA. Fine-grained measures of populism and its subdimensions allow identifying the driving factors behind Facebook performance, including attached ideologies and other related aspects.
The research will be guided by two main research questions: 1) Is the political discourse on Facebook dominated by populist parties? 2) Does content by populist parties generate more and different user attention? The analysis will cover aggregated page-level activities for 2020, including post frequency, page likes, shares, reactions, and comments. Post-level data will be used to analyze to what extent populists receive more (in terms of frequency) and different (in terms of reactions) attention.",Westfälische Wilhelms-Universität Münster,,,,,,,,Westfälische Wilhelms-Universität Münster,,Jan Philipp Thomeczek,,,,,,,,Jan Philipp Thomeczek,,Political Parties,Populism,Quantitative,Social Media,,,,,Is Political Discourse on Facebook dominated by Populist Parties?

However, the implications of politics as a stress factor for mental health and wellbeing still require scientific inquiry. We start addressing this issue by focusing on affective polarisation as a political stressor. Research on affective polarisation has primarily focused on discovering the causes of the phenomenon while its consequences remain by and large unknown. In this paper, we ask whether affective polarisation has a negative impact on people’s mental health and wellbeing. We answer this question by analysing data from four different panel studies from the Netherlands, Switzerland, the United States and Britain which include alternative measures of mental distress and wellbeing.

0,"This paper examines the translation of UN women’s economic empowerment norms at the domestic level through international organizations (IOs) in post-war states, taking the international system in Kosovo as the primary case study. Through a comparative analysis of different IOs in Kosovo, the paper assesses the extent to which international actors are delivering on international commitments to women’s economic empowerment at the local level, and the mechanisms through which this process operates. Drawing on semi-structured interviews and documentary analysis, it analyses how various IOs have engaged with UN norms relating to women’s economic empowerment on the ground, such as the SDGs and the Women, Peace and Security Agenda. The paper concentrates on the decision-making and design phases of country-level office programming, in order to analyse international agencies’ contributions to the implementation of women’s empowerment norms and the variations between IOs in this regard. Second, it examines the interplay between different international entities in this particular issue area, shedding light on how the presence of overlapping international actors affects norm implementation at the domestic level. By focusing specifically on the country-office level of international organizations, this paper makes a significant theoretical contribution by reflecting on how IOs exercise agency beyond the HQ level at the global-local nexus. This study argues that it is essential to better understand the contributions of the country-level offices of global governance organizations to enable more effective policy engagement.

0,"Recently, we have seen a dramatic increase of support for climate assemblies, especially in Europe. Choosing the remit for a climate assembly is one of the most important design factors conveners must decide on. So far, conveners seem to have followed examples of preceding climate assemblies. This has led to a prevailing model of climate assemblies assigned with remits of a broad scope, even though many in the network have expressed their concerns. Some argue, participants do not have enough time to understand and discuss the problems, the proposed measures, and their implications; or that a long list of recommendations increases the likelihood of cherry-picking. Citizens’ assemblies frequently hailed as success stories, such as the Irish assemblies on same sex marriage and abortion have had much more confined scopes. Alternative models of assemblies focussing on more specific issues of sustainability may be an alternative. The question then is: What characterises suitable remits for citizens’ assemblies on sustainability issues that aim for transformative policy and societal impact? We conducted expert surveys followed by moderated group discussions to develop a set of criteria for conveners to consider when choosing the remit for their assembly. Subsequently, we applied the criteria in Germany.

Given the dramatic decline in religion - especially among young people- has there been a corresponding decline in democratic engagement? Using survey data from the Comparative Study of Electoral Systems (CSES) collected in 35 advanced democracies, this paper investigates the impact of religious affiliation on two measures of youth engagement: turnout and party identification. The findings show that religious affiliation has an independent positive effect on democratic engagement. That is, religion facilitates engagement among the old and the young alike. However, the religious context of the country in question moderates this relationship: the positive effect only applies in secular environments where being religiously affiliated is more distinctive. These results are in line with the social network theory, suggesting that religious social networks in advanced societies can facilitate youth engagement with democracy.",Australian National University,,,,,,,,Australian National University,,Intifar Chowdhury,,,,,,,,Intifar Chowdhury,,Comparative Politics,Democracy,Political Participation,Religion,Quantitative,Survey Research,Voting Behaviour,Youth,Is the Decline in Religion Contributing to Youth Disengagement in Advanced Democracies?,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=62814&EventID=185

We bridge this gap and broaden the scope to other mental health conditions, in addition to depression. We use two sets of panel data to track how changes in individual’s mental health status is related changes in their voting behaviour: the Dutch LISS survey and the British 1970 Cohort Study. Both of these data sets have indicators of multiple mental health distortions or symptoms, such as depression, anxiety, hostility, obsession-compulsion and psychoticism.

0,"This research note explores the link between the advocacy activity of organized interests and political distrust among citizens. It sets out an argument for why such a link could exist and why it is worth exploring empirically. In addition, it sets out a preliminary future research agenda on how this link can best be empirically assessed. The role of interest groups within contemporary democracies is often seen as one that functions as a so called ‘transmission belt’ between citizens and politics (Albareda, 2018; Albareda & Braun, 2019) giving the former group a voice and therewith making them more eager to participate in and trust politics (Dahl, 1961; Putnam, 1993). Unfortunately, this ideal type of idea does not always work well in practice (Binderkrantz, 2009; Gilens & Page, 2014; Halpin, 2006) as interest representation often reproduces societal inequalities regarding agenda setting, policy representation and access (Albareda, 2021; Strolovitch, 2005; Aizenberg & Hanegraaff, 2020; Schlozman, 1984; Salisbury, 1984). What is more, the activity of interest groups can be linked to behavior that is characterized by a lack of transparency as well as regulation and leads to the occasional lobbying scandal widely covered in the news media. We know from the literature that political scandals, negative news and a lack of transparency can all, under certain circumstances and to some extent, lead to feelings of political distrust among citizens (Bowler & Karp, 2004; Grimmelikhuijsen, et al., 2014; Kleinnijenhuis, 2006), yet we do not know whether and to what extent these dynamics are assigned by citizens to the activity of lobbying and whether they are related to feelings of political distrust among them. This paper taps into these questions by building on these literatures and presenting an argument on why there is a plausible link between lobbying activity by organized interests and perceptions of political distrust among citizens.

This is the case even though data now occupies a central position in economies everywhere and is widely considered the “new oil” of the digital age. What has emerged instead is a collection of fragmented and sometimes conflicting data governance regimes and regulations at national and regional levels. Disparate perspectives on data protection, which are based on differing conceptualisations of data (see Obendiek 2021), account for the lack of a universal approach. This article traces the development of three distinct varieties of macro-level big data governance, which have emerged in the EU (citizen-centred), US (corporation-centred), and China (state-centred), and that appear to be representative of the current range of data governance regimes that states can pursue. It then assesses the pitfalls of a fragmented and incoherent data governance regime at the global level, and in doing so, addresses the question, ‘is there a need for global data governance?’ Specific areas of data governance that may benefit from global agreement and universal application will be explored.",University of Helsinki,,,,,,,,University of Helsinki,,Monique Taylor,,,,,,,,Monique Taylor,,Cyber Politics,Governance,Policy Analysis,Political Economy,Global,Comparative Perspective,Big Data,,Is There a Need for Global Data Governance?,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63348&EventID=185
0,"This paper explores whether the concept of instrument constituencies can provide a sufficient explanation for the sustained popularity of entrepreneurship promotion policies. The concept of instrument constituencies is a recent theoretical innovation, and there were only few empirical demonstrations so far. Their presence has not been studied for the policy measures in question. This paper can contribute to a better understanding of the trajectory of this policy instrument and can also help the advancement of theory.

In recent years, policy measures aimed at increasing the number of entrepreneurs have been widely popular and have been promoted across different jurisdictions and issue areas. These policies try to motivate more people to become entrepreneurs, and they include a combination of promotion activities, provision of free or subsidised services (like mentoring), and financial support. Despite their popularity, their effectiveness was repeatedly questioned by scholars (see for example Acs et al., 2016).  Regardless of concerns, the instrument remains actively promoted both by local experts and by international organisations. It is “prescribed” to alleviate various problems like unemployment, slow economic growth, inclusion of marginalised groups, etc. 

These observed peculiarities can indicate that there is an instrument constituency behind this sustained popularity. Instrument constituencies are composed of actors dedicated to the promotion of a particular policy instrument across different issue areas and jurisdictions (Voß & Simons, 2014). Actors are amalgamated by their commitment to a particular policy instrument or a particular way of implementing certain policies. Their presence was most notably demonstrated for some policy instruments like emissions trading systems (Voß & Simons, 2014), and some social policy instruments (Béland & Howlett, 2016). In line with previous applications, this paper includes a casual case study on the entrepreneurship policies of the OECD Countries in the last three decades. To find empirical evidence it relies on the large number of available policy documents on the topic, using recommendations and position papers, evaluations, as well as scholarly articles.

0,"A number of ambitious climate actions (European Green Deal, Paris Agreement etc.) have been proposed in recent years. However, it is also the case that the major drivers of climate change have been known since the early 1900s (Bonneuil and Fressoz, 2016). Even though this understanding had become incontrovertible by the mid-1960s (Robinson and Robbins, 1968), very little has been accomplished in terms of stemming Greenhouse emissions. Given this historical background, one can have serious doubts about the effectiveness of any newly proposed initiative. So, is there any hope for averting climate change? This paper attempts to argue that there is at least one reason for some optimism. The world has just witnessed what may be regarded the two most important global crises since the second World War – the Great Financial Crisis and the on-going COVID crises. I argue that the large-scale state interventions that took place as part of these crises have changed the horizon of expectation (Kosseleck, 1985) and future imaginaries (Beckert, 2013), especially as far as state interventions and international restrictions are concerned. It is the memory of these two previous crises which influences what actions are deemed possible to combat the current and future crises of climate change. In order to develop this argument, this paper develops a conceptualization of the important interlinkages between crises, memory, and imagined futures and it subsequently relates these to current policy discussions of major climate change initiatives.",European University Institute,,,,,,,,European University Institute,,Tobias Pforr,,,,,,,,Tobias Pforr,,Governance,Political Economy,Political Sociology,Climate Change,Memory,Narratives,Capitalism,,"Is there hope for climate action: The role of crises, memory, and imagined futures",https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63266&EventID=185
0,"The question of which interest groups gain access to policymakers - and on what basis - remains one of fundamental importance to scholars of representative democracy and those interested in the quality of democratic decision-making. Research has shown that private firms and business associations in contemporary democracies devote more resources to lobbying and are consistently over-represented among the groups that policymakers meet with and invite to give evidence during the policy process (Baumgartner et al 2009). Despite their prevalence, there is less research on which firms engage in the political process and succeed in gaining access to policymakers. 

In this study, we examine a potential determinant of corporate political access that has received limited attention to date, namely a firm’s socio-political reputation. Over the past two decades firms and especially large, transnational corporations have come under increasing pressure to demonstrate that they are responsible social actors that seek to make profit while contributing to—or at least not detracting from—the public good. While research suggests that a firms’ reputation for corporate social responsibility (CSR) can help the organization maintain good relations with its customers, employees, and investors (Minor & Morgan 2011), surprisingly little research has examined how this reputation for responsibility affects firms’ relations with policymakers.  

Specifically we explore the relationship between the CSR reputations of large transnational corporations listed in the FTSE350 and the access these firms are granted to UK policymakers in both the executive and legislature. For this purpose, we created a novel database containing information about which large firms, British politicians have invited to give testimony to the committees of the UK (Westminster) parliament and to meet with government officials between 2010 to 2017. We further collected information about firms’ environmental, social and governance (ESG) ratings as well as media reported scandals. We use descriptive and multivariate statistical analysis to shed light on the extent to which firms’ reputation for responsibility translates into political access as well as how the influence of a firm’s socio-political reputation varies across the legislature and executive offices. We identify a clear, positive relationship between ESG ratings and firm access, and demonstrate that the effects of negative CSR controversies depend on the venue in question. We complement this quantitative analysis with interview data taken from 20 UK legislative and executive officials to gain insight into why a company’s reputation for social responsibility is valued by some policymakers as well as how a company’s CSR policies and commitments shape its interactions with policymakers.",University of Glasgow,University of Glasgow,University of Glasgow,,,,,,University of Glasgow,,Alvise Favotto,Kelly Kollman,Fraser McMillan,,,,,,Alvise Favotto,,Interest Groups,Business,Lobbying,,,,,,Is Virtue its Own Reward?

0,"Party ministers are powerful delegates of their parties in executive offices. As such, they are expected to work for their principals and secure the fulfilment of their party pledges. The previous studies, however, showed that not all ministers are the same and their personal characteristics, such as partisanship or previous political experience play role in the effectiveness of ministers to fulfil their party pledges. 
This paper adds new variables into the study of the impact of elite characteristics on party pledge fulfilment. I argue that the ministerial work takes a lot of time and attention of ministers, and therefore, if ministers simmultaneously deal with additional political work and hold multiple offices, this likely leads to their worse performance at the ministry and lower level of their party pledge fulfilment. This basic relationship, however, does not necessarily mean if the ministers hold positions in the parliamentary committees that are related to their portfolio. If ministers are members of related parliamentary committees, they can take the opportunity to influence the other members of the committee especially when the ministerial law proposals are discused. As well, if ministers serve within the party leadership, they can use their intra-party authority and position within the coalition on the behalf of their party.
The expectations are tested on the joint dataset of party pledges and ministerial characteristics in three governments in the Czech Republic (formed after 2007, 2010, 2013). The effect of simultaneous holding of political positions within party leadership, local and regional level, and seats in ministry-related and non-related parliamentary committees on party pledge fulfilment is tested with the use of binary logistic regression.

A closer analysis of this issue leads to very interesting conclusions about Kant's perception of the entire international sphere.

0,"Recently, various Central and European (CEE) EU members have experienced a regression of democratic quality, often resulting in the emergence of competitive (semi-)authoritarian regimes with an explicitly illiberal governing ideology. This has often been accompanied by various interlinked processes such as the “cartelization of the state” and “hollowing” of civil society.  Labelled by Sata and Karolewski (2020) as “caesarean politics”, some CEE governments engaged in clientelism characterized by elaborate systems of rewards and punishments, the predominance of informal networks, and state capture, potentially resulting in atrophic party-civil society relationships. 

While literature on CEE organized interests has boomed recently (Rozbicka et al. 2020; Dobbins & Riedel 2021), we are only beginning to understand how interest groups are adapting to democratic backsliding, political centralization and the closure of the political opportunity structure. Based on a survey of more than 400 interest groups operating in Poland, Hungary, Czechia and Slovenia, we explore whether organizations shut out from policy-making in backsliding countries are recalibrating their strategies. Specifically, we are interested in whether organizations with intense ties with opposition parties in countries more heavily affected by backsliding are shifting their lobbying activities to alternative advocacy arenas. In addition, we explore whether strong ties with the opposition (as a proxy for not being politically on board with illiberal, national-conservative governments) stimulates organizational learning processes such as professionalization, expertise accumulation and increasing cooperation with like-minded organizations.

0,"Legal acts adopted by EU institutions and bodies are increasingly underpinned by intricate and uncertain empirical assessments. They also embody interpretations of complex legal frameworks replete with abstruse scientific or technical notions requiring expert knowledge. The EU co-legislator’s response is a proliferation of formally administrative boards of appeals in EU agencies vested with decision-making powers. These boards are supposed to combine legal and scientific or technical expertise, such as with regard to the risk regulation of chemicals or the supervision of financial institutions. Previous research has demonstrated that these bodies can be equipped with relatively strong safeguards of decision-making independence as well as they may replicate the techniques and procedural practices of judicial review. In this context, the question arises then as to how the EU Courts should approach the second-order judicial review of the administrative review by the boards of appeals. Based on the existing case-law of the EU Courts and boards of appeal, this paper examines the pros and cons represented by three models of the judicial review of scientific uncertainty: (1) the non-review and deference to expert EU bodies’ empirical discretion, even if no prior specialised administrative review exists; (2) the limited second-order judicial review of specialised administrative review; (3) the complete judicial review, even if prior administrative review has been put in place. The paper argues that the model of limited second-order judicial review of specialised administrative review would provide the most efficient allocation of limited resources and would guarantee an optimal interplay of assets legitimising EU legal acts based on uncertain science.",University of Copenhagen,,,,,,,,University of Copenhagen,,Michal Krajewski,,,,,,,,Michal Krajewski,,European Union,Executives,Governance,Public Administration,,,,,Judicial and Administrative Review of Scientific Uncertainty: Complementarity or Duplication?,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64610&EventID=185
0,"The powers granted to the Commission, the ECB, and independent regulatory authorities in the context of the financial crisis have increasingly been challenged in front of the CJEU. What standard of review is the Court applying to the measures resulting from the exercise of such powers? As they often include complex economic assessments, it could be expected that the Court carries out only a limited review. Traditionally, complex technical assessments have in fact been subject to light-touch scrutiny, grounded in the need to respect the decision-maker’s technical discretion. More recently, however, areas such as risk regulation and competition law, have witnessed an evolution of the space granted to technical discretion, leading to a stricter scrutiny of complex technical (scientific and economic) assessments. The paper sets out to investigate whether this is the case also in relation to the EMU. In particular, it inquires how the concept of technical discretion is framed by the Court in that context, on what grounds such discretion is granted to the EU administration and, in particular, whether the Court’s approach to complex assessment in the context of the EMU is following a similar trajectory of enhanced judicial control.",University of Amsterdam,,,,,,,,University of Amsterdam,,Marta Morvillo,,,,,,,,Marta Morvillo,,European Union,Executives,Euro,Eurozone,,,,,Judicial review of complex assessments in the EMU: a bastion of technical discretion?,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64609&EventID=185
0,"Regulatory agencies usually operate in complex thematic fields (e.g., telecommunications, energy, capital markets), that are often managed by a narrow circle of experts and bureaucrats who deal with them on a daily operational basis, consequently multiplying information asymmetry problems. Therefore, the knowledge and experience of judges has become a matter of concern with regard to the increased complexity of evidence and technical and scientific insights needed for an adequate understanding of increasingly evidence-based regulatory policies. Regulatory bodies develop and implement policies while continually facing the prospect that their actions might be reviewed and may be overturned by the judiciary.

The paper explores the relationships between the judiciary and regulatory agencies in relation to judicial review of administrative decisions. It sheds light on how law-and-courts professionals and regulatory bodies spot potential challenges, how they handle litigation, how legal and technical-scientific rationalities interact and what meanings are given to the judicialization of regulatory decision-making.

The main theoretical frameworks for the study were regulatory space and institutional logics. Divergent interpretations of organizational missions are more likely when an organizational field is characterized by multiple institutional logics, each one institutionalized to some degree (DiMaggio, 1988; Stryker, 2000). We also employ the concept of regulatory space, an approach built by organizations, people and events acting together and negotiating boundaries in a specific set of regulatory issues subject to public decisions (Hancher & Moran, 1989; Vibert, 2014), because it is difficult to fully understand the role of mutual influences from the perspective of the courts or regulators alone.

Aiming at analyzing perceptions about how regulatory litigation is undertaken in Brazil, 21 interviews were carried out with law-and-courts professionals and officials of seven Brazilian regulatory agencies. Brazil is a suitable locus for exploring divergences and boundaries among prominent players in regulatory litigation. The Brazilian Constitution allows extensive judicial review of administrative acts since no threat to a right may be excluded from judicial review and any party in a relationship with the public administration enjoys the protection of due process of law.

The paper discusses how key players – regulatory officials, judges and agencies’ attorneys – give meanings to the judicialization of regulatory decision-making. Different expectations were in the background for accounts offered by the respondents and their perceptions have an important impact on how the regulatory system operates and on the way in which rules are made and reviewed.

By examining the boundaries and divergences among them, the study extends the literature on judicial review on regulation matters in aspects such as: highlights the relevance of the role performed by the agencies’ attorneys in bridging the gap between legal and technical rationalities; shows how powerful economic agents exploit contradictions in the regulatory arena in order to obtain the reinterpretation of rules in their favor; suggests an increasing interest by judges in weighing non-strictly legal arguments and developing standards regarding what guiding principles might be adopted to improve the quality of the regulatory authorities’ administrative decision-making process.",University of Brasilia,University of Brasilia,,,,,,,University of Brasilia,,Tomas Guimarães,JEOVAN ASSIS SILVA,,,,,,,JEOVAN ASSIS SILVA,,Institutions,Public Administration,Regulation,Courts,Judicialisation,,,,Judicial Review of Regulatory Matters: Divergences and Boundaries between Courts and Regulatory Agencies,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64300&EventID=185
0,"Judicialization is commonly understood in two ways. Something judicializes if it previously was outside the realm of law and it becomes a legal phenomenon. In the field of international relations, judicialization has been used in this way. Judicialization is also understood as appealing to court to solve a particular dispute. In both ways, policy and decision making in the field of spatial planning have judicialized in the Netherlands during the past decades. Environmental law and spatial planning law now canalize decision making to a large extent, and disputes are increasingly settled by courts. In this paper we take a closer look at the contexts in which spatial planning disputes judicialize. The existence of a transformative effect of judicialization of a dispute policy-making is undisputed, both in the academic community as in practice. However, we argue for the need to distinguish different types of judicialization. This is necessary in order to understand why some disputes entangle when they judicialize, while others do not, and some decision making processes benefit from judicialization in terms of legitimacy, while others do not.

0,"Courts in the UK and elsewhere have played an increasingly prominent role in the political regulation of public services such as education, health and social care. This development has fuelled a juridification of the public sector as members of the public seek recourse to the courts and the broader legal system to right perceived injustices. Juridification has also made its presence felt in public services via the spread of legal discourse in the shape of consumerism, contractualisn and an ever-evolving web of accountabilities. This development has attracted the attention of scholars across disciplines such as law, public administration and sociology, which have explored its implications for issues such as service quality, administrative burden and regulatory over-reach. Debates so far are often couched in the context of new public management and/or new governance, conceptual lenses through which the various pathologies of juridification can be critically examined.

An important strand of this work explores the relation between juridification and street-level bureaucracy, in this case those who serve at the front lines of public services – teachers, social workers, medical professionals and so on. Given their role in policy making, a focus on street-level bureaucrats in the context of juridification makes sense, as they often wield considerable discretionary power in the conduct of their professional duties. But what tends to be overlooked in this analysis is their role as mediators between the public and the public sector - to what extent has increasing juridification impacted on these relations and what are the consequences of this imposition?     
     
This is a significant question as there is already a strong evidence base which points to street-level bureaucrats as moral arbiters of both public policy and public behaviour, a form of discretionary power than can sit uneasily alongside the force of legal accountability. Using the author’s own research as well as the broader public policy literature, the current paper will explore the intersection of these forms of accountability, in particular the ways in which juridification impacts the moral universe of public relationality.",University of Glasgow,,,,,,,,University of Glasgow,,Mark Murphy,,,,,,,,Mark Murphy,,Public Administration,Public Policy,Regulation,Judicialisation,,,,,"Juridification, discretionary power and the moral universe of public sector professionalism",https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65162&EventID=185
0,"Since the early 1990s, an increasing number of national and subnational democracies establish institution for future generations, such as the Parliamentary Committee for the Future in Finland, the Ombudsperson for Future Generations in Hungary, and the Future Generations Commissioner for Wales. These bodies or offices are supposed to help to consider the needs of future generations alongside the needs of current constituencies. In doing so, they can be considered to make democracies more inclusive and amenable to more sustainable decision-making, strengthening the long-term orientation of politics and policy. As such, they can be regarded as democratic innovations in their own right.  
By considering the needs of future generations and integrating them into the political decision-making process, these institutions are often described as a potential remedy for what is known as democratic myopia – the tendency of democracies to focus on short-term gains and discount long-term developments. Whether these expectations are justified, is an open question, though. Since strong institutions for future generations might further limit the scope of politicians to meet the immediate needs of their electorate, real influence may not even be intended. The credibility of institutions for future generations – and of those who decide on their design – therefore hinges on the capacities and competencies with which they are formally endowed when they are established.
For the first time, this study compares 25 former and current institutions for future generations along several dimensions in order to assess their capacities to influence policy-making. These dimensions include the roles of institutions for future generations at different stages of the public policy process (from agenda-setting to evaluation), the types of political instruments at their disposal (from advice to suspensive vetoes or rights of investigation), their legal entrenchment (from bylaws to constitutions), the branches of government they are affiliated with, as well as their organisational structure and resources. The results show a considerable variety of institutions for future generations along these dimensions, while institutions with comprehensive roles and instruments and strong legal bases are rather rare. Overall, these democratic innovations should not be overburdened with expectations - sometimes they seem to represent more cosmetic than far-reaching reforms of policy-making. However, institutions for future generations do not always act on their own. In some cases, a democracy hosts more than one institution for future generations, allowing them to combine their strengths and compensate for each other’s weaknesses to a certain extent. In addition, the institutions’ formal capacities and competencies can only tell parts of their stories.",Leuphana Universität Lüneburg,,,,,,,,Leuphana Universität Lüneburg,,Michael Rose,,,,,,,,Michael Rose,,Comparative Politics,Democracy,Green Politics,Institutions,Comparative Perspective,Decision Making,Empirical,Policy-Making,Just new democratic bells and whistles?

0,"Large-scale energy storage is a novel and relatively fast-growing technology with the potential to exert a considerable impact on our energy system and society as a whole. At this moment, stakeholders of this technology are creating visions on the form, the application, and the societal impact of large-scale energy storage. These images of the future serve important functions as they mobilize resources, create incentives, formulate goals, specify relevant actors, and allocate roles. Prominent actors emphasize that large-scale energy storage is 'the holy grail', 'something that it’s going to be huge', 'THE technology needed to realize a sustainable energy grid'. However, at the same time, these actors express the importance of 'plugging it into the present system', 'minimizing resistance', and 'something that is not yet a point of discussion'. There seems to be a friction between the imagined prominent position of this technology and the needed deliberative change embedded in emerging visions to accelerate the desired transition.
To advance our understanding of the function of visions within social-technical transitions, this paper examines the early dynamics in the envisioning process regarding the emerging technology of large-scale energy storage in the Netherlands. The analysis focuses on deconstructing the emerging visions in terms of their illustrative problem, imagine future, driving ideologies, radicalism, and embedded storylines. Data is collected through 30 semi-structured interviews with a variety of stakeholders in the energy storage community. 
The paper argues that stakeholders who promote and develop large-scale energy storage downplay the societal impact this technology will have, stressing its incremental nature. Visualizing the absence of conflict and depoliticizing the issue to merely a technical question might be a deliberative effort to close off the visualization process. While understandable from the perspective of trying to minimize societal resistance, this way of envisioning the technologies future may also adversely impede the technologies success in creating the sustainable future it so hopes to accomplish. After all, it is hard to enthuse, convince and mobilize the public enough to realize a radically different future within an envisioning process downplaying its own radical potential. 
The paper contributes to current work in the field of social-technical studies on new ways of understanding the process of envisioning, going beyond ex-post descriptions of imagined futures. In doing so, this research aims to contribute to the literature on the role of visions for technological innovations within social-technical transitions.",Tilburg University,,,,,,,,Tilburg University,,Anieke Kranenburg,,,,,,,,Anieke Kranenburg,,Conflict,Democracy,Governance,Policy Analysis,Public Policy,Technology,Energy Policy,Policy-Making,Just plug in the holy grail?

0,"Thought experiments are often criticised, e.g. for being intuition pumps (Dennett 1995), for excessive simplicity (Goodin 1982, 8-12), and for unreliability (Machery 2017, 45-148). In a paper I gave at ECPR 2016 in Prague (where I co-organised the first ever panels in this nascent section, with Keith Dowding), I addressed these important concerns with a new methodology for thought experiments. However, whenever I present this paper, most questions involve whether we should be doing thought experiments in the first place.

We thus need a more foundational defence of thought experiments which explains that they are necessary and desirable (even though many actual thought experiments are silly or flawed). I start by presenting a new typology of thought experiments, by combining and amending the frameworks of Norton (1991, 131) and Gendler (2000, 25-7). One advantage of this new typology is to highlight *conceptual* thought experiments, e.g. for testing definitions. Conceptual thought experiments are mostly ignored in the methodological literature on thought experiments (though cf. Brendel 2004, 102-3). Yet they are incredibly widespread in political theory and beyond (e.g. Feinberg 1985, 10-49 on what counts as harm or offence).

Conceptual thought experiments are vital because they help us test general claims, e.g. ‘Corruption is the misuse of public office for private gain’. Such general claims need to be tested, with actual or hypothetical examples. Another part of my argument is to reject the apparent difference between actual and hypothetical examples. ‘Actual’ examples always leave out some variables for the sake of simplicity, and even then we regularly have to amend the actual example by tweaking the variables – hence rendering it hypothetical. We could hardly test definitions without conceptual thought experiments.

The same applies to *normative* thought experiments, which are similarly vital, because they help us test general normative claims, e.g. ‘Do as you like provided you do not harm others’. Such general claims also needed testing, with actual or hypothetical examples, and once again, even actual examples are likely to become hypothetical very quickly. 

The question of whether our judgements/intuitions are reliable remains a major concern, one which I cannot fully address in the present paper. But I do tackle it in two surprising ways. First, I show that in conceptual experiments we often *want* to pump (linguistic) intuitions to the surface. Consider the standard definition of corruption – the misuse of public office for private gain. This excludes the misuse of public office for *party* gain. Yet most of us would feel that such cases are also corrupt, e.g. politicians accepting money for their parties in exchange for policy influence. Second, sometimes we pump an intuition to the surface precisely to show that it is *wrong* - another underappreciated form of thought experiment (e.g. Hobbes’s man on a sinking ship, who *does* act freely, Hobbes then shows).

In short, the paper accepts many problems with thought experiments but justifies some of them as necessary and desirable.",Kings College London,,,,,,,,Kings College London,,Adrian Blau,,,,,,,,Adrian Blau,,Democracy,Political Methodology,Political Theory,Freedom,Methods,Corruption,Experimental Design,Normative Theory,Justifying (some) thought experiments,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=62527&EventID=185
0,"The main purpose of this paper is to bring into relief the difficulties faced by generous interpretations of the Kantian problem of poverty and to propose an alternative interpretation which a) agrees with some generous interpretations that Kant’s juridical treatment of poverty is to be understood by analogy with his juridical treatment of slavery, but which b) departs from generous interpretations in general by arguing that this analogy is not to be understood in terms of ‘dependence’ as such, but in terms of ‘depersonification’. More specifically, it argues that what makes slavery and poverty unjust for Kant is not that they entail a human being finding herself (completely) dependent on the choice of another human being, but that they entail a human being being deprived of her juridical personality. The Kantian problem of poverty is ultimately a problem of depersonification, and this problem of depersonification does not arise in all complete dependence relations.","Department of Political Science, Université Laval",,,,,,,,"Department of Political Science, Université Laval",,Sylvie Loriaux,,,,,,,,Sylvie Loriaux,,Political Theory,Social Justice,Freedom,Ethics,,,,,Kant on Poverty and Social Justice,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64699&EventID=185

The paper will focus first on the distinction Kant makes between “the right to be a permanent visitor” and the “temporary right of sojourn.” Though the Kantian hospitality “is not a question of philanthropy but of right,” yet it is confined to a claim to temporary residency. Furthermore, Kant’s universal right to hospitality is viewed as an imperfect moral duty, i.e., imposes no obligation upon us to offer shelter to those who are in danger.  Second, the paper will elucidate the dilemmas the Kantian right to hospitality is caught considering the contemporary refugee crisis.

0,"Apart from Jon Elster, it is virtually impossible to find references to enthusiasm in academic works on psychology or social theory of the 20th and 21st centuries.
Enthusiasm, however, is not a new concept. Prominent philosophers of the Enlightenment, such as Hume, devoted considerable attention to it. The most notable case, however, is Kant, who referred to such motivation in several works. For example, as he states in the Critique of the Power of Judgment: ‘The idea of the good with affect is called enthusiasm. This state of mind seems to be sublime, so much so that it is commonly maintained that without it nothing great can be accomplished’. Additionally, in Anthropology, History, and Education, Kant states with regard to the enthusiasm of the French revolutionaries that it ‘shakes everything and goes beyond all bounds’. In the Critique of the Power of Judgment, he moreover adds that ‘enthusiasm, like any other affect, is blind, either in the choice of its end, or, if this is given by Reason, in its implementation; for it is that movement of the mind that makes it incapable of engaging in free consideration of principles’.
More recently, Jon Elster has published several relevant works where he argues that enthusiasm is very probably an emotion (incomprehensibly ignored by contemporary literature) and that it plays a key role in important processes of collective action such as revolutions, constituent processes and others.
In a similar vein, this paper attempts to argue that enthusiasm, as well as rationality and other emotions such as fear, played a crucial role in the period of the Catalan independence process that culminated in the holding of the referendum on 1 October 2017 and the subsequent failed declaration of independence (which resulted in the imprisonment and flight into exile of the main leaders of the movement).
The contribution of this work is manifold. On the one hand, it provides new evidence suggesting that Kantian enthusiasm plays a crucial role in large-scale political processes. Secondly, it provides evidence that enthusiasm may indeed be considered an emotion and, particularly, that enthusiasm can be triggered by anger and frustration.",Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona,,,,,,,,Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona,,Jordi Tena-Sánchez,,,,,,,,Jordi Tena-Sánchez,,National Identity,Political Psychology,Mobilisation,,,,,,Kantian Enthusiasm in the Pro-independence Catalan Movement,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63056&EventID=185
0,"In ""Political Liberalism"", Rawls characterises the problem of political liberalism as whether it is possible for citizens with ""deeply opposed though reasonable comprehensive doctrines"" to ""live together and all affirm the political conception of a constitutional regime"" (PL, xvii). I argue that the theory of karma can provide a reason for its adherents to support a political conception of a constitutional regime. The argument is that the theory of karma and our ignorance of our stock of karma entails that we are ignorant of our future place in the social order. In particular, we cannot rule out that we may be the most disadvantaged because of our religion or caste or socio-economic status. If we cannot rule out that we may be the most disadvantaged in those ways, we have a reason to affirm a regime that protects the rights of the most disadvantaged and seeks to ameliorate their condition, i.e. a political conception of a constitutional regime. Thus, the theory of karma provides a reason to affirm a political conception of a constitutional regime.

In parallel to this strand, I argue that informal IOs find a way through and rely on bottom-up systems of knowledge management: inter-personal relationships, storytelling, and external partners. Based on interview data, this paper shows that non-conventionally organized IOs develop their own unique mixture of strategies. In fact, interviewees claim to have been affected less by the COVID-induced switch to online meetings compared to formal IOs. The informality and relational nature of these IOs may insulate them, whereas formal IOs’ reliance on the physical workplace can put them at a disadvantage.

0,"The COVID-19 pandemic put a strain on international research by limiting scholars’ ability to travel and increasing the uncertainty they face when working on foreign territories. While volatile environments and safety concerns that predate the pandemic have been strong predicaments to researching the Middle East, I argue in this chapter that COVID-19 may have provided an opportunity for fairer, more equally weighted research practices. Notably, practical constraints and forced immobility highlighted the crucial skills and relevance of local researchers and communities and created prospects for participatory and inclusive collaborative projects and co-production of knowledge. These reflections build on my experience as an early career researcher in the UK and emerged from remote investigation in northern Syria during the first year of COVID-19. I highlight the opportunities and challenges of collaborative research between Europe and the Middle East – focusing on issues of privilege, inclusion and positionality – in the process of creating ‘glocal’ and balanced knowledge.

0,"In this paper, I try to understand the intersection between ‘integration’ in legal terms, and how ‘non-citizens’ (Anderson, 2013) situate themselves in terms of belonging vis a vis the genealogy of this legal structure that renders individuals at once inside and outside of the normative power that constitutes a body politique. More specifically, how do labor- and forced migrants from former Yugoslavia negotiate ‘integration’ in Switzerland in legal and social terms? Former-Yugoslavs constitute not only a comparatively large number of ‘non-citizens’ in Switzerland. Individuals from-and-with-connections to this community also embody numerous labels and categories of migrant that statistical databases, the media, and legal practices attach to them. Due to, and in an effort to illustrate the fluid character of how labeling and categorizing ‘non-citizens’ affects belonging empirically, this article builds on the theoretical reflections by Rebecca Hamlin, Katy Long and Stephen Castles (Hamlin 2021; Long, 2013; Castles, 2003). Key-findings in this paper illustrate a two-tiered narrative: ‘non-citizens’ maintain their pursuit of not attracting attention to their persona – a strategy that lets individuals disappear within the larger society. At the same time, and in conjunction with the tightening legal practice of belonging formally to the Swiss body politique, interlocutors do not simply acquiesce to the exclusionary legal codes that affect ‘non-citizens’. Instead, interviewees actively construct, and maintain Swiss-(and Europe-)wide connections and networks to better understand the legal and administrative backdrop, but also to actively influence integration governance in Switzerland (and Europe).

This paper is based on a grounded theory approach that builds on ethnographic research conducted during cultural gatherings including movie screenings, music venues, readings, as well as in third spaces such as beauty salons, and online forums since 2019. Additional data stems from repeated in-depth, semi-structured and situational interviews with to date 40 individuals I had met during the above-mentioned social gatherings and other third spaces, as well as further snow-ball sampling. In all, I spoke to 18 males, and 22 females, all of whom had arrived in Switzerland between the 1960s and late 1990s. The project was approved the Human Subjects Committee at the University St.Gallen. 

Ethnographic insights and interviews are triangulated with the Wednesday News - For Our Citizens in the World (Vijesnik u Srijedu – Za Naše Gradjane u Svijetu) newspaper series, published between March 24th 1971 and December 31st 1977. I chose this timeframe not only to triangulate interviews and ethnographic research, but also because the number of Yugoslavs in Switzerland had increased from 1’169 individuals to 60’619 – an increase to the power of 51. The 1970s are further characterized by the tightening of labor migration admission in the aftermath of the Schwarzenbach Initiative – a rightwing, populist initiative that sought to curb labor migration significantly. In other words, while I interview interlocutors that had come between the 1960s and late 1990s, I specifically focus on the 1970s for the above reasons, and the 1990s due to the tightening legal restrictions that since characterize integration governance in Switzerland",Universität St Gallen,,,,,,,,Universität St Gallen,,Sandra King-Savic,,,,,,,,Sandra King-Savic,,Integration,Qualitative,Empirical,,,,,,Labels and Categories: ‘Integrating’ Citizens into the Body Politique,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64492&EventID=185
0,"Populist politicians often claim that mainstream politics are too complex and far away from ‘ordinary’ citizens. Therefore, populist actors aim to be closer to the ‘ordinary’ citizens and act in their will. One strategy of populist actors is to simplify political problems. This can be achieved through oversimplification of complex problems, but also through using simpler language. Current studies are divided whether populist actors actually use simpler language in their rhetorical strategies or not. Thus, there is much theoretical and anecdotal evidence about the simplification of populist rhetoric. Also, quantitative evidence has been provided presenting, however, mixed results. This paper aims to shed light on these contradictory results by looking at parliamentary debates in Germany. Analyzing a huge text corpus of parliamentary debates from March 1991 to December 2018 this research paper aims to answer the following research questions: Do populist actors use simpler language than other political actors in parliamentary debates? And to what extend does simple language transmit between political actors leading to overall more simplified parliamentary debates? To answer the research questions quantitative text analysis strategies are employed using different measures of language complexity and political sophistication. The paper poses the hypothesis that populist actors use simpler language than other actors following their ideal of a simplified world between ‘good’ and ‘evil’. Also, it argues that simple language does not transmit from populist actors towards mainstream actors. It rather has the opposite effect.",European University Institute,,,,,,,,European University Institute,,Rebecca Kittel,,,,,,,,Rebecca Kittel,,Political Parties,Populism,Communication,,,,,,Language Complexity in Parliament: Use and Effect of Simple Language Among Populist and Mainstream Actors in Parliamentary Debates,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64691&EventID=185
0,"Against the backdrop of the recent constitutionalization of the EU migration and asylum policy domain, scholars have since 2015 observed the tendency of the EU executive to choose soft law policy ‘instruments’ and ‘tools’ at the expense of hard law. This (re)turn to informality is particularly visible in return and readmission cooperation with third countries, where the EU has since 2016 negotiated a number of ‘readmission arrangements’ with countries such as Turkey, Ethiopia, Ivory Coast, Bangladesh, the Gambia, Guinea or Afghanistan. Legal scholars have underscored the potential negative impact of this turn in terms of human rights protection and, particularly, of diminished accountability of the EU executive. As the use of soft law sidelines EU institutions such as the European Parliament or the European Court of Justice to the benefit of the European Commission or the Council, some Members of the Parliament and international civil society organizations have questioned the (democratic) legitimacy of such practice. Executive EU institutions have however justified the use of arrangements on grounds of efficiency and political expediency (particularly regarding relations with third countries). With this paper I aim to investigate two interrelated questions: 1) how and why has informalization become a dominant paradigm in EU readmission policy; 2) how has this turn been justified and legitimized to other institutions and the general public. To answer these questions, I will draw on a qualitative analysis of three sets of data: policy documents produced by the EU institutions and other stakeholders; recordings of events where different EU institutional actors discussed readmission policy (e.g. Parliamentary plenary meetings, Committee meetings); interviews with EU policy officials and practitioners.",University of Amsterdam,,,,,,,,University of Amsterdam,,Davide Gnes,,,,,,,,Davide Gnes,,European Politics,European Union,Executives,Foreign Policy,Migration,Public Administration,European Parliament,Policy-Making,Law versus Politics?

0,"A major rationale behind the principles of direct effect and supremacy is to promote equal legal protection among EU citizens of different nationality and residence by empowering private litigants to vindicate their European rights before the Court of Justice of the EU (CJEU). Effective legal protection, however, also requires competent legal counsel. Since good lawyers cost money, access to legal counsel is most likely unequal to some unknown extent. Despite long-standing interest in the role of the legal profession in European integration at large, research has only recently focused on how lawyers shape day-to-day judicial politics. The extent to which the quality of legal counsel affects the proceedings before the CJEU and their outcomes is therefore surprisingly uncertain.
This paper explores the access to legal counsel and its impact in CJEU proceedings. First, it examines how access is distributed among various kinds of litigants with different financial resources. We expect that wealthy litigants, such as corporations and lobby organizations, afford higher quality legal counsel than individuals and advocacy groups. We corroborate this hypothesis by comparing the average experience and prestige of the lawyers representing each type of litigant. Second, using all direct actions – including appeals – decided by the European Court of Justice (ECJ) in the past 20 years, the paper examines to what extent the quality of legal counsel matters for winning a lawsuit. Contrary to our expectation, we find that having more experienced and more prestigious counsel does not significantly raise the odds of winning when considering only private litigants. These findings raise intriguing puzzles. Why does it barely pay to lawyer up? And why do wealthy litigants do it anyway?
The analysis is based on preliminary evidence from a new data-set containing, inter alia, procedural and party information for all proceedings as well as the outcomes of direct actions decided by the ECJ between 2002 and 2021.",University of Vienna,University of Vienna,,,,,,,University of Vienna,,Henning Deters,Moritz Klock,,,,,,,Henning Deters,,European Politics,European Union,Courts,Jurisprudence,,,,,Lawyering Up Before the CJEU.

0,"There is a consensus that a minimal knowledge of political events is necessary for citizens to remain politically involved (Delli Carpini & Keeter, 1996). Knowledge of party positions is particularly important for citizens in order to cast a substantively informed vote (Bartels, 1986; Rabinowitz & Macdonald, 1989). One period when they may learn about party positions is during election campaigns (Jenssen, 2009). The aim of this paper is therefore to investigate whether citizens indeed learn about the party system during campaigns and whether this effect is contingent on voter characteristics. Furthermore, I do not only focus on citizens but also investigate the supply side by examining whether campaign learning is more apparent when parties devote more attention to an issue during the campaign. Specifically, this study will contribute to existing research on campaign learning in three ways. First, rather than using the predominant operationalization of asking citizens three to five knowledge questions on institutions and actors, I will focus on policy position knowledge, the ability of respondents to position parties on a large number of policy proposals. Second, I am able to disentangle effects of different type of media channels because I possess detailed information on what type of media respondents used during the campaign. Finally, by means of a content analysis of campaign news, I will be able to also link the actual information provided during the campaign with voter data.
Two datasets will be used. First, I use a two-wave electoral survey in the Dutch-speaking part of Belgium. In both waves, respondents (n=1681) had to indicate the positions of seven main parties on 18 different policy proposals. The question format allows us to create a unique and accurate measure of voters’ party position knowledge. In addition, we asked respondents for several media channels how often they used them during the campaign to follow political news. Second, I will code the content of both newspapers and social media (facebook) with regard to the policy statements included in the surveys. This allows us to follow parties’ communication on these different issues. These policy statements were selected by journalists right before the start of the electoral campaign and allowed us to grasp the core issues of the electoral campaign. For the analysis, I will use auto-regressive models. Concretely, this means that I use the ability to accurately position parties on the different proposals in wave 1 to predict the accuracy in the second wave. Moreover, given that I stack the data – as each respondent ranks seven parties on 18 policy proposals and is thus included multiple times - I use cross-classified multilevel analysis.",Universiteit Antwerpen,,,,,,,,Universiteit Antwerpen,,Isaïa Jennart,,,,,,,,Isaïa Jennart,,Elections,Political Parties,Knowledge,Campaign,Quantitative,Communication,Public Opinion,Survey Research,Learning about policy positions through the news: how media content shapes voters’ knowledge of parties’ policy positions.,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64606&EventID=185
0,"Despite the increasing gender and ethnic diversity among MPs, there has been less progress for other under-represented groups, including people with disabilities who account for 17 per cent of Britons but less than 1 per cent of MPs (Campbell and Heath 2019) – compared to 11 per cent of peers (Purvis 2014). It reflects the strength of voters’ (and of party selectorate’s) scepticism about disabled politicians’ effectiveness (Durose et al. 2011; Campbell and Cowley 2014). This belief reflects deeper-seated prejudices about capacity of disabled people in general (Deal 2006). It is also reinforced by perceptions of institutional barriers – from issues of access to political communication – that hinder a disabled politician’s participation, thus, making them undesirable candidates (Durose et al. 2011). As a result, most candidates are reluctant to declare disability for fear of electoral penalty, thus, making disability almost invisible in the Commons, which only reinforces the idea that disabled people make for inadequate representatives. 
Disabilities in the House of Lords, and adjustments to accommodate disabled Peers, are more common stemming from the relatively high average age of peers associated with age-related physical and mental health conditions (Crewe 2005; Purvis 2014). The absence of electoral barriers to entry and life peerages encourages the House’s focus on enabling full participation of peers who are there to stay. There are opportunities for the House of Commons to learn from the Lords about how to accommodate disabled MPs while challenging preconceptions about the capacities of disabled politicians. This paper aims to identify which practices hinder and enable disabled parliamentarians in both Houses and examine which of them are present in the Lords but not in the Commons – and vice versa.

0,"Recent EU Directives propose that citizens and energy communities take a more active role in generation, self-consumption and demand-side flexibility. European R&D is supporting an increasing number of residential smart grid pilots, to test and try new configurations aimed at “untapping” the residential flexibility potential. 
The transition of a centralized supply-oriented energy system towards a more decentralized organization with increasing attention for the demand-side flexibility, is likely to cause friction and conflict. Based on action research in Dutch residential smart grid pilot projects, an analysis of current/recent institutional and policy changes, and on a review of recent literature, we discuss the residential smart grid pilot as a site of contestation where we identify potential conflicts in expectations, values, interests (which may translate into actual conflict in time). Taking a socio-technical perspective, we look at the ways in which these smart grid pilots shape and are shaped by both the providers of smart energy ‘solutions’and the diverse types of communities and household end-users, and how this is affected by institutional settings and changes in these (e.g. the transposition of EU Directives). Next, taking a pluralistic environmental justice perspective, we discuss how energy communities and citizens are enabled to participate in these new smart grids, addressing recognition of diverse needs, interests and capabilities. 
We distinguish three levels where mismatches, friction or even conflict occurs, illustrated with empirical material. First, at the smart grid project level, assumptions about household end-users result in propositions that are not in line with real user expectations, needs and capabilities (creating mismatches when the ‘smart grid solutions’ are not adopted by the users). A second level is the household itself, where levels of energy and digital proficiency are unevenly distributed among household members (often along gendered roles). Concentration of such expertise with one person, brings the risk of exclusion for other members, potentially undermining experienced control, comfort and trust. The third level is that of the energy community: even within ‘frontrunner‘ smart grid pilot communities, often only a minority is capable of understanding the technologies and digital arrangements and acting upon these. In view of the complexity of smart grid pilots, this raises the question about how to ensure that community interests and values are indeed in line with the course taken and how to effectively discuss and deliberate about this within an energy community. 
In the transposition of EU directives into national legislation and policy, there is little attention for tackling the above mentioned (potential) conflicts. The implications for the energy transition are that the identified frictions turn into more explicit conflicts and/or disengagement from users. We need design and policy practices that can strengthen the position of end-users in these negotiations and conflicts, if we consider residential smart grids not only as a tool to create value for the grid but also to create value for the citizens and communities involved – enabling them to adopt a more active role as energy citizens in the energy transition.",DuneWorks,,,,,,,,DuneWorks,,Sylvia Breukers,,,,,,,,Sylvia Breukers,,Energy Policy,Policy-Making,Transitional justice,,,,,,Learning from residential smart grid pilots as sites of contestation,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65049&EventID=185
0,"The last years, participatory democracy has been studied and promoted in order to improve the efficacy and legitimacy of policy decisions made through representative democracy, especially at the local level. That said, public deliberation in representative councils or parliaments remains fundamental. Public deliberation may be conceptualized as a debate and discussion aimed at producing reasonable, well-informed opinions in which participants are willing to revise preferences in light of discussion, new information, and claims made by fellow participants (Chambers, 2003). Learning, defined as an individual and collective process involving the enduring acquisition or modification of cognitive constructs such as beliefs and preferences (Moyson, 2017), is central in such a conceptualization (Gregorcic & Krašovec, 2016). However, fundamental differences in interests, goals and values, or even in ways of interpreting situations, almost invariably make such learning processes very challenging in formal deliberative settings.
What are the conditions and outcomes of learning in formal public deliberations within municipal councils, and how to model learning innovatively? To address this research question, a qualitative research design (Morse, 2003) was implemented: 13 semi-structured interviews were conducted with 17 Directors of the municipal administrations (i.e. civil servants) and municipal council Presidents (i.e. elected officials) in 13 municipalities in the Brussels-Capital Region, Belgium. The data were thematically analyzed (Paillé & Mucchielli, 2016). Then, the results were confirmed or nuanced based on four focus groups (Morgan, 1998) with the leaders of political parties in the municipal councils of two cities of the Region: Jette and Koekelberg.
Our findings suggest that 18 factors account for the acquisition of knowledge and opinion changes – i.e., learning – among municipal councilors on three levels, namely: the macro level, which represents the general environment in which the municipal councils operate (9 factors); the meso level, which refers to the interpersonal relations among councilors (4 factors); and the micro level, which represents the factors at the individual level (5 factors). For example, the political and legal experience of councilors, the cordiality and trust among them, and the partisanship to a regional or national political family have emerged as important determinants of learning among municipal councilors. Understanding and taking these factors into consideration may help to develop more collaborative and constructive deliberative environments and, ultimately, to facilitate decision-making based on stronger, shared evidence (Riche et al., 2020). Based on these findings, we look at some innovations susceptible to model learning in municipal councils and conclude with an agenda for future research.

0,"Western political theory’s engagement with settler colonialism has tended to consistently focus on its capitalist-materialist aspects viz., ownership of territory, extraction of resources, and the resultant genocidal erasure of Indigenous peoples of the land. Insofar as radical Indigenous responses to settler domination move between the wholesale rejection of colonial relationship on the one hand and direct action against the colonial state (blockades, protests, etc.) on the other – this paper argues that until the socio-psychopathological aspect of settler colonialism is uncovered and addressed, reconciliation itself will remain impossible or primarily settler-mandated (hence, rejected). Using Canadian settler society as its case study, and further utilizing the recent turn towards understanding the thing-based nature of democratic polities, the paper follows Winnicottian object relations psychoanalysis to trace the logic of settler colonial attachment to land-as-object. It argues that the desire for and dependence on land as a transitional object turns into exceptional Oedipal psychopathology since the attachment not only fails to get decathected but instead ensures itself through the structural regulation and hegemonic domination of the Indigenous peoples.",University of British Columbia,,,,,,,,University of British Columbia,,Ritwik Bhattacharjee,,,,,,,,Ritwik Bhattacharjee,,National Identity,Political Psychology,Political Theory,Critical Theory,Normative Theory,,,,Learning to let go: Diagnosing the socio-psychopathology of settler-colonial Canada,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=62921&EventID=185

We use survival analysis techniques to assess members of Congress’ duration in office and how legislators’ career paths have stabilized over time. Along with parliamentary career stabilization, the Chilean Congress has gradually move towards higher levels of institutionalization. These two intertwined processes have strengthened Congress’ influence in Chilean politics, which has led to an increasingly more constrained chief executive, which is clearly illustrated during the post-Pinochet era.

This article sheds new light on debates about the legitimacy and contestation of IOs by estimating the frequency of legitimacy-related claims towards IOs in media across the world. It further classifies the news referring to IOs based on whether they relate to central IO politics, ‘boots-on-the-ground’ policy/project implementation by IOs, or IOs’ unique expertise. By doing so, the article highlights the essential role of everyday, non-reflective and to a large extent non-political coverage of IOs in media, as compared to the rare instances in which a reflective critical or positive stance towards IOs is present in media. Empirical data used consist of a sample from approximately 4 million news articles from 150 countries in the years 2018-2021, selected based on audience geography data.

I argue that they are not, and my argument unfolds in four steps. First, I recover the liberal principle that authorities can be legitimate only if they make continuous good faith efforts to systematically respect all persons’ equal moral worth. Second, I contend that the injustice of the colonial imposition – what I call direct colonial injustice – paradigmatically violates this principle. Third, I discuss how colonial injustice can persist even after direct colonial injustice has ended – through what I call structural colonial injustice – and explain why structural colonial injustice also violates my principle of legitimate authority. Finally, I analyse how structural colonial injustice can operate both within and beyond state boundaries, suggest that such injustice is ubiquitous in today’s world, and argue that powerful Western states bear responsibilities to remedy it. So long as they fail to make good faith efforts towards such a remedy, they cannot claim legitimate authority over the victims of colonial injustice, who must therefore be presumed to have self-defensive rights to evade and resist their border regimes.",European University Institute,,,,,,,,European University Institute,,Lukas Schmid,,,,,,,,Lukas Schmid,,Migration,Political Theory,Immigration,Ethics,Normative Theory,,,,"Legitimate Authority, Colonial Injustice, and Immigration Enforcement",https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=62318&EventID=185

Drawing on original membership surveys of the League in Italy and the Sweden Democrats (SD), I show that feeling stigmatised affects negatively the levels of activism and the ambition to stand as candidates of PRR party members, regardless of their party’s stigmatisation. However, it reduces the aspiration to hold intra-party offices only among SD members.

0,"One of the main goals of Ronald Reagan's presidency was to initiate conservative revolution in federal courts in order to ""re-write the Constitution"" (Schwartz 1988). Although the President was able to make four appointments to the Supreme Court, influencing its adjudication in economic matters, most of the decisions on social issues which Reagan's administration criticized remained untouched (abortion, affirmative action, school prayer) or became liberalized (LGBT rights, death penalty). Furthermore, one of Reagan's candidates to the Supreme Court was rejected by the Senate in a brutal political nomination game (Shipan, Shannon 2003). 

More than three decades later, during the tenure of Donald Trump, the Supreme Court became (again) an arena of political rivalry between conservatives and liberals, which was especially visible during the appointment process of Amy Coney Barrett as an Associate Justice. Paradoxically, it was not Barrett who could mark a significant change to Court's adjudication, but another Trump's appointee, Brett Kavanaugh, who earlier replaced the retired Justice Anthony Kennedy. As a result, the ideological balance on the Court moved to the right, giving the potential to the conservative majority to review and overrule crucial cases concerning social relations in the United States.

The paper aims to analyze the impact of ideology on the Supreme Court appointments made by Donald Trump and possible direction of constitutional interpretation in the coming years. The Author believes, that despite only one tenure, Trump's judicial legacy may have a fundamental effect on the meaning of Bill of Rights, especially with regard to social issues, such as abortion, the right to privacy, same-sex marriage, or procedural rights, thus continuing the conservative revolution initiated in the 1980s by Ronald Reagan. 

By reviewing the popular paradigms of judicialization of politics and politicization of judiciary, the Author is also willing to present a third paradigm of so-called constitutionalization of politics. It is a process of constitutional interpretation conducted by non-judicial institutions which act as if they had power to review and re-write the Constitution using it as a tool to obtain their political goals. Apart from appointing “proper” judges, presidents often interpreted the supreme law of the land in a more conservative or liberal way trying to legitimize their policies. By referring to the famous “legitimate end” theory introduced by John Marshall in McCulloch v. Maryland, the Author plans to present Donald Trump’s actions as clear examples of constitutionalization of politics, both in the process of Supreme Court appointments, as well as in his own approach to the process of constitutional interpretation.",Jagiellonian University,,,,,,,,Jagiellonian University,,Paweł Laidler,,,,,,,,Paweł Laidler,,Constitutions,Democracy,USA,Courts,Domestic Politics,Judicialisation,Policy-Making,POTUS,"Let the end be legitimate: the U.S. Supreme Court, Donald Trump and constitutionalization of politics",https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=66121&EventID=185
0,"The political analysis of the redistributive role of taxes is gaining importance in an unequal world. People are claiming more progressive tax systems, particularly taxing the wealthiest 1% of the population to have more egalitarian fiscal pacts. Although some scholars have insisted on the role of taxes in diminishing inequality through progressive tax systems, different international organisations (IMF, WB, IDB), some academic circles, and policy experts continue promoting neutrality-type of tax reforms to foster the tax system’s efficiency. The latter consider focusing on the expenditure side of fiscal policies to achieve redistribution. Given this normative and theoretical dispute, it is then worth asking whether the current indexes of tax progressivity can reflect the effects of neutral-type tax reforms in the progressivity of tax systems, particularly whether the richest of the population have been paying more taxes than the bottom during the last decades. 

Besides the efforts of some scholars to analyse the vertical equity - the principle that those at the top of the socioeconomic ladder should be taxed more heavily - and the progressivity of the tax systems (see Rubolino and Waldenström (2020) for further references), there is not a systematic approach that allows us to evaluate the evolution of vertical equity and progressivity appeals in tax systems. Inspired by the Palma Ratio index of inequality, I introduce a new concept, “vertical progressivity”, combining the ideas of vertical equity and tax progressivity. The concept of vertical progressivity is measured with a new instrument, the “progressive vertical index”, which concentrates the analysis on the evolution of the average tax rates paid by the wealthiest 1% of each country over a period - with respect to the average tax rates paid by the bottom of the income distribution. The progressive vertical index will show a country’s situation in a specific year, indicating whether the wealthiest 1% have higher or lower effective tax rates than the bottom group. It will also show the trend of a country and allow comparisons between different countries. For testing the index, I work with a novel dataset developed by De Rosa, Flores and Morgan (2021) that contains the average tax rates of each percentile of the population of ten countries of Latin America during the 2000-2019 period, which are calculated following the methodology of Saez and Zucman (2019).

The proposed progressive vertical index is part of my PhD research project, helping to examine further questions: What is the role of political institutions in explaining upward or downward trends in vertical progressivity?

0,"Despite a rich literature on the dynamics and bargaining strategies used during legislative trilogue negotiations in the European Union (EU), little is known about the extent to which the initial positions of EU legislators are defined by domestic politics of the member states. Here, we investigate the conditions which enable national governments represented in the Council of Ministers to shape the overall Council position at the start of trilogue negotiations. We posit that a successful translation of the national preferences over policy outcome is mediated by the degree to which the respective policy area is politicized on the domestic level. Growing salience and contestation characterizing EU politics in the member states enable political actors to defend their stance over policy on the supranational level and steer the overall Council’s position closer to their preferred outcome. Furthermore, we anticipate that such factors as national elections and party polarization serve as additional leverage used by the Council members when framing the negotiating mandate prior to the trilogues. Our results add to the growing literature unpacking the relationship between national political dynamics and behavior of the institutions in the multilayered system of the EU. To test our expectations, we rely on a semi-supervised machine learning scaling of a new political debates dataset to map the positions of the national governments across the Union and to examine the content of the negotiation mandates. We draw on the Eurobarometer indicators to capture the domestic politicization of the EU issues across the societies and policy areas.","Departments of Political Science and Public Administration, Universiteit Leiden",University of Strathclyde,"Departments of Political Science and Public Administration, Universiteit Leiden",University of Strathclyde,"Departments of Political Science and Public Administration, Universiteit Leiden",,,,"Departments of Political Science and Public Administration, Universiteit Leiden",,Anastasia Ershova,Zachary Greene,Aleksandra Khokhlova,Christine Sylvester,Nikoleta Yordanova,,,,Anastasia Ershova,,European Union,Government,Negotiation,Quantitative,Comparative Perspective,,,,Leveraging politicization?

0,"Liberalization, broadly understood as the removal of market barriers, has been a prominent trend in both coordinated and liberal market economies in the last fifty years. The literature has argued that countries implement different types of liberalization with varying distributive outcomes. The extent to which liberalization is associated with inequality is relevant because the distribution of winners and losers affect the political dynamics that explain the trajectories of change of these market economies. However, empirical evidence on the distributional implications between (different types of) liberalization and inequality is still scarce. In this paper, we study the relationship between liberalization and income inequality using a new database on liberalizing reforms in 13 policy fields, covering 37 advanced capitalist democracies between 1974 and 2014. We combine this data with inequality estimates from the Luxembourg Income Study, and use error correction models to estimate the short- and long-run distributional impact of liberalization. Our preliminary findings indicate that liberalizing reforms increase market inequality (measured with the Gini indicator) and bottom-end inequality (measured as the income ratio between the median and bottom decile). However, we also find no statistically significant effects on disposable inequality (Gini) and the 90-10 income ratio, and we even find a negative association between liberalization and top-end inequality (measured as the income ratio between the top decile and the median). Exploring potential mechanisms behind these associations, we find that liberalization significantly reduces social expenditures, weakens union membership, and the coverage of collective bargaining agreements, but it does not significantly affect redistribution. Overall, these findings suggest that liberalization substantially widens market inequalities but does not necessarily hamper governments’ ability to compensate voters whose relative position is endangered by liberalizing reforms.",University of Zurich,Aarhus Universitet,,,,,,,University of Zurich,,Klaus Armingeon,David Weisstanner,,,,,,,Klaus Armingeon,,Comparative Politics,Political Economy,Public Policy,Regulation,Welfare State,Policy Change,,,Liberalization and income inequality: A comparative analysis (1974-2014),https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63544&EventID=185
0,"There is an endless story between the inequality of economic distribution, the emergence and consolidation of democracies, and the waxing and waning of people's demand for them. Most of these explanations are based on the first two of the three leading research approaches in political science: rationality, structure and culture (Lichbach and Zuckerman, 2009). However, this paper aims to bring back cultural factors into the relationship between inequality and democratic support. In this paper, traditional cultural values are disentangled from the dimensions of 'liberty' and 'equality. We assume that people's preferences for 'liberty' and 'equality' will determine their innate preferences for democracies and their perceptions of social justice and redistribution, producing different effects on democratic support when social inequality changes. This paper argues that 'equality' values exacerbate people's distrust of democracies due to unequal economic distribution. In contrast, people's 'liberty' values immunise people against the effects of social inequality on support for democracy. Using the Asian Barometer Survey and the World Values Survey as analytical data, this paper distinguishes traditional cultural values into four different dimensions and finds that anti-liberal cultural values are harmful to democratic support. In contrast, equality-related values are not related to democratic support but were highly influential on people's approval of government redistribution policies. Using multilevel regression analysis, we test the primary hypothesis that a value system that prefers liberty will directly positively impact democratic support. In contrast, values that emphasise equality will hurt democratic support as inequality rises. Through the assumptions and analyses in this paper, we find that culture is still influential. A distinction between dimensions within the culture will help us distinguish between different cultural dimensions of democratic support and perceptions of inequality. On the other hand, the value of equality deserves more attention in this era of democratic de-consolidation. The rise of social inequality at the aggregate level undermines the legitimacy of democracy, whereas the value of liberty in maintaining democratic support. In the meantime, we should still hope that other factors like education can mitigate the elasticity of democratic support caused by the value of equality. Conclusively, it is hoped that more attention to culture will lead to a deeper study of democratic support and provide a diagnosis and prescription to every democracy in the stagnant consolidation.",National Taiwan University,,,,,,,,National Taiwan University,,Osbern Huang,,,,,,,,Osbern Huang,,Democracy,Survey Research,Political Cultures,,,,,,Liberty or equality?

0,"This paper explores the pandemic debates of ‘us vs. them’ in Sweden, drawing on political theory and online ethnography. In 2020, the attention for pandemic policies in Sweden was personified in the chief epidemiologist of the state, who received high levels of respect and affective idealisation (including portraits of him tattooed in the fans’ body parts). Not everyone agreed. The national media picked this up in closed discussion groups on Facebook, where expatriate dissent to Swedish Covid-19 policy was vented. This private group of concerned citizens followed foreign developments and informed the media outside the country of the Swedish events. While national Covid-19 policies were considered a success in Sweden, the death toll was particularly high among the groups with migrant backgrounds. The critics of these policies were labelled enemies of the state. We situate our analysis in the tradition of normative behaviour in Sweden, where claims of democracy and national superiority intertwine as the dominant social imaginary. Our case study unveils the limits of policy critique in a (seemingly) democratic system. It reveals how the government-commissioned opinion polls were called off at crucial times when its popularity was shrinking. Democratic backsliding during the Covid-19 pandemic takes place globally, as the pandemic control is claimed in top-down visions and contested by minority voices. We highlight that liberal democracies come in diverse shapes. Our paper critically examines the regional focus on democratic backsliding, demonstrating how democratic governance and opinion voicing are much more complex in practice than in idealised textbook cases (such as Sweden). This paper demonstrates the fragility and unevenness of democracy in face of diverse social groups and minorities, through the particular case of Sweden.

0,"A key theme in policy process research is to explain policy change, which means alterations to public policy. Current research posits that diverse policy actors come together and devise strategies to exploit windows of opportunity to influence policy change. Yet the literature faces several limitations. Most analyses lack formal hypothesis tests and fail to explicitly connect policy actors’ strategies to policy change; this weakens the explanatory power of causal analysis. Furthermore, past work relies extensively on single case studies that hamper comparative analysis and generalizable knowledge. Focusing on Ghana and Nigeria, this study lessens these limitations by using the Advocacy Coalition Framework (ACF) to develop and tests four policy change hypotheses on advocacy coalitions, negotiated agreement, internal and external perturbations, and policy-oriented learning. The study uses semi-structured interviews to collect data from 86 purposively selected participants. News media data (2007-2020) and scientific reports on oil and gas policy are used to supplement interview data. Using theory-testing process tracing, preliminary results suggests that coalition formation, and internal and external perturbations are necessary conditions for policy change in both countries. These conditions are linked to three key strategies that policy actors used to influence policy change: lobbying, reference to scientific information, and participating in public meetings. The study contributes to the literature by offering rigorous, causal explanations to policy change and advancing comparative analysis.

0,"Populism is among the most popular subjects that are analysed in a comparative perspective by major cross-cultural surveys (such as ISSP) or EU Framework projects (such as DEMOS, FATIGUE or POPREBEL). This paper is based on a work implemented under the H2020 project DEMOS. As part of DEMOS project, Bartha, Boda and Szikra (2021) developed a theoretical framework suggesting the method of congruence analysis (which originally was used by Blatter and Haverland, 2012) to investigate the empirical relevance of the ideal type of populist policy making through three main aspects: policy content, policy process, and policy discourse. In this paper we present results of the study of populist party performance while being part of the Lithuanian Government in public policy, focussing on three domains – macroeconomic, criminal justice and family policy. The study found that policy making and governance in criminal justice may be described as populist content, process, and discourse free. Economic policy of two of the parties analysed (the Labour Party and the Party Order and Justice) may be described as ideologically multifaceted and diverse, while the National Resurrection Party stayed rather consistent ideologically and supported liberal agenda. Area of the family policy was more prone to become populated with populist elements, at least by the Party Order and Justice. It was full of Manichean content, dismissing the “liberal agenda of elites” and destructive “values of the West”.",Kaunas University of Technology,Kaunas University of Technology,Kaunas University of Technology,,,,,,Kaunas University of Technology,,Egle Butkeviciene,Vaidas Morkevičius,Giedrius Zvaliauskas,,,,,,Egle Butkeviciene,,Governance,Populism,Public Policy,,,,,,Lithuanian populist parties in the government and their impact on public policy,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64298&EventID=185
0,"Under what conditions will courts serve as guardians for free and fair elections? Understanding judicial behavior in electoral disputes is crucial as the politicization of courts is at the heart of contemporary autocratization efforts at the same time as courts in backsliding and hybrid regimes increasingly are asked to settle electoral disputes. Yet, while recent scholarship has examined losing candidates' strategic decisions to litigate and the consequences of judicial decisions for public opinion, there is still a dearth of scholarship concerning the politics of how judges adjudicate electoral disputes.  This paper leverages a comprehensive dataset on  electoral disputes in Zambian courts, which are routinely asked to intervene in elections.  We  examine both the political and career considerations that influence electoral justice and how litigation patterns are shaped by anticipation of strategic judicial decision-making. Our preliminary expectations are that judicial review allows political elites to challenge electoral results through legal means, but that judicial decision-making is constrained both by judges' reliance on political actors to enforce their decisions and because individual judges may fear sanctions from powerful political actors. Judges can therefore be expected to be reluctant to invalidate results in constituencies won by the ruling party. Anticipating judicial restraint, opposition parties will also be less likely to challenge such results in court.",Universitetet i Oslo,Universitetet i Oslo,Universitetet i Bergen,,,,,,Universitetet i Oslo,,Øyvind Stiansen,Haakon Gjerløw,Lise Rakner,,,,,,Øyvind Stiansen,,Africa,Elections,Courts,,,,,,Litigating and Adjudicating Electoral Disputes in Hybrid Regimes: Evidence from Zambia,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63351&EventID=185
0,"In recent decades, Sami groups have been involved in numerous disputes on rights to land and natural resources across Sápmi, the region traditionally inhabited by the Sami people in northern Fennoscandia. For instance, in 2020 Girjas Sami village won the right to administer fishing and hunting rights on its lands in the Swedish Supreme Court. In Norway, reindeer owners challenged a wind turbine park on the Fosen peninsula and the Supreme Court of Norway ruled the license for wind power development invalid last October. In Finland, local Sami fishers have challenged the Tana River fishery agreement between Norway and Finland by demonstratively violating the fishing regulations to provoke prosecution. Moreover, Sami groups have filed several complaints with international law bodies to contest e.g. wind farms, mining or logging that interfere with traditional Sami livelihoods. Thus, while Sami groups pioneered litigation tactics already in the 1960s, a broad set of actors are now turning to legal mobilization to settle conflicts on land and natural resources in Sápmi. 
Key previous research on Sami political mobilization has documented the systematic historical injustices perpetrated by the states; analyzed repressive state policies towards the Sami; and described evolving ethnopolitical activism. Furthermore, legal research has explored the regulation of Sami land rights from a doctrinal perspective. Another strand of research investigates how extractive industries impact on Sami livelihoods and resistance.
Yet we lack knowledge about why Sami groups turn to legal action in their struggles for land and recognition, as well as the wider consequences of their legal mobilization. Why do Sami groups increasingly use litigation tactics to pursue their aims? What determines their success? Why are they litigating in some conflicts but not others? What are the benefits and drawbacks of using litigation strategies to pursue redress of grievances, policy change and societal transformation? And more broadly, how do legal disputes over land rights affect social relations within the Sami communities and the societies in which they live?
Taking up this challenge, this paper presents an agenda for socio-legal research on legal mobilization on indigenous land rights in Finland, Norway and Sweden. Using novel empirical data on indigenous land rights litigation in Nordic courts and international human treaty bodies, the paper serves to map out and explain the patterns of legal mobilization on indigenous land rights across the three states. While overall similar in terms of their politico-legal systems, the three states also differ on institutional and structural parameters, such as the demography of the Sami group, international law commitments, indigenous autonomy and consultation orders, land ownership and regulations on reindeer herding. As such institutional frameworks likely set constraints and opportunities for legal mobilization, the paper employs socio-legal mobilization theory to account for patterns of litigation and stake out pathways for future research on legal struggles over indigenous land rights in Sápmi and beyond.",University of Gothenburg,,,,,,,,University of Gothenburg,,Johan Karlsson Schaffer,,,,,,,,Johan Karlsson Schaffer,,Civil Society,Human Rights,Social Movements,Courts,Jurisprudence,Mobilisation,Activism,,"Litigating land rights in Sápmi: Indigenous legal mobilization in Finland, Norway and Sweden",https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64411&EventID=185
0,"Scholarship in transnational law and governance has developed helpful frameworks for analyzing the role of various actors and institutions which transcend or defy the distinction between national and international levels and private or public spheres (K. W. Abbott & Snidal, 2009; Jessup, 1956; Zumbansen, 2011). It has developed in response to the methodological limitations of legal analysis in purely domestic or international contexts, emphasizing the cross-jurisdictional dynamics of legal systems as well as the role of private actors – in addition to states – in formal and informal modes of lawmaking (Calliess & Zumbansen, 2010; Cutler, 2003; Teubner, 2002). However, the field has largely overlooked the role of litigation, focusing instead on new social movements, the political (rather than legal) work of transnational civil society actors, and technical and expertise-led governance actors (Block-Lieb & Halliday, 2017; Halliday & Shaffer, 2015). The world of litigation has been wrongly assumed to be limited to legal analysis within the nation-state framework. Yet, Slaughter’s account of transnational judicial communications and networks, first published nearly 30 years ago, already identified courts, and hence litigation, as a transnational legal process of primary importance. This paper reviews the seminal works of general theory on transnational law and governance, with a particular focus on their accounts of the lawmaking processes and actors, in hopes of identifying why litigation has had such limited attention in their accounts. How do they describe the process of lawmaking in the absence of litigation? What and who are involved in lawmaking processes according to these accounts? And how do they understand the role of conflict in these processes, if litigation is largely excluded? Through reviewing these seminal accounts of transnational lawmaking, this paper identifies problematic lacunae about the position of conflict, and thus conflict resolution vis-à-vis litigation.",Tilburg University,,,,,,,,Tilburg University,,Phillip Paiement,,,,,,,,Phillip Paiement,,Conflict,Social Movements,Courts,Global,Jurisprudence,,,,Litigation and Conflict: Forgotten processes in transnational lawmaking?,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64945&EventID=185

In this paper, we investigate the extent of this phenomenon. Drawing on the literatures on party organizations and political careers, we map the careers trajectories politicians follow before becoming ministers. We delineate three domains: amateur politics, professional politics, and the non-political realm. This allows us to distinguish between ministers who have mostly lived for politics, off politics, or outside of politics. We develop a theoretical framework explaining the prevalence of certain career paths based on the characteristics of political institutions, party systems, and party organisations. To that end, we draw on the most comprehensive data source on political careers to date, comprising several thousand individuals in 30 European democracies between 1945 and 2020. Using unsupervised clustering techniques, we identify career types and contrast them with our theoretical expectations.

0,"Business lobbying or interest group engagement with the political process more broadly is typically conceptualized as covering all three branches of government. Yet the overwhelming bulk of both theoretical and empirical scholarship focusses on the executive and legislative. There is only a small sliver of scholarship - primarily in critical legal studies and some corners of political science that concerns itself with lobbing and influencing the judiciary.  What’s more, this body of scholarship is very fragmented, highly diverse in disciplinary background and geographic focus, often employs a very narrow notion of lobbying and is insufficiently linked into broader discussions in interest group representation and business lobbying.
This paper focusses on business lobbying, or more encompassing corporate political activity (henceforth CPA) to advance five main points. 

First, I will provide empirical evidence that influencing the judiciary is indeed both conceptually under-developed and empirically overlooked in political science, as well as in business studies on CPA. 

In a second step I will discuss several reasons for why this is so; some related to theoretical, other more to practical misconceptions or blind spots.
 
Next, I will argue that this is a rather unfortunate situation. Engaging with the judiciary, not through litigation, but through a variety of standard influencing practices, as well as through some rather idiosyncratic tactics, is a core area for both collective and individual CPA. Corporate political activity directed at the judiciary system is highly complementary to, at times substitutive for, and always deeply intertwined on several different levels with “conventional” conceptions of CPA. Judiciary related CPA is very consequential. It is highly policy relevant in its own right, and very productive for advancing our understanding of corporate influencing more broadly. 
In a fourth step I will sketch the outline of a conceptual framework to help think about and cluster the very different types of CPA that take place around the judiciary. These types range from individual, episodic interventions around specific court cases or litigation exposures to long-term collective investments in shaping the fundamental architecture of the judicial system and make it conducive to specific business interests. The latter in particular with its ambition to architect a structurally advantageous ordering of rights, their interpretation and their adjudication has the potential to outlast and outperform comparable long-game investments in lobbying the executive or legislative branches. To build this framework I draw heavily on journalistic accounts, empirical vignettes from the grey policy literature and on a review of related conceptual and empirical contributions in a variety of fields.  
Finally, I will propose promising avenues for future research on CPA and interest group interventions in the judiciary. This outlook is guided by the potential for advancing scholarly discourse in interest group studies and it is also animated by the policy relevance of CPA in the judicial sphere considering the widespread shortcomings in the existing integrity infrastructures of practical judicial systems in many contexts.",Copenhagen Business School,,,,,,,,Copenhagen Business School,,Dieter Zinnbauer,,,,,,,,Dieter Zinnbauer,,Governance,Interest Groups,Political Economy,Business,Courts,Corruption,Ethics,Lobbying,"Lobbying and influencing the judiciary – surprisingly overlooked, highly consequential and a promising area for future inquiry",https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=62232&EventID=185

Recent scholarship therefore investigates the extent to which domestic, private actors such as firms comply with restrictive measures. Yet, we know strikingly little about how private actors respond to EU policy-making on sanctions prior to their eventual adoption and implementation. Do they lobby EU decision-makers? Are they in contact with their national governments regarding restrictive measures? Do they influence the design of EU sanctions?

0,"In municipalities of Wallonia (Belgium), local climate stakeholders such as renewable energy cooperatives, wind turbine opposition movements and Transition Town Network local sections have emerged in the period between 2008 and 2021. At the same time, local authorities have started to (re)develop the energy competence in order to meet climate targets. This context offers an interesting framework to look at local climate action obstacles through the lens of polycentric governance. This paper is based on a fieldwork in 18 municipalities covered through 59 semi-direct interviews and on a review of local media content. The data analysis has been conducted through the use of qualitative comparative analysis (QCA) methods.

In those municipalities, the slow development of local climate actions is sustained by obstacles such as weak institutional capacity, lack of knowledge/ideas about how to conduct the energy transition, citizen’s distrust towards local public authorities, the importance of daily urgent issues and a lack of money. In this paper, I argue that municipalities that have supported polycentricity are better equipped to face these obstacles. Indeed, local climate stakeholders may speed up local climate actions, enhance energy and social experimentation, increase trust amongst local stakeholders through (non) institutionalized participative mechanisms and reinforce local institutional capacity with both site-specific knowledge and energy expertise. However, in some municipalities, wind turbine opposition movements may reinforce existing local climate obstacles.
Ultimately, this paper sheds light on the role of local authorities and local stakeholders in leading local climate actions. The use of the concept of polycentric governance allows to look at local energy (public) actions from an innovative angle. However, its use throughout this fieldwork allows me to underline its limits, one of them being its weak support to formulate useful operational recommendations for (local) decision makers.",Université Saint-Louis - Bruxelles,,,,,,,,Université Saint-Louis - Bruxelles,,Loïc Cobut,,,,,,,,Loïc Cobut,,Governance,Institutions,Local Government,Qualitative Comparative Analysis,Energy Policy,,,,Local climate action obstacles and support for polycentric governance in Municipalities from Wallonia.,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63630&EventID=185
0,"The last few decades local councillors are increasingly challenged. On the one hand, by the executive that became more professionalised and dominant. On the other hand, by the implementation of participatory practices. This paper will explore the impact of the participatory forms of democracy on local councillors. Local democracy evolved from a primarily representative to a more hybrid form due to the introduction of participatory arrangements. This creates tension regarding the position and role of local councillors who are believed to be key actors in the classic representative democracy, whilst participatory democracy is on the rise. Citizen participation changes the nature of local democracy and especially the functioning of local elected representatives. Thus, it is crucial to shed light on the attitudes of local councillors towards this new hybrid form of democracy. Existing theoretical reflections and empirical research have already explored this in general. Our contribution deepens this line by considering various types of arrangements and probing into specific dimensions of councillors’ position and role. 
This paper will investigate the impact of the design of participatory initiatives on local councillors’ attitudes by conducting a large-scale vignette-survey on councillors in Flanders (Belgium). More in particular, we will measure the effect of both the initiator of the participatory arrangement (government or citizen) and the extent to which power is transferred to citizens (consultative, coproductive or decisive) on local councillors’ legitimacy perceptions. In addition, this study investigates whether representational role types (e.g. Trustee, Voter’s Delegate and Party’s Delegate) have a moderating impact on the effect of the participatory design on local councillors’ political attitudes.",Ghent University,Ghent University,Ghent University,Ghent University,,,,,Ghent University,,Nina De Smedt,Tessa Haesevoets,Kristof Steyvers,Bram Wauters,,,,,Nina De Smedt,,Democracy,Democratisation,Elites,Governance,Local Government,Political Participation,Public Policy,Decision Making,LOCAL COUNCILLORS UNDER PARTICIPATORY PRESSURE?

0,"Local elections are often treated as second-order, subordinate to the national electoral arena in a similar manner as the elections of the European Parliament are. The original second-order election (SOE) model expects incumbent national parties to perform worse while smaller and extreme parties perform better in SOE. Yet, the original model ignores the significance of arena-specific incumbency. While it is difficult to clearly identify the government-opposition divide in the European arena, this distinction matters in local politics. Based on the literature on “dual accountability” and the original fine-grained dataset combining the results of local and national elections in 98 Danish municipalities since 2007, we argue that the arena-specific considerations play an indispensable role in explaining parties’ gains and losses in elections held at the local level. Our analyses conducted in a country with extremely highly nationalized local politics, where party affiliations provide a clear linkage between arenas, document a substantial bonus for local incumbent parties.

0,"Local integration policy is a growing field of research in Europe, especially after the so-called 2015 ‘refugee crisis’. While local governments are increasingly involved in integration policymaking, a growing number of actors is involved in local integration governance (Schiller 2019). Scholars have argued that patterns of interaction between actors within local ‘policy networks’ are key to explain local official decisions, practices, prevailing frames (e.g. Pastore and Ponzo, 2019). Moving from these premises, this paper addresses the following questions: what are the factors that influence key features of local integration policy networks and coalitions therein? And how did the pandemic affect interactions within these networks? To answer these questions, we develop a social network analysis elaborating data collected in the framework of the H2020 Whole-COMM project about actors’ interactions within local integration policy networks in 49 localities (across 10 countries). These localities are characterised by different socio-economic situations and demographic trends, different previous experience with immigration, institutional frameworks and have local governments of different political affiliations.

Nevertheless, according to intersectional theory, the combination of these seemingly marginal political identities can become an advantage for immigrant-origin women. The reason for this is the adoption of gender quotas by most immigrant-receiving countries as well as the evidence that, despite this, political parties still face difficulties in attracting autochthonous women. Therefore, the inclusion of female candidates of immigrant origin can help party leaders to achieve two objectives. Firstly, it allows them to increase minority political representation. At the same time, it provides them the opportunity to enhance the female quota. Hence, selecting immigrant-origin women is an efficient strategy for party elites, a way of ‘killing two birds with one stone’. However, to date, insufficient attention has been paid both to party characteristics and local leader’s attitudes that can determine the success or failure of this strategy. Based on 44 in-depth interviews carried out with local leaders and immigrant-origin candidates (both men and women), our paper focuses on local elections in Spain to address several questions: Does party ideology interfere in any way in this strategy? Why some parties are more capable than others in recruiting immigrant-origin women? When it comes to distinguish among different women minority groups, which groups do party leaders favor the most? Our results indicate that the strategy of ‘killing two birds with one stone’ is shared by all parties, regardless their ideology. However, traditional parties would have been particularly successful in implementing it, because of their deeper contact with local immigrant community networks. Finally, our analysis suggests that party leaders are more willing to include women from UE14 and Latin America countries, than those of Romanian and Moroccan origins.",Universidad Autònoma de Madrid – Instituto de Políticas y Bienes Públicos del CSIC,Universidad Autònoma de Madrid – Instituto de Políticas y Bienes Públicos del CSIC,,,,,,,Universidad Autònoma de Madrid – Instituto de Políticas y Bienes Públicos del CSIC,,María Soledad Escobar,Santiago Pérez-Nievas,,,,,,,María Soledad Escobar,,Elites,Gender,Political Participation,Representation,Immigration,Party Members,Public Opinion,,Local leaders’ attitudes towards the political representation of Immigrant-origin women: evidence from Spain,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65307&EventID=185
0,"Based on preliminary findings from the ongoing “Whole-COMM” project (H2020), this paper aims to better understand some of the concrete challenges and opportunities that the arrival and settlement of post-2014 migrants pose for small and medium sized towns across the EU. It draws on semi-structured interviews with public, private, and civil society actors, which were conducted between September 2021 and February 2022 in a total of 40 municipalities across seven EU-Member states. Our analysis primarily focusses on migrants’ access to adequate housing and employment in these localities, as two key resources in relation to both fundamental rights protection and “sustainable integration”. The findings indicate that access depends not only on structural conditions (e.g., supply and demand in local labour and housing markets) but is being mediated by a diverse range of local actors with different interests, resources, and power positions. Integration and social cohesion do not necessarily represent the only/overall rationale guiding their various efforts, and the interplay between them can also lead to exclusion and inequality. This interplay and the resulting measures can thus be analysed in terms of what Collyer, Hinger and Schweitzer (2020) call the ‘politics of (dis)integration’. Looking at how the same types of actors (try to) foster but sometimes also hinder post-2014 migrants´ access to adequate housing and employment in different local and national contexts, will help us to better understand these local politics of (dis)integration from a comparative perspective.",University of Sussex,,,,,,,,University of Sussex,,Reinhard Schweitzer,,,,,,,,Reinhard Schweitzer,,Civil Society,Governance,Integration,Local Government,Migration,Immigration,Comparative Perspective,Refugee,"Local politics of (dis)integration.

0,"Strong leaders are assumed to benefit their political parties. They set out the party’s vison and ideology, perhaps with a new distinctive policy. They reinvigorate the organisation, often by taking personal control, and using their own ideology and personality to reach beyond a party’s traditional base. They can use that organisation to fashion an electoral strategy that creates a new coalition of support. The strong leader becomes the focus of the party’s electoral strategy and the face through which the organisation sells itself.
But there is evidence that strong leaders actually leave their parties in worse shape than they found them, and that parties may be better off in the medium to long term without the initial bounce the leader gives. It is not clear why this is the case. The leader might ‘damage’ the party by deinstitutionalising the organisation, over-promising in elections, or taking the party in a too radical policy direction. They might suppress debate, postponing necessary conflict until after their departure. 
This paper takes three distinct types of ‘strong leaders’ studies how each changed their parties and how this had an impact on the party long after the leader departed. The three leaders, Thatcher, Papandreou, and Haughey are different, one an ideologue, one a populist and one a transactional ‘player’.

0,"Recent work on political representation has effectively transformed our understanding of political representation. The conception of representation as a relationship between actors formulating representative claims and audiences engaging with such claims highlights the constitutive and dialectical qualities of political representation. However, discussions on representation need to focus more on the ways in which audiences assist in processes of political representation. In support of this argument, the paper analyses a concrete political performance that was delivered before two different audiences: (1) the live audience of a press conference organized by the Flemish liberal party following its electoral defeat in May 2019 and (2) the online audience that manifested itself after the video recording of the original performance was uploaded on the party’s Facebook platform. 
The comparison of both events reveals how the assistance of the audience shapes the actual performance and determines its felicitous outcome (cf. Austin 1962). Facebook’s architecture allows the audience to formulate comments and express (dis)like. This capacity for critically reading back (cf. Saward 2020) the representative claims articulated in the live performance turns the online audience into co-producers, whose contributions radically alter the original meaning of the performance and degrade it to a self-congratulatory performance by ‘out-of-touch’ political elites.
Focusing on the audience helps us to: link spectatorship (e.g., Green 2010; Fitzgerald 2015) with political representation, grasp the ways in which practices of watching, listening and commenting may shape and/or improve democratic politics (Rosanvallon 2011; Coleman 2005), take seriously the role of audiences in systemic representation, and underline the co-constituted character of political representation.",Vrije Universiteit Brussel,,,,,,,,Vrije Universiteit Brussel,,Eline Severs,,,,,,,,Eline Severs,,Democracy,Elites,Political Theory,Representation,Qualitative,Communication,,,Look who’s watching.

In this paper, we ask: How is developing countries' participation in multilateral negotiations affected by going virtual? While the reduced travel and participation costs associated with virtual negotiations could increase participation, alternate factors such as the quality of technological infrastructure and lack of dedicated time to negotiate might lead to reduced developing country participation in negotiations. To examine how participation is affected by a virtual shift, we use data from the negotiations of investor-state dispute settlement reform at the United Nations. In our analysis, we leverage a difference-in-differences design to understand changes in the frequency and extent of developing country participation before and after negotiations were made virtual. We then carry out a qualitative content analysis of negotiation transcripts to investigate changes in the content and form of developing country participation. This allows us to probe the mechanisms underpinning increased or decreased participation. We situate our research in the literatures on negotiation power in global governance, development studies on the domestic and international capacity of states, and the role of small states in international relations.

0,"The paper focuses on explaining low relevance local state-society networks in CEE region, especially turning the attention to the role of civic actors in local politics. CEE region is characterized by newly build democratic governance system that was facing many legal, institutional and organizational challenges. First, the institutions were generally weak, and some countries even lacked the bureaucratic capacity and managerial skills. Second, the prospect of establishing a well-functioning local-state relationship seemed to be gloom as the CEE countries lack solid civic participation and institutional trust (Howard 2002). The characteristics of the CEE region are that the systems of local state-society relations are identified as local elitists (Sellers and Kwak 2011: 626), where the civil society remains less organized and less broadly mobilized through the network of civic organizations. Our paper presents the survey results of general dataset from our survey on ""Local state-society relations"" performed in 20 European countries in 2021. For our analytical purposes we use data from CEE region countries (Czech Republic, Croatia, Lithuania, Latvia and Poland) that allows us to measure and explain the level of relevance in specific policy fields and the role of different actors in the networks. The statistical analysis results indicate that as the most skeptical to the relevance of the networks are the societal (civic) actors, in sharp contrast to all other European countries, Although the CEE regions rather lack consociational or corporatist forms of governance on the local level (Sellers et al., 2020), the results also suggest huge differences across particular networks due to their political field and agenda (Heinelt et al., 2021).",Vytautas Magnus University,,,,,,,,Vytautas Magnus University,,Jurga Bucaite Vilke,,,,,,,,Jurga Bucaite Vilke,,Civil Society,Local Government,Political Participation,Political Engagement,,,,,Low relevance local state-society networks and challenge of civic actors in CEE region,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65404&EventID=185
0,"This article investigates how authoritarian regimes select ruling elites, focusing on the case of government cabinet members in Morocco, an authoritarian monarchy. Drawing on data collected on the biographical characteristics and political careers of cabinet members between 1956 and 2016, I argue that non-parliamentary monarchies are less subject to the dilemma that arises in authoritarian contexts when appointing ministers between political competence and loyalty to the regime. The results indicate that elites with political competence are appointed to technical ministries, while ministers loyal to the monarchy are given cross-cutting ministerial portfolios to monitor the activities of non-loyal ministers. However, this portfolio design is only effective when the regime is politically stable and not threatened by rebellion.  On the contrary, when the regime is contested, either internally or externally, ministers with political competence, such as party leaders, tend to take precedence over government members with ties to the royal family. This result suggests a strategic use of government design by the monarchy to enhance its survival and avoid betrayal by its government members.  This article expands the literature on the loyalty-competence trade-off, which has focused primarily on non-monarchical authoritarian regimes with indeterminate rules of succession that may favor loyal ministers as a precautionary measure.",Institut d'Études Politiques de Bordeaux,,,,,,,,Institut d'Études Politiques de Bordeaux,,Ahmed Fouad EL HADDAD,,,,,,,,Ahmed Fouad EL HADDAD,,Elites,Executives,Government,Political Leadership,Competence,,,,Loyalty or competence?

Gábor Kutasi, Univesity of Public Service, kutasi.gabor@uni-nke.hu
The outstanding growth and the sudden stop of the Baltic economies in the 2000s arose the assumption that their textbook-like, disciplined economic policy had actually an expansionary and overheating impact on economic growth. A reinterpreted theory of political economy was assigned to this phenomenon. It is called macroeconomic populism. 
The region has seemed to be very disciplined in fiscal and monetary sense since they became independent. In the first half of 2000s they even produced a boosting economic growth and significant real convergence to the higher developed EU members. The region has proved to be attractive for capital investment. However, economic analyses have projected some structural problems in their external (im)balance. These countries with balanced policies suffered sudden stop in 2007, what was even strengthened by the global crisis. If fiscal balance, debt sustainability and fixed exchange rate is secured, what else can undermine the growth potential? Behind the fine indicators considered to be important, the external imbalance of the Baltics showed increasing deficit year by year. Finally, the external indebtedness problem undermined the sustainable growth. 
The study behind the presentation tests the link between the current account imbalance and the real effective exchange rate. The methodology is an OLS regression analysis on current account balance including real effective exchange rate based on both HICP and unit labor cost. The hypothesis is that the real effective exchange rate has significant impact on the current account balance. The results are significant and excluding autocorrelation. If the results are placed in the Baltic economic context, it can be concluded that the macroeconomic populism can be detected in the Baltic region. The presentation overviewt he 2000s and the 2010s economic policy actions.

0,"Over the past few years, many governments, local and national, have reached for deliberative mini-publics (e.g. climate assemblies) in a bid to gain insights into what an informed public would prioritise and countenance in terms of responses to the climate emergency. Yet climate assemblies are time consuming, requiring much planning, organisation, running time, and a complex array of expertise. When embedded in bureaucratic procedures, they can be protracted affairs. The speed with which changes are required may weigh against arguments for the use of deliberative mini publics, yet the gravity of the situation means that the actions taken need to have sufficient impact, which entails ensuring key stakeholders and relevant communities are brought along in the process, whilst also balancing other priorities. This paper considers what contribution deliberative mini-publics can make in addressing climate governance and policy formulation at local government level, using evidence from the Devon Climate Assembly.  The research findings are the outcome of a multi-stakeholder, mixed method evaluation, comprising interview and survey data which includes the perspectives of assembly commissioners, participants, facilitators and other local stakeholders from public, private and civil society sectors. Far from creating knee-jerk policy, the case study suggests that climate assemblies provide an opportunity to develop carefully considered policy with a social mandate, after local citizens have grappled with difficult choices and considered the trade-offs involved. Yet the value of these processes is constrained by critical issues such as the extent to which local policy makers have sufficient influence over wider issues, the coordination of other local planning processes at different tiers of governance, the inclusion of voices from all sectors, balancing the need for sufficient time with local demands for action, and the scope of topics selected for discussion.",University of Exeter,University of Exeter,,,,,,,University of Exeter,,Patrick Devine-Wright,Alice Moseley,,,,,,,Patrick Devine-Wright,,Democracy,Environmental Policy,Local Government,Political Participation,Climate Change,Political Engagement,Policy-Making,,Making deliberative mini-publics count during a climate emergency: Lessons from the Devon Climate Assembly,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64013&EventID=185
0,"A growing body of research documents that women face obstacles in the advancement to positions of influence in politics (e.g. Folke and Rickne 2016; O'Brien 2015). At the same time, we know significantly less about gender differences in the public bureaucracy. While some have observed that women account for a smaller proportion of higher compared to lower bureaucratic positions (Ernst & Young 2014, Nasser 2018), we have little knowledge of why this patter exists. My paper overcomes this lack of knowledge by studying whether the gender of bureaucrats impacts their promotion chances to leadership positions in the public bureaucracy. It thereby advances our knowledge of how well the formal principle of meritocratic recruitment function in practice. 

Unlike politics, public administration is not a male-dominated sector. In recent data for 139 countries, the global average of women’s participation in public administration stands at 46 percent, and in Europe and North America, the average proportion has passed the 50-50 mark (UNDP 2021).  To understand promotion patterns in this context, I apply theories and methods from the literature on gender and promotions in labor markets. In this literature, the concept of a glass escalator symbolizes how an invisible force aids men’s transitions to higher echelons of power in female-dominated organizations. The metaphor originates from extensive qualitative work by Williams (1989, 1992, 1993, 1995) which shows that underrepresented men can gain career advantages through preferential treatment by superiors, coworkers and clients which can “elevate” them to higher positions.

I undertake my analysis in detailed administrative data for local government bureaucracies in Sweden, a dataset that covers the full universe of Swedish local government bureaucrats in 290 municipalities between 2008 and 2019. This data allows a dynamic analysis of promotions across bureaucratic levels over time. The main analysis compares the likelihood of upward promotion for men relative to their women colleagues with equal qualifications. A particular strength of the data is the availability of high-quality variables that measure qualifications for bureaucratic jobs. These variables include education level, educational type, high school grades and labor market experience since 1990. My results show that men face an advantage relative to equally qualified women while climbing in the bureaucratic hierarchy, a pattern that is consistent with the phenomena of a “glass escalator”.

The paper contributes to our understanding of meritocracy and gender equality in the personnel politics of the public sector. This is important not least because the public bureaucracy has the potential to set an example for other labor market sectors in terms of career equality (UNDP 2021). The study also contributes in identifying potential sources of inefficiencies in the public sector. For example, previous research show that women in top bureaucratic positions may improve gender equality in appointments for lower-level positions (Meier and Funk 2017), increase the participation in work-life balance programs (Bae et al. 2019), and improve job satisfaction (D’Agostino 2015).",Uppsala Universitet,,,,,,,,Uppsala Universitet,,Nora Anter,,,,,,,,Nora Anter,,Gender,Local Government,Public Administration,,,,,,Man up!

0,"Ever since the Maastricht Treaty of 1992, preserving peace has been a stated foreign policy objective of the European Union (EU). The 2016 EU’s Global Strategy further promised a comprehensive and multi-dimensional EU approach to conflict prevention, management and resolution, emphasising the importance of preserving peace in the neighbouring regions. However, despite this policy promise, the EU’s actual engagement in conflict prevention and resolution processes in the neighbourhood has been critically assessed by observers. Moreover, the EU has not managed to prevent the emergence of de facto states as the result of secessionist conflicts in its immediate proximity. In many cases, the status of these entities remains unresolved to date. In this paper, we argue that this is not surprising, because – despite its own claims to promote conflict resolution – the EU has actually prioritised a policy of stabilising the conflict situations. To develop this argument, we reattend the concept of normalization, conceived as a policy aim of the EU in its efforts to manage secessionist conflicts. Hereby, conflict parties are expected to move towards a peaceful co-existence and increased interactions. This process would reduce the likelihood of conflict reescalation and hence make it more manageable. Yet, it would not necessarily resolve the underlying incompatibilities between the conflict parties (e.g., the status issue of the secessionist entity). In a comparative study of Kosovo and Transnistria, we demonstrate how the EU engages with the two de facto states to promote normalization of their relations with their parent states in different domains: political, economic, and societal. In doing so – we argue – the EU contributes to stabilizing the status quo, that is the frozen state of the conflicts.",University of Vienna,Justus-Liebig-University Giessen,Universität Hamburg,,,,,,University of Vienna,,Vera Axyonova,Andrea Gawrich,Argyro Kartsonaki,,,,,,Vera Axyonova,,Conflict,Conflict Resolution,European Union,Security,,,,,Managing Secession: The European Union’s Normalisation Approach to Kosovo and Transnistria,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63972&EventID=185
0,"Migration is one of the politically highly sensitive policy fields. This makes it interesting to study in terms of COVID-19 policy response. The chapter focuses on the political context of the COVID-19 related migration policies and measures of the two national governments in Estonia: the conservative leaning cabinet of Jüri Ratas 2019-21 and the liberal leaning cabinet of Kaja Kallas since January 2021.

Crises can function as catalysts for policy change, but whether change occurs depends on multiple factors such as the actual content of the event, the agenda-setting power of the advocates of change, their abilities to foster advocacy coalitions and break up policy monopolies. I study the COVID-19 policies of the cabinets and the political context. I focus on the possibilities of this crisis to induce permanent migration policy changes and relate it to the difficulties of the European Union and member states’ model of technocratic policy making and governance in the recent decades, amplified by the financial crisis, migration crisis and COVID-crisis, but also the the disaffection of a wide range of citizens and the rise of various populist forces influencing also mainstream politics.

The paper starts with the theoretical discussion where the concept of politics of migration policy will be elaborated and operationalized for this study. Then the empirical approach will be developed and the Estonian case contextualized and studied, developing the basis for the subsequent discussion and conclusions. I will also discuss the practical opportunities for developing a more supportive political context for migration policies while also observing the opportunities to develop these to better fit to their contexts",Tallinn University,,,,,,,,Tallinn University,,Leif Kalev,,,,,,,,Leif Kalev,,Governance,Migration,Public Policy,Immigration,Qualitative,Policy Change,,,Managing the COVID-19 crisis and the politics of migration policy in Estonia,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64493&EventID=185
0,"Sociotechnical systems often have nonlinear dynamics such as tipping points which need to be considered. Tipping points are critical thresholds within a system since these points shift the system suddenly from one stable state to another. The tipping point can trigger an improved  or a deteriorated situation. Negative tipping points in the energy transition can be the failure to reduce CO2 emissions sufficiently, thus triggering climate change dynamics or more on a local level a deterioration of air quality. Thus, a successful reduction of CO2 emissions that results in an avoidance of climate change dynamics or improved air quality is an example for a positive tipping point. For a long time the narrative surrounding the energy transition was focused on avoiding a catastrophe, which is slowly changing by shifting the focus onto co-benefits of the energy transition.
To test whether this shift in the narrative might increase support for the energy transition we perform a threshold  public good game in which a threshold has to be reached before cooperation pays off. In particular, we are interested in whether we can see framing effects when presenting the game as a public good (positive tipping points) or a public bad  (negative tipping points) game. Previous research has shown that contributions are higher if people aim to achieve something positive ('Warm Glow' of doing something good). Given that the optimal contribution strategy in threshold games depends on the contributions of the partners, we also elicit beliefs about the partners contributions. Lastly, we run an ultimatum game to elicit social norms on what constitutes ""fair contributions"" which allows us to disentangle the individual contributions towards the energy transition from conditional contribution patterns based on beliefs and social norms.",Institute for Advanced Sustainability Studies (IASS),,,,,,,,Institute for Advanced Sustainability Studies (IASS),,Esther Schuch,,,,,,,,Esther Schuch,,Asia,Climate Change,Decision Making,Experimental Design,Empirical,Energy,,,"Managing tipping point dynamics - Disentangling 'Warm Glow', Beliefs, and Social Norms",https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63530&EventID=185

---------------------
The UN Agenda 2030 and its associated sustainable development goals (SDGs) put an emphasis on the role of cities for achieving a sustainable future for all. Implementing the SDGs in cities is a complex governance challenge, touching on issues ranging from gender equality over biodiversity to climate protection. This means that implementing the SDGs requires cross-scale governance involving solutions in many policy areas and all societal sectors.

Actor networks play a key role for successful cross-scale governance in complex sustainability governance settings. These networks, also called governance networks, consist of organizations from all societal sectors, including civil society, the private sector, government and scientific institutions. In urban contexts, the need to consider actor networks is especially pronounced given the extraordinary diversity and density of actors encountered in urban governance arenas.

For research on urban sustainability governance networks to be useful in supporting actor networks for effective cross-scale governance, it needs to find ways to reliably map and understand these networks. Empirically mapping rapidly evolving governance networks in urban sustainability governance is a complex task. Still, a new research frontier, using the possibilities of data sources and tools arising from digitalization, is increasingly offering ways to handle this complexity and to map governance networks through the use of natural language processing, enabling automated text analysis. In this paper, I introduce the foundations for a data processing pipeline mapping actor networks involved in urban sustainability governance using media data. 

The processing pipeline uses supervised machine learning to first categorize text at the paragraph level, assigning paragraphs to SDG implementation areas (such as mobility). In a second step, we train a named entity recognition classifier to identify organizational actors occurring in these paragraphs and then build on a recently proposed model to extract narratives from large text corpora to categorize actor activity at the sentence level. In a third step, we then use unsupervised text classification to identify governance issues in the implementation area (such as district level implementation of bike infrastructure) in a bottom-up approach by grouping bundles of related actor activity. The final output is a time-stamped bipartite actor-issue graph relating actors to governance issues and through its projection also relating actors and issues to each other.

I demonstrate the processing pipeline and its use in mapping urban sustainability governance networks by applying it to a dataset of news articles from the city Zurich containing 104’000 paragraphs from media articles between 2010 and 2021 occurring in the local (Zurich) section of two national-level, Zurich based newspapers.",University of Zurich,,,,,,,,University of Zurich,,Mario Angst,,,,,,,,Mario Angst,,Environmental Policy,Governance,Quantitative,Policy Implementation,Big Data,Empirical,Policy-Making,,Mapping actor and issue networks in urban sustainability over time using automated content analysis of media data,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63174&EventID=185

Discourses take different perspectives, and only in-depth analytical approaches can grasp the essential content of such discourses. This article introduces one of such approaches, the hierarchical clustering on principal component (HCPC), a straightforward technique to map typologies of discourses considering surveys’ data. HCPC presents at least three important benefits in discourses’ mapping. First, it allows significantly different responses to being isolated, which can be employed to identify the peculiarities of each discourse. Second, it systematically anchors typologies of discourses to survey participants which ultimately allows for exploring the perspective of each participant who represents different stances of a specific issue. Third, it is particularly flexible towards subgroups of questions that refer to the same dimension construct and data type as it can be employed considering either nominal, ordinal or continuous dataset. HCPC technique is presented here considering an empirical example based on a deliberative mini public experiment on climate change policy, an assembly of randomly selected participants which employ a talk-centric mode of deliberation and decision-making.

0,"A complex set of social demands energy systems have to address today led many to consider the state as a stakeholder of public interest, rather than just a rule setter and legal force in competitive energy markets (Goldthau, 2012). Various efforts to steer society towards a lower carbon future have been examined recently, asking whether we leave somebody behind, who is left behind, and what we can do to come up with more accountable solutions in terms of greater access to clean and affordable energy (Primc et al., 2021). Besides other issues, energy poverty and energy vulnerability have been gaining importance as issues deserving continuous attention. Albeit still “hard to grasp for policy-makers” (Dubois, 2021) due to its multidimensional, cross-sectional, and overall dynamic character, recent development indicates growing effort inside the EU and on the level of some of its member states to tackle the issue. The recent development is important. Firstly, non-recognition of energy poverty/vulnerability can lead to non-existent or less effective alleviation policies, “thereby helping structure and reproduce geographical distributive inequalities” (Bouzarovski & Simcock, 2017). Secondly, it is well documented, that triggers of energy poverty/vulnerability can be manifold, including those stemming from the structural level (Koďousková et al., forthcoming). Specific attention has been given to central-heating-energy-poverty linkage as households are often trapped in unsatisfactory conditions with limited possibility for change (Buzar, 2007; Tirado Herrero & Ürge-Vorsatz, 2012; Poputoaia & Bouzarovski, 2010).
Our contribution fits into the ideas mentioned above. The intended transformation of the central heating system in the Czech Republic led to debates about its social impacts. At the same time, it has become clear how little we know about energy poverty and energy vulnerability in the country, which proved to be rather unprepared for rising energy prices and unprecedented bankruptcy of major energy providers. In our contribution, we start with shedding light on how “energy vulnerability” is usually understood in the Czech debate and what are the pitfalls of such an understanding. Next, we demonstrate how we work with the concept concerning the intended DH transformation. In line with a mainstream academic understanding of energy vulnerability and inspired by several studies from abroad, we build an “energy vulnerability index” modified to mirror the Czech context. With the help of fuzzy cluster analysis, we create a map of the most vulnerable places to better understand energy vulnerability´s socio-spatial occurrence. We discuss the strong points and limits of the macro-level analysis and combine its results with preliminary findings gained at the local level (case studies). We conclude with a broader reflection of a combined macro/micro level analysis usefulness to “assist energy planners in making more informed energy choices” (Sovacool & Dworkin, 2015).",Masaryk University,Masaryk University,Masaryk University,Masaryk University,,,,,Masaryk University,,Adriana Ilavská,Hedvika Koďousková,Jan Osička,Tereza Stasakova,,,,,Hedvika Koďousková,,Public Policy,Qualitative,Quantitative,Energy Policy,,,,,Mapping energy vulnerability in the Czech Republic: combined perspectives,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63744&EventID=185

Therefore, we do not know much about the ways that people mobilize and negotiate health crises such as the global pandemic of Covid-19 in Twitter communities. Are users’ networks and discursive activism in health crises similar to their practices during political incidents? Do Twitter users focus on political demands or  prefer to discuss the health and humanitarian issues in crises? Do they challenge the hegemonic discourses in non-democratic societies while they are discussing the pandemic? if yes how?
Health crises have political dimensions and implications. Nonetheless, they are different from political happenings in origin, nature and essence to a great extent. Thus, this research could extend our understanding of social media activism in authoritarian regimes by focusing on an understudied context, i.e. Iran, during a merely different incident, Covid-19 pandemic. 
Drawing upon the literature into social media activism, this investigation focuses on a dataset of 4,165,177 Persian tweets having been collected during the first months of Cov-19 crisis, form 21 January, 2020 to 29 April, 2020. First, we will use Social Network Analysis to detect different communities in Persian Twitter. Then, we will identify the most influential users in each community based on their PageRank centrality (Easley & Kleinberg, 2010). Next, we will extract the list of top 50 users in each community. In the next step, we will extract all of the top users’ tweets. Following KhosraviNik (2017) approach to Social Media Critical Discourse Studies (SM-CDS), we will then discursively and thematically code the tweets to identify 1) which political group each cluster was close to, 2) the salient themes and grounded frames in each cluster, 3) the extent to which these themes supported/challenged the dominant discourses in Iran. The number of coded tweets will be chosen based on the saturation principle. 
This paper will shed more light on the process and nuances of social media activism in authoritarian regimes, beyond political upheavals. To date, we collected the data and conducted the community detection. The next steps, including human-driven discursive coding, will be finished in late June. Then, we will finalize the paper and write the findings and discussion section, in which the findings will be compared to the exsiting literature into social media activism in non-democratic countries. As a result, the whole work, with final and concrete results, will be ready by  August 1st. It will comply with the timeline of the conference.",University of Vienna,,,,,,,,University of Vienna,,Hossein Kermani,,,,,,,,Hossein Kermani,,Democracy,Social Movements,Social Media,Communication,Mixed Methods,Activism,,,Mapping Iranian Twittersphere during the pandemic; an analysis of networks and frames of Covid-19 in authoritarian countries,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64437&EventID=185
0,"The position of independent EU agencies in the European administrative space is constantly changing. In the last decade, the EU responded to policy crises and implementation problems by creating more independent EU agencies with more competences. Recent examples for this are the creation of the ESAs to respond to the financial crisis and expanding Frontex’s tasks and resources as a reaction to the migration crisis. Moreover, European legislators replaced the founding regulation of more than half of all EU agencies to combat the often criticised disparate and idiosyncratic nature of EU agencies during the Juncker Commission. These institutional harmonization reforms influence EU agencies’ capacities but also their formal independence from other EU institutions to different degrees. Formal independence reflects legislators’ willingness to forgo influence and is an important yardstick for agencies’ de facto independence and decision-making behaviour. Thus, our paper raises the question how EU agencies’ independence as their raison d’être develops over time and why some EU agencies become more independent than others. Though some research exists on the formal independence of EU agencies, this research mostly focusses on single agencies or compares only some selected agencies. What is missing, is a systematic mapping of EU agencies’ independence in a cross-sectional as well as a longitudinal manner. 
To provide such a mapping, we compile a novel dataset that measures the formal independence of each EU agency. It covers the entire EU agencies’ landscape – with some of the most powerful agencies only created in recent years. However, it also tracks the development of formal independence over time through including amendments and regulatory overhauls. 
In addition to this mapping, we tentatively explore some potential explanations for variance in agencies’ independence. To do so, we employ both systemic and agency-level hypotheses. For instance, isomorphism or the rational learning of political principals might propel the formal independence of all EU agencies towards a more uniform governance model. On the other hand, agency-level factors such as an agency’s competences or its regulated sector might be more influential in forging its formal independence over time, creating distinct governance models. Thereby, we unravel the drivers of stability and change in EU agencies’ formal independence. This mapping of formal independence in the European administrative space, moreover, allows us to both update our explanations of competence delegations to EU agencies and create insights in the interaction of the formal politics of institutional choice and functional pressures in the post-delegation phase.",Osnabrück University,Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München – LMU,Osnabrück University,Universität Bremen,,,,,Osnabrück University,,Eva Ruffing,Berthold Rittberger,Martin Weinrich,Arndt Wonka,,,,,Eva Ruffing,,Public Administration,Comparative Perspective,Decision Making,,,,,,Mapping the European administrative space  EU Agencies‘ Formal Independence over Time,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65743&EventID=185

Countering maritime piracy off the coast of Somalia was a rather successful process that involved various actors from the United Nations to individual states and organizations. In the case of piracy off the coast of Somalia, existing international agreements gave only partial solutions to the problem. At the core of the international response was perhaps a more minilateral than multilateral process, in which an ad hoc body to counter-piracy was established to provide a forum for decision-making and transfer of information. Based on qualitative analysis of parliamentary discourse in selected national parliaments, this presentation will explore viewpoints presented at the national legislative level.

0,"Much ink has been spilled to describe various tools of autocratic survival, but targeting opposition actors with austerity measures in electoral autocracies is hitherto understudied. This paper argues that the COVID-19 pandemic has provided a rare opportunity for Hungary's Fidesz to disarm opposition parties via cutting off resources of municipalities led by opposition mayors and eliminating any remnants of local governments' fiscal autonomy. Following the 2019 local elections, an ideologically heterogenous coalition of opposition parties succeeded in defeating incumbent Fidesz politicians in urban areas, uniting a fragmented partisan landscape and threatening the government’s reelection in 2022. Opposition mayors campaigned on a platform pledging to introduce democratic innovations, such as participatory budgeting, to invest into healthcare and increase transparency. Whereas Hungary otherwise exhibits one of the lowest levels of local autonomy in Europe, the combination of the opposition breakthrough at the 2019 local elections and COVID-19 created a critical juncture. After a decade, sub-national politics was suddenly characterized by real partisan variance, opposition mayors rushed to overperform the government in crisis management and to enact their agenda. Simultaneously, the pandemic elevated the relevance of local governments, as municipalities organized testing, took care of the elderly and implemented measures limiting mobility. Fidesz used the COVID-19 pandemic and the state of emergency to deprive opposition-led municipalities of their vehicle tax and business tax revenues, pushing them into a fiscal limbo and preventing them from realizing any of their major policy pledges in the absence of available non-earmarked funds. Analyzing original data from government decrees on local transfers, the study contributes to the existing literature by conceptualizing fiscal strangulation as part of electoral authoritarian regimes' toolbox to discredit opposition parties and their ability to govern locally.",Central European University,,,,,,,,Central European University,,Dániel Kovarek,,,,,,,,Dániel Kovarek,,Europe (Central and Eastern),Comparative Politics,Local Government,Quantitative,Austerity,,,,Masking the Strangulation of Opposition Parties as Pandemic Response: Austerity Measures Targeting the Local Level in Hungary,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63460&EventID=185
0,"With its “Green Deal”, the European Commission has recently set out a significant reconfiguration of its normative political aspirations. In a discursive dimension, climate change and the aim to make Europe the first ‘climate-neutral’ continent by 2050 is prioritized as the most critical challenge of EU politics. Nevertheless, to make the Green Deal meaningful beyond discourse, these ambitions require translation into sectoral and decentralised governance. One sector that is undisputedly central in that regard is transport & mobility. However, EU policy efforts to address mobility issues have up to this point been highly fragmented, with a lack of coordination between actors within the Commission and beyond. This becomes particularly visible in the field of urban mobility, where limited regulatory competencies of the EU encounter the materialization and politicization of sustainability-related potentials and conflicts.
Starting from this observation, in this paper, I submit that the ecological - e.g., combating climate change - and the social and economic dimensions of sustainability particularly collide with regard to local implementation in areas such as urban mobility. Building on the critical-constructivist heuristic of norm translation, I assume that such contested understandings of what sustainability means in urban mobility are constituted and move between different realms and levels of EU governance, both vertically and horizontally. They surpass different policy sectors (such as transport, energy, regional development, environment…) and are enacted by various actors in an arena surpassing the local, regional, national and European scale. Due to this decentered nature of norm dynamics I advance the argument that a more comprehensive and hence meaningful translation of sustainability is subject to power-infused interactions and knowledge integration within the arena of EU urban mobility governance.
To empirically illustrate this conceptual proposition, I present the results of an in-depth qualitative-interpretative analysis of the arena of EU urban mobility governance. I integrate findings from document analyses, over 50 expert and stakeholder interviews, as well as my own participatory observations both in the EU and in different local contexts. I derive two main findings from this study. First, I observe that the social and economic dimensions of urban mobility dominate local discourses and the reasoning within governance networks and EU strategies. Amidst their growing salience, ecological questions of sustainability and, thus, the climate dimension are not coherently integrated into these dynamics. Second, I am also able to illuminate procedural and structural factors that impact the horizontally and vertically fragmented translation of sustainability in EU urban mobility governance. I conclude that a more comprehensive yet locally meaningful translation of sustainability in the light of the climate crisis can only be achieved by a substantial reconfiguration of EU governance and its underlying procedural paradigms.",Westfälische Wilhelms-Universität Münster,,,,,,,,Westfälische Wilhelms-Universität Münster,,Nils Stockmann,,,,,,,,Nils Stockmann,,Environmental Policy,European Union,Local Government,Climate Change,,,,,Meaning-making between global aspirations and local realities: Contested sustainability in EU urban mobility governance,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64640&EventID=185
0,"Scientific definitions of diversity and how to measure and research them vary among scholars and schools of thought (e.g. Vertovec 2021, Hirschauer 2017). In Germany migration background is most often utilized as a de-facto measure for diversity despite critique on its efficacy to capture diversity in its various forms (Wölfer et al. in review). For the German national administration, not much data exists on the diversity in its workforce or the handling of diversity management in its work culture. First quantitative studies have started to fill this gap (Ette et.al. 2016, 2020), on the level of local administration others have also captured data on diversity quantitatively (Aikins et.al. 2018), adding ability, socio-economic status, age, sexual orientation, and religion to the measure of migration background. Qualitative studies have also so far only explored the context of local administrations (Lang 2020). However, mixed methods data that takes a comprehensive look at diversity in Germany’s national administration is currently missing. The project “Diversity in Germany’s National Administration” aims to fill this gap by combining qualitative and quantitative data examining one branch of Germany’s national administration. 

This paper will take a closer look at the methodological design of the study specifically focusing on how diversity is to be studied through qualitative methods. Specifically, we argue that in combination with quantitative measurements the use of two innovative items in addition to traditional interview questions in qualitative data collection is a useful methodological step to capture definitions of and attitudes towards various forms of diversity and discrimination. First, the qualitative design incorporates visual material. While the use of various forms of visual media has a long tradition in qualitative research (cf. Flick 2016:195), visual media to study diversity or experiences of discrimination are most common in studies with youth (cf. Dumangane 2020, Miller-Idriss & Graefe-Geusch 2019) situated in Anglo-American regions. However, the use of visual material may open new rooms for reflection, deepen discursive spaces and provide a concrete focus abstract topic (cf. ibid). Second, we employ vignettes in qualitative data collection. While the use of vignettes in quantitative data collection is common in Germany (cf. Schnurr 2003; Drouhot et.al. 2021) they are less common in qualitative data collection. They are also employed to provide room for the reconstruction of tacit knowledge in interviews (Schnurr 2003:393) and are thus an ideal tool to access attitudes towards diversity and discrimination. Using preliminary data from the interviews, this paper will show that both methodological additions to traditional qualitative interview questions can be gainfully used for exploring attitudes towards diversity and discrimination with public administration workers. 

Given the current demographic and social changes in Germany towards a more diverse population and more support for diversity within the population (Drouhot et.al. 2021) it is crucially important that German national public administration accommodate these trends in the way they act and reflect them in their employee pool. It is thus of utmost importance that we have reliable data on various forms of diversity within Germany. The methodologically innovative design of this study seeks to provide a first step towards this goal.",DeZIM Institute,German Institute for Integration and Migration Research (DeZIM),German Institute for Integration and Migration Research (DeZIM),,,,,,German Institute for Integration and Migration Research (DeZIM),,Ralf Wölfer,Sabrina Zajak,Annett Graefe-Geusch,,,,,,Annett Graefe-Geusch,,Integration,Migration,Public Administration,Representation,Political Sociology,Qualitative,,,Measuring Diversity in Germany’s Public Administration Workforce: A qualitative Exploration of diverse Identities,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65782&EventID=185

0,"The effect of candidate traits in open and flexible PR systems have recently attracted academic attention (van Erkel and Thijssen 2016; Marcinkiewicz and Stegmaier 2015) and the preferential voting has been perceived as a sign of personalization of politics (Elmelund-Praestekaer and Hopmann 2012; Wauters et al. 2018). It has been proposed that personalization of politics has led to the decline of preferential votes for the candidates other than party leaders due to ‘centralized’ personalization of politics (Wauters et al. 2018). Changes in the media consumption and increasing role of TV have been driving personalization of politics and consequently the use of preferential votes by voters (Elmelund-Praestekaer and Hopmann 2012). In order to analyze the long-term media effects on preferential voting, we use the preferential voting data from six parliamentary elections in the Czech Republic held between 2002 and 2021 combined with data on media presence of candidates in various media types (TV, radio, print and online). The level of preferential voting for candidates on different ballot positions remains rather stable over the 20 year-long period. In addition, the higher media exposure is indeed associated with higher number of preferential votes. However, when media types are distinguished, the presence of candidates in TV does not have a significant positive effect on preferential votes unlike other types of media such as print newspaper and online media.","Institute of Sociology, Czech Academy of Sciences",Charles University,,,,,,,Charles University,,Lukáš Linek,Michael Škvrňák,,,,,,,Michael Škvrňák,,Elections,Elites,Campaign,Candidate,Electoral Behaviour,Voting Behaviour,,,Media effects on preferential voting,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64820&EventID=185
0,"The current pandemic has incited several highly moralized political debates. In the early stages of the pandemic those who didn’t comply with preventive behaviors, such as social distancing, were the object of strong moral condemnation by the media and fellow citizens. More recently, the question of COVID-19 vaccines has been strongly politicized and become a highly moralized issue in many countries. Even though moralized attitudes are a foundational element of political debates and conflicts, the actual processes of moralization, and the effects of news media in the process of moralization, are rather poorly understood.

Previous research on the field of framing theory has demonstrated how the framing of issues affect public opinion and attitudes. According to framing theory, subtle changes in the ways news media reports on issues might influence people’s attitudes and behaviors. Framing theory suggests that episodic frames (frames that focus on a specific individual’s story) are more likely to incite emotional responses compared to thematic frames (frames that describe the issue on a general level). Also, earlier studies have shown that there is a path relationship from emotional responses to moral views. 

The objective of this study is to understand how different types of media frames stimulate emotional responses and lead to moralized attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccines. We present a preliminary design for a survey experiment on media framing effects in the context of COVID-19 vaccines. Our data were derived from the fourth wave of Digital Age in Finland -longitudinal survey collected in December 2021 (N=545). To test the effects of framing, we randomly assigned the respondents to three different groups, which each were presented with one of the following news snippet frames that discuss the COVID-19 vaccines: neutral frame (control group), episodic frame, and thematic frame. After reading the different prompts, we measure respondents’ emotional responses and attitudes in three different dimensions: moral emotions, moral judgements, attitudes.

First, we found that the episodic framing affected respondents' moral emotions toward unvaccinated. Those respondents who read the episodic framing experienced less disgust and more compassion for unvaccinated when compared to the control group and less anxiety and fear if compared to respondents with the thematic framing. Our results also showed that exposure to the thematic framing mitigates the respondents ’moral judgements when measuring the right not to be vaccinated and right to act as unvaccinated in society during the pandemic. Moreover, we found that episodic framing reduced negative moral attitudes related to the exclusion of unvaccinated from society. Finally, the mediation analysis suggested that differences in moral judgments and attitudes were indirect through the moral emotions risen with framing.

Overall, our study used a unique experimental survey and provides new evidence that the framing of news has a clear impact on emotions and moral views toward unvaccinated. The news media play a key role in communicating risks during the crisis, as evidenced by the fact that the news primarily stimulates emotions, influencing the different attitudes and judgments of citizens.",University of Turku,University of Turku,University of Turku,,,,,,University of Turku,,Ilkka Koiranen,Aki Koivula,Eetu Marttila,,,,,,Aki Koivula,,Media,Communication,Survey Experiments,,,,,,Media Frames and Emotional Responses to Moralized Issues: An Experimental Study of Attitudes and Views related to unvaccinated in Finland,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64750&EventID=185
0,"Research shows that voters hold different views about the supposed winners and losers of an election: election winners might be those who finished in first place or parties that gained votes compared to the last election. Moreover, subjective factors such as partisan preferences affect how they perceive the election results. In this paper, we study the influence of media framing on citizens’ perceptions of election winners and losers. We argue that such media framing affects whether voters perceive a party as an election winner or loser. We test this expectation based on two pre-registered studies: first, a survey experiment with randomized news frames of an otherwise identical election result and second, a two-wave (pre-post) survey and media content analysis in the context of the 2021 German election. Preliminary results from the experiment suggest that positive (negative) framing of election results influences voter perceptions of winners (losers). The results also corroborate our expectation that respondents are more likely to identify parties as election winners (losers) if they like (dislike) the respective party. Yet, we find no evidence for our expectation that framing effects are strongest for voters with a moderate level of party sympathy; positive (negative) framing effects tend to be strongest among respondents who like (dislike) the respective party. Our second study, which is still being finalised, additionally allows assessing the extent to which voters perceive certain parties as legitimate or not.

0,"Since 2011 Syrian migration has been studied through the ongoing conflict, where the exile of
6 million refugees turned out to be the major life event for collective memory. The civil war
has not only become a new topic on the scientific agenda. It also acts as a lens through which
Syrian memories are reconstructed, particularly the trajectories, the use of violence and
persecution experienced by migrants. On the contrary, the memory of Syrian migrants before
the 2011 conflict is a theme that is not yet sufficiently explored in contemporary research.
This prevents us from taking into consideration not only different trajectories and experiences
of migration, but a longer term past by including other memories in our reflection.
Starting from this assumption, this contribution deals with a longer-lasting Syrian migration in
Belgium and it aims at questioning how Syrian memories are built beyond trauma.
Syrian migration to Belgium started in the ‘70s. This community includes - among others -
students who chose to continue their career in Belgium, entrepreneurs who built their business,
or Christian Syrians who fled certain reforms of the Syrian regime, until the refugees of the last
waves who escaped the ongoing civil war. Through in-depth biographical and semi-directive
interviews with Syrians having migrated before 2011, I specifically focus on the construction
of events and personal trajectories, what is considered legitimate to tell and on what experiences
are recognised as evocative to be remembered. In particular, the research shows the complexity
of thinking about one’s own trajectories beyond the analytical frames used for the last refugee
flows; in this sense, the relationship between identity and migration has often been
schematically expressed as opposition between ""pro-regime"" and ""against regime” positions,
reducing the way of thinking of oneself beyond this dichotomic approach as well as beyond the
traumatic perspective of the ongoing conflict and political crisis.
By analysing some field outcomes, this contribution has a double perspective: at first, it aims
at exploring memories of Syrian migrants who are not sufficiently studied in migration
literature, nor present in Syrian collective memory. Secondly, these ordinary memoires “beyond
trauma” suggest to analytically understand Syrian political identity renegotiation after 2011.
To conclude, this contribution aims at understanding and then empirically describing how
memories are constructed, what constitutes “memory” for Syrian migrants before 2011 and how
their memory is articulated with the experience of post-conflict migrants.",Université Saint Louis Bruxelles,,,,,,,,Université Saint Louis Bruxelles,,Virginia Fanny Faccenda,,,,,,,,Virginia Fanny Faccenda,,Migration,Identity,Memory,Refugee,,,,,Memory beyond trauma.

0,"According to theories of cognitive linguistics, metaphors shape our perception of reality. They are seen as essential in making sense of abstract and complex topics. Metaphors therefore play an important role for communication in general and for political communication in particular. While scholarship has already examined metaphors in political communication, most studies have focused on single, highly specific metaphors. The metaphorical framing of topics throughout entire political debates and the systematic use of language by specific actors, on the other hand, have yet to be comprehensively examined. In particular, comparative studies about the use of metaphors by different German political parties are so far lacking.
We address this research gap by analyzing the metaphorical framing of Europe/the European Union by members of the German federal parliament, the Bundestag, in debates on government statements on the European Council between 2015 and 2019. Since Bundestag debates explicitly address the public and all speakers refer to the same topic, they are particularly promising starting points for the comparative analysis of various parties’ use of metaphors. This data allows us, among other things, to examine differences between government and opposition parties, left and right parties, populist and non-populist parties and pro-European and Eurosceptical parties.
By focusing on the framing of Europe/the European Union, we are able to identify images of Europe in Germany.

0,"Until fairly recently, political theorists generally avoided explicit discussion of ‘methods’ or ‘methodology’ (by contrast with empirical political science, (in)famously riven by methodological debate). Over the last decade and a half, however, there has been a marked increase of scholarly interest in the subject. But what are scholars talking about when they speak of ‘method’ or ‘methodology’ in the context of political theory? This is not at all obvious, in part because few if any protagonists in these debates provide any precise definitions of ‘method’ or ‘methodology’. In consequence, these debates tend to conflate distinct issues surrounding research aims, techniques, epistemologies and ontologies, and exaggerate the extent to which contrasts between theorists on these issues reflect necessary disputes as opposed to mere differences of contribution. This retreads a fraught path of methodological conflict already walked in political science, which we think political theory would best avoid. In this paper, our aims are twofold. First, we define and clarify the terms and distinctions involved in such debates – distinguishing method from methodology (frequently conflated) as well as from similarly underspecified terms such as ‘technique’ and ‘approach’. Second, we identify what is at stake in these distinctions – why they matter, and to what end they take us. In doing so, we hope to pave the way for a more clear-headed debate in the discipline, identifying the major theoretical and practical questions that underlie our present disagreements, and parsing those that instantiate substantive philosophical disputes, from those that merely reflect different (but mutually compatible) epistemic goals. We conclude by sketching a progressive strategy of future debate which eschews the construction of competing ‘paradigms’ of political theory research – common in empirical political science – and instead furnishes a diverse methodological toolkit, with different tools understood as contributing to normative, theoretical and empirical knowledge in different ways.",Kings College London,,,,,,,,Kings College London,,Jonathan Leader Maynard,,,,,,,,Jonathan Leader Maynard,,Political Theory,Analytic,Critical Theory,Methods,Realism,Ethics,Normative Theory,Empirical,Method and Methodology in Political Theory,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64850&EventID=185
0,"If everyday politics is characterised by rhetoric, and political philosophy by reason, what are the proper methods of argument for what might be called the art of ‘public political philosophy’? This is an important question, given that scholars are increasingly encouraged to practice this art, in the pursuit of ‘engagement’, ‘impact’, ‘relevance’, and so on, yet it is unclear exactly what it is they should be doing to achieve these things, and indeed if they should be attempting them at all, given various worries. For example, what if, in the pursuit of relevance, we overly simplify our arguments, or align them too quickly with the status quo? What if we target them at topics that are popular and straightforward at the expense of those that, ultimately, are both important and more complicated? And does it make a difference if we do this professionally, from the platform of our institutional affiliations, as opposed to personally, from the platform of our social media accounts?
In this paper I suggest range of examples of good and bad public political philosophy, as well as a set of particular methods worth deploying, with suitable caution, as gleaned in part from those examples. This guidance should help to orientate scholars when encouraged or pressured to practise this art, but also hopefully enrich wider conversations in our subject around how and when we should engage with the ‘real world’, whether pursued under the banners of realism, non-ideal theory, ‘political’ political theory, or some other debate altogether.",University of Bristol,,,,,,,,University of Bristol,,Jonathan Floyd,,,,,,,,Jonathan Floyd,,Political Methodology,Political Theory,Normative Theory,,,,,,Methods of Public Political Philosophy,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65123&EventID=185
0,"Protests are a collective endeavor. Those who take to the streets necessarily do this not alone, but together with (many) others. However, those who demonstrate do not simply do so together with everyone else who is also taking part in the same demonstration. Instead, the decision to go to a demonstration is often influenced by specific others or even made together with them. People often go to a demonstration together with friends, acquaintances, colleagues or family members, i.e. with people to whom a more or less close social bond already exists before the demonstration. A person’s social networks thus play a decisive role in mobilizing protest participants. The existing literature widely acknowledges the importance of personal contacts for political mobilization, but so far data on mobilizing networks has only been gathered in few studies and in these studies protest participants usually only were asked to indicate which persons or organizations had played a role in their decision to participate in the respective protest. Studies were thus able to observe the effects of networks on protest participation, but the actual mobilization process and the structure of the mobilizing networks remained opaque. In an international survey of participants of the Fridays for Future demonstrations in March, September and November 2019 in nine European countries, we now, for the first time, included a set of network questions that allow us to observe also the mobilizing activity of protest participants. By asking protesters about the scope and the success of their own attempts to mobilize others to participate in the protests, we are able to analyze not only the effect of mobilizing networks (reported mobilization channels) but to investigate in more detail the structure of these mobilizing networks and function they play in political mobilizations (reported mobilization efforts and their success). The paper draws on data from these surveys in order to identify distinct types of micro-mobilizers.",Universität Bremen,,,,,,,,Universität Bremen,,Sebastian Haunss,,,,,,,,Sebastian Haunss,,Social Movements,Mobilisation,Political Engagement,Protests,Activism,,,,Micromobilization networks at demonstrations,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65937&EventID=185
0,"In a context of increased ethnic diversity, the access of third-country nationals to welfare rights across the EU has become a major area of concern. Existing evidence shows growing unemployment levels amongst this group of mobile individuals, with almost half of them being at risk of poverty or social exclusion (Eurostat 2019). Moreover, their access to European welfare systems has become highly salient in public debates (European Social Survey 2016) and political discourses (Schmidt, Blauberger & Martinsen 2018; Ruhs & Palme 2018). Against this background, this paper seeks to understand how and why EU Member States ensure the social protection of non-EU foreign residents by concluding Bilateral Social Security Agreements (BSSAs) with their origin countries. Drawing on an original dataset of all BSSAs that each EU Member State signed with the top five origin countries of third-country nationals residing in its territory, we show that the gradual bilateral collaboration in this field led to an increased proportion of non-EU migrants having access to welfare rights across EU27. Yet, our analysis also reveals that EU countries often followed a rather strategic rationale when selecting with which origin countries to conclude such agreements and for which policy areas. The anticipation of potential costs of BSSAs for European welfare systems explains Member States’ preference for concluding bilateral social security conventions only with specific third countries, while also shedding light on the array of welfare rights covered by these agreements.",Université de Liège,Sciences Po Paris,,,,,,,Université de Liège,,Daniela Vintila,Angeliki Konstantinidou,,,,,,,Daniela Vintila,,Migration,Welfare State,International,Comparative Perspective,Member States,,,,Migrants’ Welfare Rights across EU27: The Logic of Selectivity in Bilateral Social Security Agreements,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63371&EventID=185
0,"In response to widespread dissatisfaction with contemporary politics, recent years have seen an upsurge in the use of deliberative minipublics. It is, however, far from clear whether and how minipublics can address political dissatisfaction. To assess if minipublics can shoulder this task, it is crucial to look at what minipublics add to the existing representative system and how this change is perceived by the general public. In this paper, I put forward that minipublics introduce a fundamental shift in who is involved in decision-making by adding a small subset of ordinary citizens. This, I argue, could signify greater trust in the make-up of involved actors when minipublics are used – especially in these times wherein many people hold elected politicians in low regard. And if it does, I expect that such greater trust may, in turn, spill over into higher levels of perceived legitimacy of the decision-making process and its outcomes. To test these arguments, I will use pre-registered, original data from a cross-sectional survey (n = 1,789), a conjoint experiment and two survey experiments (fielded in Spring 2022) in Belgium. In doing so, this paper aims to provide novel insights into the role that minipublics can play in addressing political dissatisfaction among the public at large.",University of Leuven,,,,,,,,University of Leuven,,Lisa van Dijk,,,,,,,,Lisa van Dijk,,Political Participation,Decision Making,Public Opinion,Policy-Making,,,,,"Minipublics as a remedy for political dissatisfaction?

We use 1.200 documents (political decisions and knowledge sources) as data to examine relationships between evidence and decisions in relation to active labor market policy and primary education policy in Denmark in the period from 2016-2021.

0,"The presence of minority representatives is generally discussed along their contributions to ethnic and/or religious minority identities in political arenas. Coming from a politically disadvantaged background, however, might bring further offerings to pluralistic democracies. Minority representatives can challenge a limited understanding of politics that is shaped along the interests of upper-class white men. Groups that have been similarly excluded from political representation mechanisms may build solidarity in making democracies more pluralist (Ceyhan, 2018; Phillips, 1995; Saward, 2006). With similar experiences, it is possible to develop awareness of common problems and to follow inclusive policies towards the traditionally excluded segments in political representation mechanisms (Philips, 1995: 2; Saward, 2006), i.e. the disabled, LGBTI people, the poor, and women.  This study asks how often and in what ways do minority MPs address other politically disadvantaged groups. To answer this question, the researchers conduct a content analysis on parliamentary questions posted by minority and non-minority MPs in the Netherlands. The Dutch case has been particularly selected by taking the high number of minority representatives of migratory backgrounds into consideration.

0,"Long-established liberal democracies are having foundational narratives challenged historically in different ways. This is particularly the case of settler colonial states. In Canada, the treatment of Indigenous people has been the object of continuous inquiries, including the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (2009-2015), which examined human rights violations that occurred in indigenous residential schools over the period 1874–1996; or the National Inquiry into Murdered and Missing Indigenous Women and Girls (2016-2019). In the United States, slavery and racism are being re-examined in light of ongoing structural violence against black people. Grassroots truth-seeking initiatives are mushrooming to confront a past of gross violations of human rights. In Australia, the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission (1995-1997), investigated the separation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children from their families and the Yoo-rrook Justice Commission has examined the impact of European colonization on the Aboriginal communities of Victoria State (2021). In Scandinavia, the Greenlandic Reconciliation Commission (2014-2017) has investigated the policies of dispossession and assimilation suffered by indigenous peoples. Others include the Commission to Investigate the Norwegianization Policy and Injustice against the Sámi and Kven/Norwegian Finnish Peoples (2018 to date); or the Truth and Reconciliation Commission for the Tornedalians, Kvens and Lantalaiset in Sweden (2020 to date).

This re-examining foundational narratives mirrors what other countries emerging from armed conflict or authoritarian rule are also doing to come to terms with a recent past of violations. These countries have also established truth-seeking and other mechanisms to deal with their pasts and to establish the conditions for sustainable and inclusive peace, so that these violations do not happen again. Over forty truth commissions have been established in the last forty years to establish an accepted narrative of what happened and to deal with a past of recent violations. 

Notwithstanding these violations were committed long time ago, or rather more recently, what both contexts show are ongoing violations. In postconflict or post authoritarian regimes, these violations are very present mostly in terms of violations to physical rights. In long-established liberal democracies, attention should be given to the effects of the colonial enterprise, most visible today in terms of discrimination against indigenous groups and failure to fulfil basic social rights.

Experts have highlighted the important role of history education, among other measures, in transitional justice processes. Interestingly, history education remains contentious or has not adequately incorporated an understanding of past violence and atrocities. We argue that this is in part because of the extent to which a recognition of past and present injustices fundamentally challenges core aspects of national identity that education plays a central role in fostering. Experiences of colonial and racial violence, exclusion and dispossession are difficult to integrate into well-established narratives that are structured around a relatively consistent adherence to core liberal values. Yet, we maintain, integrating these experiences and recognizing continuities between past and present forms of injustice is essential if these values and their emphasis on equality, rights and justice are to be realized.",Universitat Oberta de Catalunya,University of Glasgow,,,,,,,Universitat Oberta de Catalunya,,Carles Fernández Torné,Graeme Young,,,,,,,Carles Fernández Torné,,Human Rights,Narratives,Peace,Transitional justice,,,,,Mirroring Truths: How liberal democracies are challenging their foundational narratives,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64979&EventID=185

This recommendation signals a growing recognition, as experimental research itself grows in prevalence in political science, that deceptive practices pose ethical problems. But what is problematic about misinformation in particular? I argue that while this question certainly has an ethical dimension, misinformation is bad for inference too.

0,"Social media has become a major arena for political discourse and competition, but also an increasingly hostile environment. For women in particular, social media offers direct communication with citizens without the intermediary of traditional media. However, they are also more exposed to uncivil responses from their followers. Is this a particular phenomenon for female politicians, and does the form of interaction differ to other MPs? We investigate whether female MPs in Germany and Switzerland are more likely to use uncivil language in their online campaigns and whether they are more likely to be criticized, attacked, or subjected to online incivility by other users. 

When the media covers female leaders, they often make use of sexist stereotypes: Traditional notions of leadership include exclusively masculine qualities such as competence, assertiveness, and strength, while female leaders are portrayed as empathetic, caring and consensus oriented. Because politics is an area largely dominated by men, male MPs are automatically considered qualified for public office. On the contrary, women are often assigned domestic roles such as wife or mother by the media, which puts their ability to hold public office into question. Female politicians are therefore confronted with a double-bind: they are either portrayed by the media as feminine, likeable, and sympathetic - or as competent. This double-bind also depends on party affiliation: Female stereotypes are often associated with liberal parties, which leads to women being perceived to be more liberal than they actually are. 

The immediacy of online communication gives female politicians the opportunity to combat such gendered stereotypes by communicating in a more confrontational and aggressive manner. We test the hypothesis that female politicians are more likely to attack their opponents on a personal level using uncivil language. Because stereotypes are also associated with party affiliation, we assume that female politicians of conservative parties are more likely to use uncivil language in their tweets. However, female MPs might also be judged more harshly by voters when using such tactics. Therefore, we test the hypothesis that if female politicians use uncivil language on their Twitter account, they are also more likely to get uncivil replies from their followers, compared to their male colleagues.

We developed a codebook to code 12,000 German tweets for personal and uncivil attacks in order to train a BERT transformer model to classify all responses to social media posts of German and Swiss politicians. We find that compared to male politicians, women are less likely to attack their opponents using uncivil language, and that they are also less likely to be attacked by other users but that they are over proportionally targeted if they use uncivil language themselves.",University of Basel,University of Basel,University of Basel,Universität Mannheim,,,,,University of Basel,,Stefanie Bailer,Jana Boukemia,Sebastien Boyer,Marius Sältzer,,,,,Jana Boukemia,,Gender,Social Media,Communication,,,,,,"Misogyny, politics and social media – Determinants of hostile engagement of female Parliamentarians on Twitter",https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64692&EventID=185
0,"While feedback can be the driver of major policy change, the concept also has mileage in explaining sequences of gradual policy changes, which essentially maintain the policy paradigm. Recent research has make substantial progress in understanding feedback processes but there are still gaps in our knowledge. The policy feedback literature distinguishes between positive and negative feedbacks. The former type of feedback can be self-reinforcing, referring to circumstances in which positive reactions to policy effects reinforce the existing policy trajectories. Negative feedbacks refer to reactions to policy effects which increasingly and gradually weakens support for policy.

Recent research has demonstrated that positive and negative feedbacks can occur simultaneously within a policy. Such mixed policy feedbacks tend to occur when policy is composed of multiple objectives and a mixture of policy instruments. Such multi-dimensional policies engage different constituencies. These tend to react differently to policy effects and thus feed different messages back to policy makers. Using these recent research findings as the starting point, we engage with the concept of mixed feedbacks to highlight aspects of the phenomenon that have hitherto not been explored in detail and more nuance is added to the feedback argument. Our first argument of this paper is that single purpose policies may also generate mixed feedbacks. Each instrument of a policy using multiple instruments to achieve a single objective generates distinct feedbacks. Negative feedback is usually assumed to undermine policy, and indeed the policy paradigm. We challenge this assumption and our second argument suggests that negative feedback may indeed contribute to maintaining policy. For policy to endure over longer periods of time, it needs to respond to feedbacks. This can be done through recalibration of policy instruments or redesign of the policy mix. Our third argument is that mixed instrument feedbacks over a period of time can result in substantial reshuffling of a policy mix through recalibration of instruments, changing their role from minor to major and vice versa, and through gradual and cautious layering of new instruments on to the mix. Eventually, such changes can result in a rebalancing of the instrument package while remaining within the paradigm originally adopted. 

In this study, we use the policy trajectory of Danish nitrogen pollution regulation over almost three decades to illustrate the three theoretical arguments outlined above. The policy had a single purpose of reducing nitrogen leaching from agricultural production but generated mixed feedbacks. We demonstrate the role of positive and negative instrument feedbacks in significantly reshaping the policy mix within the regulatory paradigm set out in the early 1990s. One important insight is that though negative feedbacks played a significant role in reshaping the policy, they did not undermine the policy. Such feedback was mainly restricted to one particular major instrument but did not question the policy paradigm. Noteworthy, it did not result in abolishment of the instrument. Rather, it was downgraded and became a voluntary instrument. One of the other instrument was recalibrated and became the major measure.",University of Copenhagen,University of Copenhagen,,,,,,,University of Copenhagen,,Giulia Bazzan,Carsten Daugbjerg,,,,,,,Carsten Daugbjerg,,Environmental Policy,Public Policy,Regulation,Policy Change,Policy-Making,,,,Mixed policy feedback in environmental regulation: Instrument recalibration and layering in Danish nitrogen pollution policy,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63524&EventID=185
0,"In 2020, President of the United States Donald Trump launched an unprecedented electoral manipulation campaign to secure himself a second term in office regardless of what the voters decided. In 2021, the Republican Party has followed in his footsteps.
This paper presents a new model to describe Trump’s attack on the 2020 Presidential elections. Thereafter, the model is applied to the actions of the Republican Party in 2021 to analyze whether the party has continued to resort to the same electoral manipulation tactics that Trump used in 2020.
The model is primarily based on a database that was constructed by conducting a keyword search in the Washington Post digital archive. The search covered all news reports published in the Washington Post print newspaper from April 1st 2020 to January 20th 2021. New information that has surfaced since then has been taken into consideration when finalizing the model. 
The search was limited to one print newspaper to keep the amount of research material reasonable, and one large newspaper was considered sufficient because newsrooms have the custom of quoting or following up on each other’s news stories. 
Electoral manipulation is analyzed in this paper as a sign of autocratization, which is defined as the process during which a democracy becomes less democratic or an autocracy becomes more deeply autocratic.
According to this study, Trump used seven different electoral manipulation methods: 1) disinformation, 2) voter suppression, 3) intimidation and violence, 4) intraparty pressure, 5) attacking government institutions, 6) breaking democratic norms and 7) attempted collusion with foreign states.
Trump’s strategy combined A) old and familiar election rigging methods (1, 2 and 3), B) methods favored in the recent past by democratically elected leaders with authoritarian tendencies (4 and 5)  and C) methods taken from the playbook of foreign election meddling (1 and 7). Trump’s electoral manipulation campaign does not fit neatly into other electoral manipulation models that have been presented in previous research.
In 2021, the Republican Party has continued to use at least six out of the seven tactics, as it prepares for the midterms and the 2024 Presidential elections. The party has spread disinformation to gain political advantage and enacted new legislation that makes it easier to manipulate future elections. It has contributed to a culture of violence and intimidation, which may deter democracy-respecting citizens from seeking positions as election officials, leaving room for Big Lie promoters to take their place.

First, it reviews the quantitative and qualitative evidence on the historical use of differentiation from 1958 to 2020, finding that it is a common but relatively secondary feature of European integration and that the three idealtypical models identified in the literature (multi-speed, multi-tier, and multi-menu) are deployed in an eclectic, versatile, and constrained manner, which could be termed ‘reluctant differentiation’. Second, it examines and assesses a sample of 21 reform proposals covering the full range of possibilities for the future development of the EU: from total disintegration to a federal union, from maximum uniformity to sustained differentiation, the use of different differentiation models, and other design elements.

0,"Polish legal regulations allow cites to create the sub-municipal units. As the Act on Local Self-Government defines it very generally, the cities have autonomy to divide their territories and to create the additional organs in them. How they are shaped fully depends on the city authorities and their approach. Therefore the models of neighbourhood governance in Poland vary in different cities. The paper presents the results of research made in 66 Polish county cities, in which it was investigated if the system of neighbourhood governance was implemented (or not) and what types of units do the cities create (small number of bigger districts, or big number of smaller neighbourhoods). It was investigated and compared how these structures are shaped: the local councils and boards, as executives and modes of their elections. Another point of the analysis were tasks and competences devolved to this level, and related to this, the legal tools which can be used by the local councils and bords to execute their tasks. The amount of financial means given to the neighbourhood authorities and in what mode they can be spent, were also examined and compared, as in this aspect cities implement various policies.

Therefore the question was answered to what extend Polish cities create similar systems of neighbourhood governance and to what they differ. For this purpose Polish forms of neighbourhood governance were confronted with the ideal types proposed by Lowndes and Sullivan (2007) and it was examined which cities can be categorized as those which realize neighbourhood empowerment, partnership, and which ones realize neighbourhood government, or management. This will be supplemented with the proposal of the new typology of the neighbourhood governance which bases on Polish experiences where three alternative models were created. Firstly, the devolved local government, in which neighbourhoods have their own part in the city budget, office with professional administration, make binding decisions and provide public services. Second is the intermediate model in which neighbourhood organs get significant budget to spend, and limited independent decisions to make, but there is no professional neighbourhood administration and service provision. Third type is the participatory model in which the neighbourhood bodies are tools of public participation, where the members work voluntarily (in some cases with small diet) and neighbourhood role is deliberative and consulting, and in fact they have only supplementary functions, as no tasks are devolved to this level.

Out of 66 Polish cities only 46 implemented the means of neighbourhood governance. Two cities – Warsaw and Zielona Góra have a devolved local government system, in which districts were created with wide catalogue of tasks and professional administration. Cracow, Poznań and Gdynia implemented the intermediate system in which the local councils deal with wide range of issues and have a significant budget. The rest of the cities implemented the participative model in which the neighbourhood bords and councils have consultative and supplementary role. Their tasks are to consult, apply and give opinions and not to make binding decisions.",SGH Warsaw School of Economics,,,,,,,,SGH Warsaw School of Economics,,Adam Jarosz,,,,,,,,Adam Jarosz,,Governance,Local Government,Political Participation,Public Administration,Public Policy,,,,Models of Neighbourhood Governance: Case of Poland,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64617&EventID=185
0,"Political rights are tightly related to citizenship status. Political inclusion illustrates how states ensure diaspora members the right to dual citizenship and vote, which are fundamental rights grounded in the concept of a democratic state. The levels and ways states are conducive to political inclusion demonstrate how they perceive their diasporas. This article compares how three states of Central and Eastern Europe (Hungary, Poland, and Lithuania) ensure their diasporas’ political inclusion through dual citizenship recognition and diaspora enfranchisement. The analysis draws on a three-dimensional, narrative, structural, and practical model of diaspora policy. It demonstrates that the democratic rights of citizenship and voting are grounded not only in the formal inclusion, but, more importantly, in the procedure and practical access to those rights, including modes of acquiring or preserving citizenship, and voting modalities from abroad.

0,"Since the end of World War II, the vote share of populist parties in Western societies has constantly been growing, reaching a new high in the last decade. Consequently, the number of populist parties in power has been growing, too. In Europe, populist parties in Italy, Austria, Hungary, Greece, and Poland have recent government records. Although some research has been carried out on the impact of populists in government on policy output and democratic quality, there is still little scientific understanding of the effect that the transition from opposition to government, and sometimes back to opposition, has on the usage of populist communication. Previous studies have argued that populism is much easier to articulate from an oppositional perspective and is incompatible with governing. Implicitly, this means that when populists enter government, they would be expected to tone down their populist rhetoric. 
Germany provides an interesting case for studying populism. With the Alternative for Germany (AfD), right-wing populism has recently established itself in Germany, relatively late compared to other European countries. However, from the long-term historical perspective, left-wing populist Die Linke is Germany's most successful populist party. The party established itself after German reunification in Germany in East Germany as the Partei des Demokratischen Sozialismus (PDS) and entered the Bundestag in 1990. In 2007, the PDS party merged with the West-German Wahlalternative Arbeit und Soziale Gerechtigkeit (WASG) under the new name Die Linke to attract more voters outside East Germany.
Although no populist party has ever been part of the Federal Government in Germany, there is considerable variation at the level of states. While the AfD has never been part of a German state government, the PDS supported a Red-Green minority government as early as 1994 in Saxony Anhalt. Four years later, the PDS joined the state government in Mecklenburg Western Pomerania; in 2002, the party also came into power in Berlin. In 2019, the party joined for the first time a state government in West Germany, Bremen. Nevertheless, Die Linke still faces many challenges in West Germany, as the party is currently not represented in six West German state parliaments.
Although there is little doubt that Die Linke is economically the most left-leaning party in the Bundestag at the federal party, some state branches are considered to be more centrist. In Thuringia, where the state parliament elected the first state prime minister by Die Linke in 2014, some commentators have openly discussed where the party can be considered centrist after the party was leading the government for five years. The following article takes this recent discussion as a starting point and analyzes to what extent the varying relative power positions by Die Linke’s state branches, ranging from extra-parliamentary opposition to leading governing party, are linked to their level of populist discourse. The analysis will cover four years of Facebook communication by Die Linke’s accounts in the 16 states. Populism will be measured by using a multi-word populism dictionary, recently developed based on German social media data.",Westfälische Wilhelms-Universität Münster,,,,,,,,Westfälische Wilhelms-Universität Münster,,Jan Philipp Thomeczek,,,,,,,,Jan Philipp Thomeczek,,Federalism,Political Parties,Populism,Quantitative,Domestic Politics,,,,"Moderate in Power, Populist in Opposition?

Its essence not only in the organisation of mass campaigns, indeed, or allegedly reflecting the opinion of the majority of the population and / or a certain group, but also in the formation of a public opinion by combining the methods of properly lobbying, public relations and advertising. The generally accepted opinion of those who are watching politics is that lobbyists strengthen their activity when the current and important legislation is active on the agenda. The ""agenda"" is constantly changing, but it is vital to trace what is becoming relevant, and what are the wrong to do.

0,"The EU’s current generation of deep and comprehensive trade agreements usually establish treaty bodies that have considerable decision-making powers in order to facilitate the implementation but also the amendment of the agreement. These bodies are staffed jointly by both parties to the agreement. Recent examples are the Joint Committee under the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement.
The establishment of treaty bodies give the EU’s free trade agreements a certain level of autonomy from the EU’s decision-making structures and internally shift power to the executive, which is directly represented in these bodies. From a separation of powers perspective, such a shift raises pressing questions not only about the ability of the European Parliament to control these bodies (see e.g., Weiss, EUConst 2018) but also about the role of the European Court of Justice (ECJ).
The ECJ serves a particular role in EU external relations. While in the internal market the Court shapes the content of rights and freedoms, in external relations it focuses more on ensuring that the institutional balance as enshrined in the Treaties is observed (Cremona, Hart Publishing 2018). External relations are the typical battlegrounds over the correct legal basis, involvement of the European Parliament, and the dividing line between Council’s prerogative under Art 218(9) TFEU to formulate policy and Commission’s right to represent the Union in external relations. In addition, some fundamental principles, such as mutual trust, autonomy of the EU legal order, and sincere cooperation, take particular relevance in external relations (Eckes, CYES, 2021). Another recurring issue for the Court, particularly in the area of common commercial policy, have been the delimitation of competences between the EU and its Member States.
Historically, the Court treated these aspects with caution and scepticism. Institutions were not to be expected to just do the right thing. Instead, explicit guarantees were required. Armed with an ex ante judicial review mechanism (Art 218(11) TFEU) the Court could, thus, wield important power over the prospects of negotiations and, indeed, imprint on the institutional design of international agreements. With the structure of trade and investment agreements changing, however, the lines on the battlefield are being redrawn. Recent agreements are characterized by sophisticated multilevel institutional structures that dedicates political, executive and administrative functions to treaty bodies charged with implementing and amending the agreement throughout its lifetime. 
In this paper we examine the resulting power and the effects for the powers of the Court. The shift from ex ante review to continuous ex post facto control seems to have changed the dynamics of the Court’s role in external relations. The paper (1) examines the institutional structure of post-Lisbon trade and investment agreements, (2) analyses the implications for the Commission’s external powers, (3) conceptualizes the Court’s approach towards assessing these powers, and (4) examines the future implications of establishing numerous treaty bodies on the roles and powers of the EU institutions.",University of Amsterdam,,,,,,,,Aarhus Universitet,,Christina Eckes,,,,,,,,Hannes Lenk,,European Union,Executives,Institutions,Trade,,,,,Monitoring bilateral treaty bodies – a new role for the Court of Justice in external economic relations,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64611&EventID=185

Second, two cases where polyamorous parents were recently granted legal parentage: 2011 BCSC 1588, C.C. (Re), 2018 NLSC 71 and British Columbia Birth Registration No. 2018-XX-XX5815, 2021 BCSC 767. 

Although the latter two cases do not indicate a groundswell, they illustrate a shift in how parentage can be captured by the law. And yet, in the background of these cases (and relevant legislative amendments), lives the ugly step-sister of multi-parent families and multi-conjugal relationships: polygamy. In the Polygamy Reference, Chief Justice Bauman ruled that Canada’s Criminal Code prohibition of polygamy (s.293) is consistent with Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. He argued that in a “free and democratic society” criminalizing polygamy supports the “institution of monogamous marriage” and advances Canada’s international human rights obligations. 

I argue that the expansion of legal parentage (and its subsequent negotiation of who constitutes a family) also requires the enforcement, or re-enforcement, of the familial other; the kinship system against which ‘good’ and ‘ethical’ multi-parent families are measured. In Canada, the condemnation of polygamy as a patriarchal, oppressive, and marginalizing institution is the foil. Further, Canadian discourses surrounding polygamy draw on racialized and gendered constructions that prop-up the idealized, white, monogamous, heterosexual, and homonormative Canadian family. While the idealized Canadian family is white, monogamous, and heterosexual, liberalism’s desire to govern kinship requires a modest expansion of the ideal family to include the idealized queer family. The idealized queer family is not heteronormative but homonormative, a form which asseverates white Canadian nationalism by venerating Canadian discourses of inclusion, diversity, and monogamy (or “monogamish” relationships) without reorganizing the relationship between the family and the state or relationships within families themselves.",University of Alberta,,,,,,,,University of Alberta,,Margot Challborn,,,,,,,,Margot Challborn,,Gender,Government,National Identity,Social Policy,Family,Jurisprudence,Race,LGBTQI,"Monogamy, Polyamory, and Polygamy in Canada: negotiating the expansion and recognition of legal parentage",https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64291&EventID=185
0,"Models for categorical dependent variables, such as turnout, party choice, or partisanship have eluded scholars for decades. Should the coefficients be reported and interpreted or are marginal effects preferable? Can interaction effects be statistical significant even without of product terms? How make sense of multinomial logit models, if their coefficients depend on the choice of the baseline category? There are several papers concerned with such questions, but not all of them can help with researchers' confusion about how to apply and interpret results of these models. Yet much of this confusion about models for categorical dependent variables can be avoided by not asking too much of them and by keeping in mind the distinction between model specification, model parameters, and quantities of interest.

The paper points out that certain aspects of linear regression cannot be generalised without getting into the trouble of paradoxes and ambiguities. Firstly,
it shows how identifying causal effects with differences in means leads to paradoxes while marginal effects do not globally describe the properties of a statistical model for categorical dependent variables. Secondly, it shows that the dependence of coefficients on the choice of a baseline category is not a problem unique to multinomial logit models, but also concerns linear regression models with categorical independent variables. Third, it discusses well-established techniques of statistical inference that allow to deal with this situation without incurring ambiguities. Based on this discussion, the paper derives a set of guidelines for sound inference about generalised linear and related models.",Zeppelin University Friedrichshafen,,,,,,,,Zeppelin University Friedrichshafen,,Martin Elff,,,,,,,,Martin Elff,,Political Methodology,Methods,Quantitative,,,,,,Much Ado About Not Very Much?

0,"The the analysis we are presenting a general picture of European Union level governance system which is influenced by the global activities of the industry and other major players of the field. We shall also make some preliminary reflections in the national level in Finland, which represent one EU member country who is actively developing the EV battery industry. The analysis identifies policy targets, regulatory systems, voluntary mechanisms, coordinating authorities and the relationships between policy-making and business development.

EVs will be vital in reducing air pollution and meeting climate change goals. To achieve this, the International Energy Agency (IEA) forecasts that global EV stock will need to grow by 36% a year, reaching 245 million vehicles in 2030. The needed growth of electric cars is really challenging. It's something that's never really been done before at that rate of growth for a completely new product. One big challenge is the need of special metals for the batteries. EV batteries are large and heavy and they are made up of several hundred individual lithium-ion cells, all of which need dismantling. To reduce the need for new mining, there is a need for rapidly developing circular economy of EV batteries.

The EV battery recycling market is currently a small one, comprising around 100 companies worldwide. But it is growing fast. Many market regions, such as Europe, China and America, already develop policy targets and instruments for the improved circular economy along the EV battery value chain. At the EU level, the Batteries Directive, last amended in 2018, is the main legal act regulating batteries. On December 2020, the Commission published its proposal for a new Sustainable Batteries Regulation as part of its wider strategy for a climate-neutral, resource-efficient EU economy. Recent proposals from the EU have seen EV suppliers responsible for making sure that the batteries will be recycled and car industry and many manufacturers are already starting to step up to the mark. In practice, the EU, global and national level governance and regulatory systems are under active development, and need improved understanding on multi-level interactions for the needed new technological steps.",University of Eastern Finland,University of Eastern Finland,,,,,,,University of Eastern Finland,,Rauno Sairinen,Juha Kotilainen,,,,,,,Rauno Sairinen,,Environmental Policy,Governance,Climate Change,Energy Policy,,,,,Multi-level governance of recycling electric vehicles’ battery metals,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65621&EventID=185
0,"Recent literature has suggested that economic voting should be considered a multidimensional concept where valence economy is one aspect of the compleat economic voter, along with voters’ position on economic policy and their patrimonial belongings, i.e., ownership of assets (Lewis-Beck, Nadeau and Foucault 2013). We run the 2019 Belgian election study which uses a unique set of questions for the national, regional and European Parliament elections held on the same day in May 2019 in Belgium. Using this data we investigate the multidimensionality of economic voting in multilevel governance, combined with a complex federal electoral setting. 
First, we test the compleat economic voter in different types of elections simultaneously, i.e., federal, regional and European Parliament (EP) elections, which provides us with information about different sets of economic voting behaviours among Belgian voters across different types of elections. Second, this allows us to distinguish between first- and second-order elections among the three types of elections. We find evidence that national and regional elections in Belgium have first order characteristics, while EP elections only mirror national competition. Third, our results point to differences among voters, where economic policy is more salient in regional elections as compared to valence economic voting, which is predominant in national competitions. 
Finally, the unique data set of the 2019 Belgian elections - where the two regions, Flanders and Wallonia, had different level of clarity of responsibility (i.e., Wallonia had one incumbent, while Flanders had multiple incumbent parties with changes in government) allows for a test of the clarity of responsibility hypothesis in the regional competitions. Therefore, this structural characteristic adds to the complexity of multilevel government.

0,"The descriptive and substantive representation of women in national parliaments has been a major issue of scholarly and political concern. Recognising the importance of the issue, this paper introduces a new way of studying the representation of women, one that asks women how they want to be represented and examines whether their representatives meet these expectations. The paper specifically draws on the recently developed conceptual framework of multidimensional representation, which distinguishes between four dimensions of representation – surrogation, justification, personalisation, and responsiveness. It develops testable hypotheses about how female constituents’ demands for representation vary depending on the gender of their representative, as well as how the behaviour of representatives differs depending on their own gender. The hypotheses are tested using original survey data from the United Kingdom and data on divisions and speeches in the House of Commons. The results show high levels congruence between the wishes of female constituents and the behaviour of female MPs on the dimensions of surrogation and justification, but not on other dimensions.

0,"The Multiple Streams Framework (MSF) was not developed for understanding multilevel dynamics. Despite this, the framework has been used to study agenda-setting and policy-making processes in policy sectors and political systems where such dynamics are present and salient, for instance in policy fields such as environmental policy, EU governance, and public health that typically are characterized by a transboundary and multilevel nature. The MSF once was developed to understand agenda-setting in national policy contexts, but contains ample possibilities for taking multilevel dynamics into account, as it asks questions about where problems emanate from and how policy ideas are developed. These processes do not need to be confined to national contexts, but can just as well be multilevel in character. Our aim in this paper is to develop a systematic approach to how multilevel dynamics can be incorporated into the MSF, including its influence on the three streams, actor constellations and coupling, as well as windows of opportunity. To capture multilevel dynamics, the role of venues at different political levels is crucial, as is networks spanning several levels and framings of problems and policies. We draw on earlier efforts to theorize the multilevel dynamics in MSF to develop a theoretical answer to the question in what ways multiple streams can also be multilevel. This will, potentially, contribute to better possibilities of capturing and understanding a wide array of policy processes, not least contemporary transformations and transitions such as those implied by policy responses to climate change, the covid-19 pandemic or large migration flows.",Lunds Universitet,,,,,,,,Lunds Universitet,,Åsa Knaggård,,,,,,,,Åsa Knaggård,,Public Policy,Agenda-Setting,Policy Change,Policy-Making,,,,,Multilevel streams?

0,"Competition in academia is by far not new, but in the 21st century its relevance in the field of higher education has reached a new level (Szöllösi-Janze, 2021). As part of this development, various state-initiated competitive funding schemes have been established in Germany. In our study, we address the two largest competitive funding schemes which address teaching and research as the two core missions of universities: The Excellence Initiative and the Quality Pact for Teaching. 
Theoretically, we refer to two major considerations. First and foremost, we will explore the relation between competition in funding schemes and wider competition as ways of organizing academia. Here, we refer to Stark (2020) who summarizes differences between competition and competitions. On the one hand, Stark describes competition as an ongoing, seamless, and seemingly endless process in which individual and organizational actors compete for scarce goods (Stark, 2020, p. 3). On the other hand, competitions are described by him as discrete, bounded in time and space: Competitions are relatively (though never perfectly) separated arenas of rivalry that seek to identify differences of worth in some reasonably consensual and organized fashion (Stark, 2020, p. 3). The two competitive funding schemes we focus on can be understood as competitions according to Stark’s distinction. However, individuals and organizations participating in these competitions will also have goals in the wider and more general competition for scarce goods like reputation, resources, and talent/jobs. Therefore, we suggest that to participate in competitions always relates to goals in the more general competition.
The second theoretical consideration we want to refer to is the crucial role of third parties in competition. Competition is characterized by different elements (Werron, 2015). The first element are the actors that compete for a scarce good. The second element of competition is the scarce good for which these actors compete. The third element are third parties or audiences that become important for the distribution of the scarce good (Werron, 2015, p. 195). In terms of the EI and the QPL, different audiences seem to be relevant. The political government and the ministries of education, intermediary organizations that compare and evaluate performances in competitions, peers in the selection process as reviewers and referees, and potential partner organizations since cooperation can be helpful or even necessary to succeed in competition (Luijten-Lub et al., 2005). Given the important role of the audiences as referees, distributors of the scarce good or potential partners, it is highly important to learn more about who they are and how they are perceived. Thinking about these different audiences, it becomes apparent that not all of them can be easily addressed – potential researchers and students, for example. The way how decisions in ministries are taken and who contributes to them is also often not transparent, and the persons who participate in selection committees of the German Research Foundation are not always known beforehand. This raises the question, how audiences are socially constructed and ‘imagined’ as groups and how related strategies are organized and developed by the universities.",University of Kassel,Universität Kassel,University of Kassel,,,,,,University of Kassel,,Georg Krücken,Nicolai Götze,Tim Seidenschnur,,,,,,Tim Seidenschnur,,Governance,Institutions,Knowledge,Education,Higher Education,Eurozone,Theoretical,,Multiple Competitions in Academia.

Drawing on content analyses of party manifestos (supply side data) and electoral exit poll data (demand side data) in Flanders (Belgium), a fragmented party system, we aim to study the party differentiation along solidarity lines towards Muslims and to what extent this aligns with Muslims’ voting behavior, and issue preferences. Going beyond previous studied cleavages, we expect that Muslims will be cross-pressured between the compassionate solidarity claims of social-democratic and socialist parties and the empathic solidarity claims of Christian-democratic and ecologist parties. Furthermore, we expect preference voting for Muslim candidates will be a convenient solution to deal with the contradiction between redistributive and recognition claims of the political parties.",Universiteit Antwerpen,Universiteit Antwerpen,,,,,,,Universiteit Antwerpen,,Samira Azabar,Peter Thijssen,,,,,,,Peter Thijssen,,Islam,Political Parties,Electoral Behaviour,,,,,,Muslims caught in a struggle between redistribution and recognition.

In this paper, we theorize that inclusive (exclusive) historical representations can increase (decrease) marginalized group members' perceived centrality to the nation, entitlement to speak on its behalf, and likelihood of becoming leaders. In an online experiment in India (N=1,592), we randomly assign participants exercises sourced from official state textbooks that contain either an exclusive, inclusive, or a neutral representation of history. We subsequently assess the supply of and demand for Muslim leadership using both an original, incentivized game and additional survey and behavioral measures. Consistent with our theory, we find that inclusive historical narratives increase Muslim participants' perceived centrality and entitlement, and their willingness to lead.

0,"The 38 decentralised EU agencies are a core component of the European administrative space. EU agencies perform very different tasks, including preparing regulatory decisions, recommending the authorisation of products, supervising implementation and gathering information for EU policy-making. National officials likewise contribute in different ways to EU agencies. They influence EU agencies’ work on management boards, but also in working groups, networks and joint operations. This paper systematically maps both the differences in EU agencies’ formal competences and the embeddedness of national authorities in their governance set-ups. 
For this, the paper, first, presents a fourfold classification of all EU agencies along tasks on the basis of their founding regulation. Second, it measures national authorities’ role through an index of three further provisions from founding regulations: The influence of national representatives on management boards, their involvement through formal networks in EU agencies’ day-to-day work and their strength vis-à-vis other actors such as the Commission and stakeholders. The measurements indicate that functional criteria shape the governance set-up delegators create: We find differences in the formal embeddedness of national representatives across the four task types.

While existing research has sought to provide definitions of sovereignty, we know little about how political actors conceive of it and use it in political conflict. This paper investigates how the Rassemblement National mobilized sovereignty in its contestation of the European Union. Relying on the qualitative analysis of national and EU election manifestoes produced between 1979 and 2019, it shows that in the RN’s early years, sovereignty remained uncontested and the party was mainly concerned about Europe being insufficiently powerful. The RN only developed a consistent sovereignist critique of the EU following the introduction of the Single European Act and the Maastricht Treaty. Drawing primarily on national sovereignty to define the EU as a violation of the principles of autonomy and self-rule, and then increasingly on popular sovereignty to present it as anti-democratic, the RN developed a comprehensive critique of the EU, while defending an alternative conception of Europe as a ‘Europe of the Nations.’",The London School of Economics & Political Science,,,,,,,,The London School of Economics & Political Science,,Marta Lorimer,,,,,,,,Marta Lorimer,,European Politics,European Union,Extremism,National Identity,Nationalism,Party Manifestos,Euroscepticism,,"National, popular, or neither?

0,"Is it possible to reduce the complexity of information contained in evaluation reports of international organizations to a single performance metric? We present a novel approach that employs deep-learning based text classification. At the core is a classification of sentences as negative or positive sentences regarding the evaluated IO activity. Descriptive information classifies as neutral. This enables calculation of the share of sentences containing positive versus negative assessments in evaluation reports – our performance metric. First, we use a deep learning-based contextualized language model to classify sentences. We fine-tune the pre-trained model (BERT) based on 10,296 hand-coded sentences in 180 evaluation reports of nine international organizations. We use 90% of these sentences for the fine-tuning, and 10% to evaluate model performance and find that it classifies with an accuracy of 89%. We secondly apply the model to evaluation reports by the World Bank Independent Evaluation Group, which were not in our original training data. These reports contain a single performance metric provided by evaluators, ranging from unsatisfactory to highly satisfactory. We find that our novel performance metric correlates extremely well with human-provided classifications of IEG evaluation reports. Last, we classify close to one million sentences in 1,028 evaluation reports of nine international organizations between 2012 and 2020 to calculate a performance score. We present descriptive statistics and argue that the novel data set offers a solid conceptual and empirical basis for studying IO performance as well as the content of IO evaluations, allowing us to compare them both within IOs (over time, across projects or countries) as well as between IOs.

0,"The proposed paper seeks to build and use a framework for analysis of strategies and marketing tools of political crises. The approach is based on the grounds that political marketing of a government is not targeted exclusively on the crisis, but instead is perceived as a broader political marketing strategy of a political organization/party in the context of political competition and elections. The proposed approach revisits the role and tools of political marketing of political organizations in the view of a post-pandemic era.
The research framework is presented through case studies focusing on the marketing strategy and communication management of the COVID-19 pandemic in the cases of Albania, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Greece, Kosovo, Romania, Republic of Serbia, and Turkey. From March 2020 until the time the present chapter is written, the events and evolution of the pandemic is still ongoing.
In this case, a government can articulate its strategy, which essentially includes all perceptions, interpretations and actions, guided by its principles, interests and political positions, implementing on of the following three structural axes: treating the crisis as an opportunity, as a threat, or without recognizing its very existence. These communication strategies are intertwined with the processes of creating a meaning, which is triggered by the crisis itself almost automatically and takes place in a political context in which political issues of seriousness, causation, responsibility and accountability are raised. 
It is obvious that a crisis, such as a pandemic, requires a coherent strategy of communicating a message and conveying all the ""outputs"" from the government through the latter. In the opposite scenario, the concept of competition in political marketing is placed in a context of anarchic conception.
The suggested approach perceives crisis not necessarily as an out of the ordinary phenomenon, but rather as part of the normal flow of political marketing of an elected government. The paper offers a tool for further use in the analysis of the results of the management during the pandemic and the subsequent assessment of the government’s response in the future and whether the strategies used, contributed to the successful or not response to the pandemic.",Aristotle University of Thessaloniki,Aristotle University of Thessaloniki,Aristotle University of Thessaloniki,,,,,,Aristotle University of Thessaloniki,,Theodore Chadjipadelis,Sofia Magopoulou,GEORGIA PANAGIOTIDOU,,,,,,Sofia Magopoulou,,Government,Policy Analysis,Public Policy,Campaign,Communication,Decision Making,National Perspective,,Navigating “the waves”: a framework of analysis of political crisis marketing during COVID-19,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65454&EventID=185
0,"Negativity in political campaigns has been an important concern for both scholars and commentators, and this research has led to a plethora of knowledge. Several studies have found that, while negative campaigns may harm a candidate’s opponent, they may also cause a backlash effect where some citizens seem to abandon their preferred candidate because of their candidate’s use of negative campaign strategies. In either of those situations, it seems that negative campaigning causes citizens to base their vote choice on who not to choose, rather than a positive criterion. In other words, prior research implies – but does not test – that negative campaigning leads to a negative meaning of voting: voting based on keeping candidates or parties out of office, rather than voting them into office. Therefore, (perceptions of) negative campaigns could be correlated with more negative meanings of voting, that may have important political outcomes.

There is, however, increasing evidence that citizens distinguish between negative campaigning – focusing on negative traits or policy preferences of an opponent – and “dirty” campaigning – political attacks that are perceived to transgress social norms, for instance through incivility or unfair campaigning. In other words, certain effects of negative campaigns seem to be induced by a moral judgment of whether the campaign went too far or not. This could mean that the perceived negativity of a campaign is correlated to less liking of the attacked party but not of the attacking party, while the perceived “dirtiness” of a campaign is correlated to less liking of the attacking party, rather than the attacked party. 

So why do parties continue to use “dirty” campaigning? Moral judgments about campaigns are likely to depend on both the attack itself and whether it is performed by a party or candidate with which someone identifies (in-party) or a party or candidate with which someone does not identify (out-party). Therefore, we expect that both negative and “dirty” campaigns are more likely to be perceived as “negative” for the in-party and “dirty” for the out-party. Therefore, the backlash effect of “dirty” campaigning on liking the attacking party might mostly be driven by those who did not like them to begin with.

I test these expectations in two settings. First, I explore the real-life situation in a cross-sectional study of the correlations between perceptions of negative and dirty campaigning, citizens’ meanings of voting, and attitudes towards political parties. To validate and extend the results, I will conduct a 3 (control/negative /dirty), by 2 (attacking party/candidate) survey experiment. In this experiment, participants will be exposed to manipulated political advertisements, in order to complement the real-life effects of the cross-sectional data in a controlled campaign environment. All data will be collected in March 2022, during the campaign for the legislative elections in Hungary (N = 2000). 

The findings will help us clarify why negative campaigns have certain effects and enable us to further explore their influence on voting, elections, and democracy.",University of Vienna,,,,,,,,University of Vienna,,Ming Boyer,,,,,,,,Ming Boyer,,Political Psychology,Voting,Campaign,Electoral Behaviour,Survey Experiments,Survey Research,,,"Negative campaigns, negative votes?

0,"Based on interviews and trajectories of female student activists in Egyptian universities, this paper analyzes how engaging in a student organization, be it an explicitly political one like an activist group or a partisan organization, or a less politicized one such as simulation games (such as Model United Nations), initiates a negotiation not only of traditional gender roles in activism but also of the dominant norms of femininity and patriarchal expectations from women. I call it negotiation as, while the literature on the Middle East focuses on drastic visible challenges to the patriarchy such as the political expression through naked female bodies, in the trajectories observed, the challenge is more subtle, and rather than an explicit rupture it takes the form of negotiating of the restrictions imposed on young women. 
This negotiation can take different manifestations. For example, for Basma, in order to be able to participate with an activist group in her university, she needed to negotiate the curfew imposed by her parents to return home before a certain hour. For others it can be even a more subtle pushing of boundaries such as Mariam who, with her colleagues from the political party, started feeling comfortable frequenting public cafés which are typically male dominated spaces.  For some the challenge can focus on bodily norms and expectations of clothing and appearance, such as Sara whose engagement in the student union in her faculty was so time consuming to the point that reports a “complete change of wardrobe” to wear comfortable and practical clothing, and Riham who found that since she started engaging at the MUN, she has become “more serious” and started to “develop interests beyond what color to dye my hair this month”, perceived by her as a typically mundane female interest.
At the intersection of the biographical impact of activism and the study political activism and gender roles, this paper aims to emphasize the role of activist groups in the politicization of such negotiation of norms. Even though in all cases, the change is attributed to the experience of engagement, women who were part of explicitly political student groups were more likely to frame their challenge in political terms such as Basma who describes her negotiation of the curfew as a “struggle” and rebellion, and situates her own trajectory as part of a broader problem in society. In such cases, the negotiation of gender norms can also be a negotiation of new ways to politicize one’s life and choices.",European University Institute,,,,,,,,European University Institute,,Farah Ramzy,,,,,,,,Farah Ramzy,,Contentious Politics,Gender,Social Movements,Mobilisation,Political Engagement,Activism,Youth,,Negotiating politics and gender norms: Student activists in Egyptian universities,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64182&EventID=185
0,"Incels (“involuntary celibates”) are an online milieu predominantly comprising young men who have constructed an identity around an inability to form sexual relationships with women. Beliefs about the exact cause of this “inceldom” differ from community to community, and in many cases, person to person, although they are broadly aligned by an opposition to feminism, concern over the issue of “lookism” (the idea that less attractive people are discriminated against), and a belief in a rigidly defined “sexual marketplace”, which is understood to favour women over men.

On August 12th 2021 in Plymouth, UK, a violent attack left five dead. The shooter, Jake Davison, is generally understood to have been active in a number of incel communities, and to have used incel terminology in videos and messages he posted online prior to the event. We investigate posts from three prominent incel forums (Incels.is, Lookism.com, Blackpill.club) in the days following the attack. Using critical discourse analysis on the threads about the attack, we explore how it is discussed, the extent to which acts of incel violence are endorsed by incels, and how inceldom is constructed in the discussions about violence.

Although incels are commonly portrayed as supporters of violence, our results suggest the reality is more complex. There is no clear consensus in the discussions on whether this was an incel attack, and whether the violence was justified.

When violence is portrayed positively in the discussions, it is often justified as something the society at large has earned by ignoring the incels’ suffering, or as a wake-up call to make others realise the direness of their situation. Incels are constructed as victims, and violence is justified as a natural, logical consequence resulting from inceldom, shifting blame away from the attacker and the incel community and portraying them as victims of circumstances. However, many discussants categorically condemn all violence as morally unacceptable and challenge others for justifying it. Many argue against mass violence because it makes the reputation of incels, already poor, even worse. These posts often anticipate increased surveillance of incels communities following the attack, as well as vaguely defined “new laws” that will be introduced to further oppress incels.

Finally, the attacker’s appearance is a significant topic of interest in the discussions, and the source of much disagreement. A rigid logic which stresses the importance of appearance is an integral part of the incel ‘blackpill’ ideology, which draws heavily from interpretations of evolutionary psychology. Davisons appearance is important for informing how discussants understand inceldom and victimhood, and how they rationalise violence. It is also important for understanding whether Davison himself was actually an incel, as many estimate the attacker’s appearance to be better than a ‘true’ incel’s. His appearance is invoked in a variety of arguments, and is often used to draw contradictory conclusions, demonstrating the ideological elasticity of this worldview which is often purported by its adherents to be scientific and objective.",University of Helsinki,Dublin City University,,,,,,,University of Helsinki,,Emilia Lounela,Shane Murphy,,,,,,,Emilia Lounela,,Extremism,Gender,Political Violence,Identity,Internet,Qualitative,,,Negotiating violence in incel online discussions of the Plymouth shooting,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64702&EventID=185
0,"Democratic theorists have long argued that some form of global democracy is needed to close the gap between “rule-makers” and “rule-takers” in global governance and legitimize global decision-making. Some, such as Daniele Archibugi and David Held, have gone so far as to propose a democratically elected world assembly. 

Yet a persistent criticism of global democracy is that a functioning democracy requires solidarity or a shared identity amongst its participants. Without trust, mutual concern and what David Miller calls “sympathetic identification”, talk of global democracy is at best premature and at worse dangerous. The basis for solidarity or shared identity of the relevant kind is often construed as a shared culture, which does not exist at the global level. Therefore, advocates of this view tend to suggest more conservative ways to improve global governance such as relying on existing international law and treaties as well as NGOs to regulate state behaviour.

In this paper, I turn to Nehru’s writings and speeches on internationalism to suggest a different approach to global democracy, one that neither forecloses its possibility nor denies the importance of solidarity. While Nehru is often known as India’s foremost anticolonial nationalist, lesser known is his lifelong support for what he called a “democratic world union”. As a socialist anti-imperialist, Nehru believed that a democratic world union capable of global redistribution and co-ordination was the only hope for addressing the root causes of imperialism. To this end, he also thought that a global solidarity was essential. But Nehru offered a different diagnosis of the difficulty in attaining such solidarity. For him, the primary obstacle was not cultural pluralism but persistent subordination of historically oppressed populations within a global political hierarchy. As long as international law and organizations remained instruments of the powerful for subordinating others, “narrow nationalism[s]” would only grow stronger and undermine the emergence of a cosmopolitan solidarity. 

These claims are grounded in Nehru’s experiences in the Indian anticolonial struggle, during which he witnessed how subordination shapes people’s moral psychology. For Nehru, the primary challenge of building global democracy was cultivating an internationalist outlook among the very agents who had good reason to retreat from global political integration and cooperation. Nehru’s response, in turn, was to foster cosmopolitan solidarity in the very process of contesting one’s subordination. To this end, he worked to internationalize national politics and forge transnational coalitions. 

Drawing from these ideas, I argue for an anticolonial approach to global democracy. I argue that the sceptics’ conservative approach is inadequate to address the problem of global political subordination, while cosmopolitan democrats’ idealist approach is insufficiently attentive to the realities of power that predictably undermine institutions such as world assemblies. Instead, Nehru prompts us to think of a grounded approach to democratizing global governance that emphasizes counterhegemonic political empowerment as an essential tool for resisting subordination while also fostering a cosmopolitan solidarity that paves way for a future global democracy.",University of Oxford,,,,,,,,University of Oxford,,Shuk Ying Chan,,,,,,,,Shuk Ying Chan,,Democracy,Political Theory,Global,,,,,,"Nehru, Internationalism, and World Union: An Anticolonial Approach to Global Democracy",https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63910&EventID=185
0,"Migration policies and practices have generally tended to conceive migrants either as victims in need of protection or as threats to be kept under control. Besides, the classic distinction between refugees and economic migrants that has underpinned the ideation and implementation of such policies and practices has further restricted over time, thus increasingly conceiving the former as bogus claimants and the latter as job stealers or, at worst, as inherently criminals. By employing feminist and decolonial perspectives, the current paper aims at counteracting such discourses both in social and educational settings, exploring alternative ways to conceive of migrants and migration movements. It will do so in three ways. First, it will briefly trace back the process of increasing criminalisation of migration movements and the parallel exacerbation of social and political discourses regarding migration, in order to provide a broad historical overview of the current situation. Second, it will critically look at how such restrictive policies and practices have produced social and legal divisions among migrants, dividing them along lines of class, race, and gender. Third, it will explore the role of educational practices in critically analysing these social divisions through an intersectional lens and potentially counteract and overcome the dominant discourses on migration.",University of Vienna,,,,,,,,University of Vienna,,Marco Mogiani,,,,,,,,Marco Mogiani,,Gender,Migration,Education,,,,,,Neither victims nor threats: Challenging traditional representations of migrants in societal and educational contexts,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64584&EventID=185
0,"Network governance is often described as a compromise to deal with the international governance dilemma between a growing need of collective action and the preserved importance of national sovereignty. This dilemma features prominently in EU policy implementation as well. Here, European Administrative Networks (EANs) fulfil a crucial role in the implementation and enforcement of EU law and facilitate collaboration among national civil servants across the European Union. However, without a clear or fixed hierarchy, such horizontal governance structures may come with their own vulnerabilities. This study explores the durability of such networks and tests the resilience of the key cross-border problem-solving network for the enforcement of internal market rules: SOLVIT. In the past years, SOLVIT has faced two exogenous shocks to its system: the exit of a key player (Brexit) and the uncertainty and challenges posed on the internal market by a global pandemic (COVID-19). Based on unique three-wave survey data on SOLVIT’s network interactions, we develop a continuous-time model (SAOM) to analyse the network evolution during these crises. We test how both crises have affected interactions among SOLVIT centres for general discussions, exchange of views or informal advice on SOLVIT-related matters. Our preliminary results show that the network is remarkably resilient and despite, or rather because of, these shocks, has become denser over time.",Radboud Universiteit Nijmegen,University of Copenhagen,Radboud Universiteit Nijmegen,,,,,,Radboud Universiteit Nijmegen,,Reini Schrama,Dorte Sindbjerg Martinsen,Ellen Mastenbroek,,,,,,Reini Schrama,,European Politics,European Union,Governance,,,,,,"Network governance, vulnerable or resilient?

0,"Political contention has reached several peaks in recent decades in Europe, from anti-austerity protests, the “Summer of Migration”, financial crises, up to the recent protests around counter-measures against the COVID pandemic. This has even led scholars to speak of a Social Movement Society, in which political interest articulation through means of protest has become a routine form of engagement. At the same time, so-called Movement Parties are a (re-)emerging phenomenon in the European party landscape that has attracted increasing scholarly attention in recent years. They are characterized by either emerging from or aligning themselves with street protests and hence bridging the arenas of institutionalized politics and protest. Examples include the much-discussed Movimento Cinque Stelle  (Five Star Movement) in Italy, or lesser-known cases like the Uniunea Salvați România (Save Romania Union), or the Danish Alternativet (The Alternative). Movement parties not only differ in their political ideology and their stance on populism but also in their electoral success and failure within and across countries. Unfortunately, much scholarship has focused on single cases or relied on anecdotal evidence and political manifestos to characterize movement parties as distinct from other, more traditional forms of party organization. Thus, much reasoning on movement parties and their position at the intersection of the institutional arena and the protest arena still lacks systematic empirical investigation, especially from a cross-country perspective.
Our paper closes that research gap by analyzing ties between movement parties and contentious collective actors in six countries. We argue that social media platforms are a key venue for parties' interaction with civil society organizations and hence provide a good proxy of the communication strategies of political parties, particularly in reference to contentious non-electoral politics. Therefore, we employ a multi-step strategy of data collection and analysis. First, we collect all available Facebook posts and Tweets from two ideologically different movement parties' official channels for each country between 2015 and 2021. Second, we use quantitative content analysis to identify protest-related content in the movement parties' official Twitter and Facebook communication. Third, we inspect these messages and identify accounts and hashtags related to these protests. Fourth, we add these to our data collection. Finally, we conduct a social network analysis of movement parties' and civil society organizations' digital ties (e.g. @mentions, linking patters, use of hashtags, or free-text references). This analysis allows us to explore the (mutual) connections of contentious actors and political parties, hence answering what networks emerge from the digital interaction of movement parties and civil society, what position movement parties hold in these networks, and what variations appear across countries, time, and political ideology.",University of Copenhagen,University of Copenhagen,,,,,,,University of Copenhagen,,Matthias Hoffmann,Christina Neumayer,,,,,,,Matthias Hoffmann,,Political Parties,Social Movements,Social Media,,,,,,Networks of institutions and protests: A cross-country analysis of social media linkages between movement parties and social movements,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65091&EventID=185
0,"The paper examines minority non-profit organizations and their interorganizational relationships in three localities. Kosice (Slovakia), Pécs (Hungary) and Timisoara (Romania) have been selected because of their multiethnic character: each city gives home to multiple minority communities, which maintain various types of institutions to achieve their specific goals and meet their needs. While Košice and Timisoara give home to one relatively larger minority (Hungarian in both cases) and several smaller (German, Roma, etc.), Pécs is the home of three communities of comparable sizes (Croat, German and Roma), and some smaller. The multi-ethnic character of the studied cities makes it possible to examine the minority organizational networks side by side, and thus to see their interconnection or mutual isolation, and to compare the structure of the networks of different minorities. 
The paper is based on primary interview and survey data collection, and presents the minority institutional networks of these three county seats: the main characteristics of the minority non-profit organizations, their conditions of operation and interoganizational relationships. The first wave was conducted in 2017, and the cities will be revisited for a second wave in first half of 2022. Exchange of information, cooperation, support ties, overlapping membership, ties of esteem, and perceived influence were studied. The study of negative ties was unsuccessful due to respondents’ unwillingness to name such contacts. 
The first wave of survey found that while interethnic ties are not completely absent, most organizations prefer ties with organizations belonging to the same minority. This was not only true for larger minorities that have plenty of opportunity for homophilic ties, but also smaller minorities. Homophily was extremely strong in the case of all types of ties except ties of esteem and perceived influence, which make it possible to study, how the local minority insitutional systems are perceived from the outside by the other minorities. The degree of concentration is relatively high in the networks, which tend to form with influential and relatively professionalized “public institutions disguised as NPOs” (cf. Kiss 2006) in the center with smaller CSOs on the semi-periphery and periphery. Subcultural/communitarian mode of coordination of collective action (cf. Diani 2015) proved to be the dominant.

0,"The presentation will focus on two long standing concepts included in the ISSP National Identity module. First is the general national pride question battery which includes questions which are one of the most frequently used in the ISSP National Identity module. The majority of authors who analyse these questions see them as measurements of nationalism. However, as was argued recently these measures make international comparison of nationalism problematic, as they tend to suffer from two issues: a) they tend to measure also the perception of general affluence / living standard of a country. E.g. agreeing with “Generally speaking, Switzerland is a better country than most other countries.” does not necessarily imply nationalistic leanings. b) Answers to the questions are influenced by political sympathies the respondent has towards the current government. As was demonstrated, regardless of ideology of the ruling party, people who support a party in the current government also score higher on the nationalism index calculated from the ISSP general national pride items. Part of the problem with this contextuality is the focus of the questions on what can be identified as quotidian concepts of nationalism or nationalism in political practice which are only two of four conceptions of nationalism. At the same time the questions fail to measure support for nationalism as a political ideology which is the latent variable behind other understandings of nationalism. Therefore a set of alternative questions focusing on support for nationalism as an ideology have been introduced in the pre-test. The results show that these new questions provide less context-dependency in measuring nationalism and are better connected to related topics such as xenophobia, aggressive foreign policy or isolationism. The second focus of the presentations is the measurement of the civic-ethnic dichotomy which is also one of the most used question batteries from the ISSP National Identity module. While popular, several authors struggle with assigning individual items to either civic or ethnic definitions of a nation. Even if some authors arrive empirically at an seemingly universal, stable and acceptable assignment of the individual items to civic or ethnic definitions of the nation, doing the same analysis for individual countries reveals that this division is neither stable not universal. Similarly as in the case of measuring nationalism, the problem is the changing contexts in which respondents provide their answers. The person aspiring to become a true [nationality] can by a migrant (in the western countries), it can be a diaspora member (e.g. Hungary, Ireland) or a member of an autochthonous minority (e.g. Slovakia, Spain). Moreover, these contexts can change also over time. The pre-test explores if this problem could be avoided if a simple contrast between becoming a [NATIONALITY] and being born a [NATIONALITY] is offered to the respondent. Based on the pre-test results, we demonstrate, that respondents tending to see nationality as an ascriptive characteristic tend to have more xenophobic views than respondents who side with the option that it is possible to become a particular nationality without being born as one.","Institute for Sociology, Slovak Academy of Sciences",,,,,,,,"Institute for Sociology, Slovak Academy of Sciences",,Miloslav Bahna,,,,,,,,Miloslav Bahna,,National Identity,Nationalism,Populism,National Perspective,,,,,New approaches to measuring central concepts in the study of nationalism: Pre-test results from four countries,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64296&EventID=185
0,"Non-state actors are participating in a range of policy-making arenas within the EU and other governing bodies at the local, regional and global levels of politics. The overarching goal of the paper is to analyze the respective access to, and influence of, a range of interest groups in policy-making in the European Union in the COVID-19 times. In particular, the paper will explore unevenness in the influence of particular types of non-state actors in policy-making processes at the begging of governance from 2020 when the Pandemic was started in the Global order and in the European Union.

Expanding regulation and access opportunities after the breakpoint of COVID-19 times was limited which has a significant impact on relationships within EU institutions and other governmental authorities at the national level. Lobbying in general promotes a variety of forms, means of communication and exchange of views, which are fundamental for enabling different non-state actor’s activity. After 2020 there are wide divergences in representation and access to the policy-making process for interest groups which influences the efficiency and effectiveness of actions taken by this groups. Indeed, interest groups influence is dynamic and often depends on the consultation processes at the EU and at other governing institutions in Europe. The degree of balance among the different level of cooperation in regard to representation and access to particular institutions is also dependent on the economic, legal and social context of policy-making in the COVID-19 times.

The paper will present goals of interest groups as part of the European Union decision-making process as well as the new forms of influence used by interest groups in the EU decision-making process empowered in Pandemic times. The main research objective is to analyze the cooperation of interest groups with individual institutions and bodies of the European Union, the role of interest groups in shaping European policies, the forms of interest group influence that are important in the decision-making process in the EU in Pandemic COVID-19. The following problems are addressed in the paper: institutional prioritization within the model of how interest groups function in the EU, the role of interest groups within the interest representation in creating European Union policies and how to define the new forms and channel of influence of interest groups in the EU in Pandemic. The following research questions are posed in the paper: which EU institutions are relevant from the point of view of interest groups and why in the Pandemic times? Which institutions are more important than others and what is the result of such a situation? What is the role of interest groups in the creation of European Union policies in Pandemic times? What forms of influence can be used in lobbying campaigns by interest groups in the Pandemic times? Are there any complementary new forms of influence?

0,"Over the last years, resilience has become a central concept in social science research of societal transitions and governance dynamics. In the context of European Union politics, resilience has, for instance, already been studied as a contested policy paradigm for EU external relations (Joseph & Juncos 2019). At the same time, a comparable analysis of what resilience ‘means’ as a policy norm for EU internal governance is still due. Recently, however, the Covid-19 pandemic has further stipulated the need for such stock-taking. The European Union’s policy response embodied an ideational reconfiguration within the overall EU governance architecture and sectoral strategies. Most noteworthy, the concept of resilience has become relatively more visible as a norm within the policy discourse as opposed to norms relating to competitiveness and growth (see Felder & Stockmann, forthcoming). This exploration leads to asking whether this reconfiguration entails a paradigmatic shift or if neoliberal benchmarks of EU governance are perpetuated in ‘new bottles’ with the label of resilience.

In this contribution, we respond to this question with a qualitative-interpretative assessment of the meaning of resilience in internal EU governance. To situate this study, we review the conceptual, political science literature on resilience and carve out links to the area of internal EU policymaking and governance. Taking this operationalization as a baseline, we present results from an analysis of expert interviews with EU officials and core EU policy documents. We demonstrate that different knowledge reservoirs and conceptual understandings exist regarding resilience between different EU actors and within organizational fields. This effectuates a contested usage and meaning of the concept within EU strategies. Therefore, we conclude that resilience must be understood as an ‘empty’ concept in which practical usage is subject to political power dynamics and regulation.",Universität St Gallen,Westfälische Wilhelms-Universität Münster,,,,,,,Westfälische Wilhelms-Universität Münster,,Alina Jasmin Felder,Nils Stockmann,,,,,,,Nils Stockmann,,European Union,Governance,Political Sociology,Constructivism,Policy Change,Power,,,New paradigm or old wine?

0,"New parties in government are a recurring phenomenon in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe (CEE). They often direct their electoral strategies against mainstream parties and enter governments on the promise of ambitious reforms related to good governance, fighting corruption, and other pressing issues. While the electoral success and parliamentary survival of new parties in CEE has received considerable scholarly attention, we know comparatively less about how these parties affect coalition governance. This paper explores the parliamentary agenda-setting behavior and legislative success of cabinets with new parties. Specifically, it argues that new parties face a twofold challenge when entering a cabinet. First, due to low organizational capacity, weak parliamentary cohesion and relatively inexperienced personnel, new parties generally have lower policy-making and bargaining capacity compared to established parties. Second, entering a cabinet usually entails moderation of their policy stances, while at the same time, new parties need to maintain the status of an outsider to mainstream politics. These challenges are expected to affect the legislative agenda-setting and success of new parties and their coalition partners. Regarding the agenda-setting, ministers from new parties may therefore initiate their bills later in the term compared to ministers from established parties. After bill initiation, new parties may perform more rigorous scrutiny of coalition partners’ legislation, particularly on the issues salient in their electoral campaigns. The paper tests these expectations on the data set of government bills in Czech Republic and Slovenia between 2008 and 2018. The results of this study contribute to the debate on party system stability and policy innovation in CEE, and may motivate research into other governance strategies of new parties in the region and beyond.",Helmut-Schmidt-University/University of the Armed Forces Hamburg,,,,,,,,Helmut-Schmidt-University/University of the Armed Forces Hamburg,,Marko Kukec,,,,,,,,Marko Kukec,,Europe (Central and Eastern),Comparative Politics,Executives,Parliaments,Political Parties,Coalition,,,New Parties and Law-Making: Evidence from Central and Eastern Europe,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63420&EventID=185

0,"My paper aims to reconstruct and justify, with the help of the conceptual tools provided by Weber and Habermas, the central position of the constitution-making process that establishes the governmental institutions of political communities, with a focus on the EU democratisation. The legal-institutional integration determines the structure of democratic society, providing an answer to the questions of how legitimate norms can be produced and how legitimacy can be brought out from legality within a politically autonomous community. Looking closely at current political evolution, we must pay attention to the following question: ""what democratic form has the EU taken and can it take?"". From this perspective the integrative emerges the relevance of two processes: 1) the EU constitutionalism as a symbolic solidarity moment with which the European integration can enter into the collective consciousness of European society (""integration by constitutions""); 2) the prominence of the European Parliament as the institution that pursues European solidarity through the EU democratic principle (Articles 9-10 TEU), binding every national individual to European citizenship and representing him directly at EU level.
An approach based on the comparative study of (European) Constitutional law, case-law of ECJ and national Constitutional Courts allows explaining that these two processes are closely linked, developing and reinforcing each other, building ""an ever closer union among the peoples of Europe"" that goes beyond the idea of the European Economic Community (economic integration): the constant transition from international treaties (relating to the economic sphere) to the attempt of a European constitution and the subsequent treaties produced the transition from a Parliament composed of national delegates (with a censure-motion power on the Commission) to a directly-elected Parliament with broad powers that the process of constitutionalization (legal-institutional integration). European integration, primarily focused on economic integration, only secondarily pursued the legal-institutional integration. This perspective allows us to criticize its prevalent theoretical framework: European integration cannot be driven by economic cooperation, but the latter must undergo institutional-legal integration. The European Parliament should therefore restrict the ever stronger technocratic claims of the Commission, the European Council, the ECJ, and the ECB, reinforcing its position as locus of European political problem-solving. The pandemic crisis is showing the formal European 'path-dependent' paradigm: an executive self-authorization combined with a legislative disempowerment, both at the national and the European level. If, from a functional viewpoint, European solidarity was the only measure needed to deal with a symmetrical shock, from a normative viewpoint we are witnessing a lack of democratic-parliamentary participation. The European policy shift cannot refer to a politics that prioritizes technocratic aspects over effective citizen participation in the name of the urgency of the problems to be addressed. What distinguishes demo(i)cratic politics from other types of politics is how decisions are formed and implemented, beyond their actual content. The match between the demands of the European Parliament and the proposals of the European Commission and the European Council is merely contingent, not structural. But democracy requires a strong structural link between policies (the “content”) and politics (the “how”).",Universitat Pompeu Fabra,,,,,,,,Universitat Pompeu Fabra,,Nicola Abate,,,,,,,,Nicola Abate,,Constitutions,Democratisation,European Union,Integration,Parliaments,Political Theory,Normative Theory,Demoicracy,New policies but old politics: the pandemic and our democratic future,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63334&EventID=185
0,"In Poland, after the political transformation after 1989, doctoral education remained outside the mainstream of public policy interest for many years. The 2018 reform is the first major change in the systemic approach to education at the doctoral level, which, however, is part of the avant-garde of changes in Europe. Significant deregulation at the national level has been associated with much higher requirements for conducting doctoral education and the need for its new organization not around organizational units, but within doctoral schools. The decrease in the number of educated doctoral students is the expected goal of the changes made, as is the improvement of the quality and effectiveness of PhD education. For the first time in history, doctoral student education will be subject to a real external evaluation of its quality, too. A significant change is the legal status of doctoral candidates, bringing them closer to the category of young scientists (researchers) than third-cycle students. The 2018 Act, specifying only the general rules for the organization of doctoral student education, left universities (and other institutions authorized to educate doctoral students) a great deal of freedom in terms of arrangements for the organization of doctoral schools (and the universities themselves). As a result, we have a large variety of structural solutions and management models. The education of doctoral candidates is also influenced by the new rules of scientific evaluation and the instability of rules in this area; financing of the science and higher education sector and first experience in conducting doctoral schools.

The developed civil society is structurally considered as one of the indicators of development of democracy in the state. The effectiveness degree of forms and mechanisms of civil society structures participation in the making and implementation of state decisions indicates the openness level of the political-administrative process. The answer to the question about how civil society structures participate in the development and implementation of a political course, as well as about how the relations between civil society structures and authorities develop in various fields of politics, we will be able to assess to a certain extent the level of democracy of the political system in a state.
The paper analyzes the Russian NGOs involvement level in the development and social policy implementation at the local and national level. It identifies key areas, tools, opportunities, and obstacles to the civil society structures participation in the political process. The article is aimed at researchers interested in the development of democracy, participation of civil society institutions in the political process, comparative analysis of the third sector organization under different political, social and cultural conditions.
This research is important for identifying opportunities for the democratic institutions functioning and the use of civil society tools in the political process under conditions of different types of political systems and in situations of political and social instability and crisis.
NGOs in Russia operate as social benefits providers and services to various groups of the population (primarily vulnerable social groups). Therefore, it is important to consider their activities as actors of social policy. In this process, NGOs perform three functions: 1) promotion of political and social interests of various social groups, 2) reforming the field of social support, development and implementation of new effective social technologies at the level of state structures, 3) initiation and lobbying of changes in legislation in the field of social policy.
One of the most relevant questions is how the relations between the authorities and NGOs are built in the sphere of social policy formation under the conditions of modern regulatory and legal framework and existing political and social processes and contradictions. The paper considers various forms of interaction between the authorities and third sector organizations at the local and federal levels. An analysis of the factors that determine the success/failure and effectiveness/ineffectiveness of various forms of interaction in different regions and at the national level is conducted.

0,"One of the most well-established findings in legislative behaviour is that legislative voting behaviour is nearly always strongly structured by coalition-opposition dynamics. In fact, the fixed coalition-opposition dichotomy seems to have become the most important driver for political dynamics. Sometimes even more so than political substance of ideology. 

But what if the demarcation between coalition and opposition parties is removed as the basis setting for local democracy and replaced by a more open set-up? A number of Dutch municipal councils has in recent years attempted to break free of the traditional coalition-opposition dynamic. Instead of a council majority of parties supplying members of the local executive and agreeing on a coalition agreement that sets the agenda of the local executive and binds the coalition partners, these councils work with a council-wide agreement (raadsakkoord). Under such an agreement most or all parties of the council-wide agree on the broad lines of policy and/or the rules and norms under which decisions are made. After the 2018 elections 16% of municipal councils concluded a council-wide agreement. The goal of these council-wide agreements is that there is no demarcated coalition and opposition, which opens the political process up for issue-driven deliberation and voting. The goal of our paper is to test to what extent this is indeed the the case, if this changes voting behaviour, and wether or not this different approach to local politics produces a different political process.

In this paper we will analyze how these council-wide agreements affect legislative voting behaviour. Considering the results of a survey amongst Dutch councilors and case studies we expect that in municipalities with council-wide agreements decisions are more often unanimous, that the average support for proposals is greater (broader?), that differences in voting behaviour are mostly determined by diverging political views rather than whether a party supplies members of the local executive and that parties are more likely to be part of the winning majority, and that the political process is therefore open to actual politics. We examine voting patterns in a representative sample of Dutch municipalities before and after they have implemented a council wide agreement to determine its effect. We also compare voting in a set of municipalities that have such a council wide agreement with a comparable municipalities that do not have such an agreement.

In doing so, our paper adds to the broader literature on legislative behaviour: specifically, whether the dominance of the division between coalition and opposition that we can see in nearly all legislatures in all countries can be diminished through political choice or whether it is an inevitable fact of political life.",Universiteit Leiden,"Departments of Political Science and Public Administration, Universiteit Leiden","Departments of Political Science and Public Administration, Universiteit Leiden",,,,,,"Departments of Political Science and Public Administration, Universiteit Leiden",,Geerten Boogaard,Simon Otjes,Thijs Vos,,,,,,Simon Otjes,,Executives,Local Government,Parliaments,,,,,,"No opposition, no coalition.

0,"The acknowledgement of wrongdoings of an ingroup and suffering of an outgroup is deemed key to reconciliation between ethnic communities involved in a violent conflict. Yet, victims of war are often largely unrecognised. This paper analyses online and offline interactions of ordinary people in relation to the Yugoslav wars to understand what impedes the acknowledgement of war crimes committed by members of one’s own ethnic group. Scholars in social psychology have developed different theories and concepts to explain why people fail to acknowledge such crimes. However, social causes of non-recognition in this context have seldom been tackled. This paper investigates social triggers and argues non-recognition is not only triggered psychologically - by perceived threats to self-esteem, but also socially – by perceived threats to one’s social status at an international level and their symbolic implications. Insights of six focus groups interactions in Serbia and discourse analysis of over 300 tweets and Facebook posts in relation to Yugoslav wars suggest that a fear of stereotyping presents one of the major impediments to the acknowledgement of crimes committed by members of one's own ethnic group.",London School of Economics and Political Science,,,,,,,,London School of Economics and Political Science,,Sanja Vico,,,,,,,,Sanja Vico,,Conflict,Nationalism,Social Media,Transitional justice,,,,,Nomen est omen: stereotyping and war legacy,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63321&EventID=185
0,"In debates on democratic innovations, citizens’ assemblies (CA) are usually categorised as deliberative mini-publics. Clearly, CA exhibit central features of deliberative mini-publics: participants are randomly selected to deliberate on matters of common concern, in spaces that are to some significant extent protected from the power asymmetries and interests that influence deliberations in the parliament and the broader public sphere. However, the description of CA as deliberative institutions is insufficient. A central feature of the British Columbia Citizens’ Assembly and the Irish Citizens’ Assembly, which are often highlighted as rare examples of politically influential CA, is that they were authorised to define the subject matter of a referendum. That competence rendered the CA potential vehicles for political change based on institutional power rather than argumentative power: they not only sought to increase the deliberative quality of public debates by providing thoughtful recommendations, but also influenced a decision-making process that was largely independent of established parliamentary procedures. Based on a review of characteristics of the practices of selected CA, the paper challenges the widespread perception of CA as deliberative democratic innovations and argues that an important quality of CA is their capacity to pluralise political decision-making processes. This shift of perspective enables a more accurate description of current practices of CA and, in addition, can open novel perspectives for a debate on possibilities to further develop the instrument of CA.",Westfälische Wilhelms-Universität Münster,,,,,,,,Westfälische Wilhelms-Universität Münster,,Manon Westphal,,,,,,,,Manon Westphal,,Democracy,Institutions,Political Participation,,,,,,Non-deliberative democratic functions of citizens’ assemblies,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64128&EventID=185
0,"Considering the pandemic as a ‘shock’ or ‘focusing’ event (Kingdon, 1995; Birkland, 1998), this paper examines a key sector that was dramatically impacted during COVID-19: aviation. Lobbying by the aviation industry is significant because airlines and airports were so negatively impacted by unprecedented restrictive policies of governments worldwide, including border closures, mandatory quarantines, and travel bans (Chari and Rozas, 2022, 45, 49, 55). While aviation is usually vulnerable to factors outside of its control such as natural disasters, terror attacks, and oil embargos, COVID-19 resulted in an unprecedented downturn of the sector in terms of reduced capacity and weak demand (Sobieralski, 2020). Airline revenues plummeted (Suau-Sanchez, et al., 2020), with an estimated loss of USD370 billion in 2020 alone (Mazareanu, 2021).

This paper comparatively analyses airline lobbying during COVID-19 in 5 key countries: the US, Canada, New Zealand, Ireland, and Belgium. These countries are chosen given the variation they provide in terms of the economic power of their aviation industries and their competitiveness. The paper uncovers and compares airline lobbying in each state in order  understand the influence of airlines when key decisions were made. It does so by focussing on developments in 2 main policy areas. The first is state aid earmarked to the aviation industry. The second, health and safety policies around flying. The observational period for this paper includes the 18 months from March 2020 to August 2021. 

In order to ascertain the influence of airline lobbying in these policy areas, this paper builds on the extant process tracing literature. We argue that process tracing analysis helps us better understand the new and novel nature of policymaking during the pandemic, which oftentimes witnessed policy decisions driven by public health concerns rather than economic and business concerns. In countries where business interests are usually seen as some of the most powerful players in the policymaking process, their seat at the negotiating table may have been taken by those in the scientific community (Chari & Rozas, 2022, 80). Because pandemic decision-making may have championed the advice and guidance of public health officials over the preferences of economic interests, process tracing allows for greater exploratory analysis to uncover the nuances of the situation and the factors determining the influence of airline lobbying efforts. The type of process tracing analysis we employ has been utilised by interest group scholars in the past (e.g., Michalowitz, 2007; Dür, 2008; Rasmussen, 2015; Crepaz, 2020), but has yet to be used to assess developments in this key economic sector.",Trinity College Dublin,"Department of Political Science, Trinity College Dublin",Trinity College Dublin,,,,,,Trinity College Dublin,,Jack O'Neill,Raj Chari,Lily Rice,,,,,,Jack O'Neill,,Interest Groups,Public Policy,Qualitative,Lobbying,Policy Change,Influence,,,Not flying so high – A comparative analysis of airline lobbying during COVID-19,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63918&EventID=185
0,"As field researchers have increasingly explored the methodological ‘backstage’ of their fieldwork, the importance of the relationship between the researcher and research assistant has come to fore. While the literature has discussed dynamics of gender, coloniality, and exploitation oftentimes inherent to such work arrangements, less has been written about how the relation affects and is affected by situations of vulnerability in the field. In this paper, a research assistant and a researcher come together to address this gap, critically analysing their relationship based on a joint fieldwork experience on the Colombian conflict carried out in 2021. Going beyond the vulnerabilities of the individual persons, we argue that the relation between researcher and research assistant should be conceived as being entangled in situations of vulnerability. To that end, we focus on acceptance in the field and its consequences for the researcher-assistant relation; dynamics of gender, hierarchy, and positionality both within the researcher-assistant relationship and in a hyper-masculine field site; and the support and security that the researcher and assistant depend on or can provide each other with during fieldwork. We show that a conceptualisation of the researcher-assistant relationship as vulnerable allows us to consider the ethics arising from such a work relationship.",Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona,European University Institute,,,,,,,European University Institute,,Laura Ramírez Rodríguez,Wolfgang Minatti,,,,,,,Wolfgang Minatti,,Conflict,Methods,Qualitative,Ethics,Empirical,,,,Of Assistants and Researchers: Vulnerability during Fieldwork on the Colombian Conflict,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65039&EventID=185
0,"Although the political role of bureaucracy in policymaking is rarely contested, bureaucratic influence on policymaking remains an important research gap. This concerns, in particular, the organizational preferences of policy bureaucracies and organizational decision-making in preparation of policy proposals. Looking at the transposition of EU Waste Directives as a most likely case of strong bureaucratic influence, I analyze how lead ministerial departments as policy bureaucracies develop policy proposals: Under what conditions do lead ministerial departments propose permissive or restrictive transposition of EU Directives in a ministerial draft? This paper focuses on organizational decision-making in the lead ministerial department as the potentially most influential and relevant unit of analysis during policy formulation. From a new institutionalist perspective and building on the garbage can model of organizational decision-making, I argue that the policy decision depends on the institutionalization of organizational structure, expertise, and political preferences in the policy bureaucracy as an organization. More specifically, socialization, politicization and professionalization are identified as competing institutional mechanisms of organizational decision-making in policy bureaucracies. I apply fuzzy-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (fsQCA) to study empirically the interaction of these mechanisms in the transposition of EU Waste Directives across EU member states. This cross-case analysis might inform future in-depth within-case studies to understand the consequences of socialization in “bureaucratic silos” on policymaking and to what extent they might be mitigated by politicization and professionalization of the decision-making process.

0,"Recent years have witnessed a heightened disrespect for truthfulness in democratic politics. This development has been generally associated with the rise of populism. Our analysis adds a new dimension in arguing that truthfulness forms an intrinsic part of a working system of representative democracy that not only populism but also technocracy work to undermine. Both overlook how representative democracy both relies on and to some degree promotes an ethic of truthfulness among policy-makers and citizens alike. We shall argue that representative democracy respects the ‘circumstances of truthfulness’ and that it is precisely the competition among parties and the system of representation within a pluralist society that encourages truthfulness. It does so through the very processes of intermediation among citizens and between them and their representatives that both populists and technocrats disparage. We start by exploring the nature of ‘truthfulness’ and why it forms a necessary condition for democratic representation. We then explore how representative democracy requires and promotes an ethics of truthfulness which is promoted by processes of public deliberation and interest mediation by political parties. Finally, we discuss how both populism and technocracy betray the ethic of truthfulness and along the way political equality, freedom and impartiality.",University College London,University of Exeter,University of Exeter,,,,,,University of Exeter,,Richard Bellamy,Sandra Kröger,Sandra Kröger,,,,,,Sandra Kröger,,Democracy,Political Parties,Political Theory,Populism,Representation,Ethics,,,"On populism, technocracy, representative democracy, and truthfulness",https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63199&EventID=185
0,"In contemporary political theory, the idea of epistocracy has again arisen as a challenge to democracy. “Again” because it is, of course, not a novel idea, but rather an interpretation of ideas at least as old as Plato’s ideal of philosopher kings. The underpinning notion is the same: citizens are, in general, too ignorant, too irrational, and too indifferent to make political decisions. Some form of epistocracy – a “rule of the wise” – should replace democracy, to the benefit of all. Not only do individual “bad” voters impose (undue) risk on other citizens, they also act wrongly, per se, when voting badly. This paper examines this latter argument – that individual citizens act morally wrong when voting badly – with the help of virtue ethics. A virtue ethical approach has several advantages when one is to evaluate whether an individual bad voter acts wrongly, irrespective of whether she causes harm. (I have elsewhere established that an individual “bad” voter cannot be said to cause undue risk of harm; the prospect of her vote being “bad” and decisive is simply too small.) More specifically, this paper tests the following epistocratic argument:

P1: You ought not be morally and epistemically viceful when acting
P2: To vote badly, is to act morally and epistemically vicefully
P3: At a certain point, morally and epistemically viceful acting ought to be counteracted
P4: To restrict individual bad voters’ right to vote, is a way to counteract moral and epistemic vicefulness

C1:  At a certain point, morally and epistemically viceful voters’ voting rights ought be restricted

The paper discusses which moral and epistemic virtues and vices are relevant in the context of the voting (section 1); what is meant by “viceful voting” and whether individual voters, in general, can be said to vote vicefully (section 2); and whether voters can act in ways that are so viceful that they justify a restriction of their voting rights (section 3). The paper concludes that although premises 1-3 seem to hold, premise 4 (and therefore the conclusion) is not valid. To restrict individual’s voting rights is not a successful method to counteract viceful voting; rather, it can plausibly lead to less virtuous behavior. Instead of suggesting a restriction of voting rights on virtue ethical grounds, epistocrats would do better in better in proposing ways to enhance moral and epistemic virtues. These findings provide new insight into the debate between epistocrats and democrats, and provides a piece to the puzzle of which political system is most normatively attractive.",University of Gothenburg,,,,,,,,University of Gothenburg,,Sofia Wiman,,,,,,,,Sofia Wiman,,Democracy,Political Theory,Decision Making,Ethics,Normative Theory,,,,On the Epistocratic Challenge to Democracy: The Viceful Voter,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=62185&EventID=185
0,"Sven Hillenkamp has recently formulated an axiom of political practice that grounds the necessity of liberal political thought on the categorical imperative: ""Every camp, every party, every group, and every individual is wrong on essential points!"" Accordingly, in the struggle for freedom and responsibility, the greatest hurdle to common political solutions resides in the fact that we think of ourselves as the good guys and therefore empower us to advocate for certain groups. However, even if one intrinsically wants only the ""good"", forms of paternalism almost inevitably create evil, because our subjective inclinations run counter to the absolute worth of goodwill (Kant 1785, Metaphysics of Morals). 
	In late-modern societies, this problem becomes evident with current conflicts of identity. They represent a central challenge, not least because identity issues are difficult to negotiate for many reasons. For one thing, there is a debate about whether concepts of (collective) identity are at all capable of representing our social reality as well as our diverse group memberships (e.g., Brubaker and Cooper 2000; Jullien 2021). For another, it is assumed, in terms of practical politics, that collective identities determine political and social action. Associated with this, however, are fundamental questions about the (il)legitimacy or (im)possibility of identity politics (Fukuyama 2018; Klein 2020; Meyer 2021). What many contributions have in common here is that they remain entrenched in dichotomous categories and thus indirectly reinforce camp thinking. Here, one’s notions of identity or a good life can only be asserted at the expense of the other. And while the rifts between the camps are deepening (Reckwitz 2020), we are missing a connection that, in our view, is not to be found in relativistic negation but in relational reference.
Kantian thinking is herein the point of departure. The categorical imperative, in whatever form it appears, has, after all, no smaller claim to be the formula of humanity. The human individual as a free and rational being - and nothing beyond is said - must respect other human beings as he does himself. According to Kant's notion of reason, this form of respect is ultimately a ""self-wrought feeling"" (Kant 1785, Metaphysics of Morals) that always includes others. The maxims by which an action can be gauged need to be consistent with the capacity for autonomy. Only in that case, universally valid rules enable the self-determined, i.e. dignified, coexistence of all human beings (law of nature). Contrary to the accusation that enlightened humanism is merely a cloak for securing existing structures of domination or oblivious to power and history (Mills 2017), universalism stands firmly alongside liberal identity politics that are concerned with demanding fundamental rights. On the one hand, humanistic universalism protects us from the empty liberal neutrality that seeks to preserve power structures from within the political center; on the other hand, only relational identity politics based on respect for autonomy can permanently command the legitimacy it claims from others.",University of Rostock / ICU Tokyo,Universität Rostock,,,,,,,University of Rostock / ICU Tokyo,,Dennis Bastian Rudolf,Linda Stiehm,,,,,,,Dennis Bastian Rudolf,,Cleavages,Conflict,Identity,Ethics,Liberalism,,,,On the Possibility and Necessity of Liberal Identity Politics.

0,"Digital technologies are offering a novel environment for political activities and, more specifically, for interactions between citizens and political actors. The literature on these topics is burgeoning (Barbera et al. 2021; Dommett et al. 2021a; Gerbaudo 2018). On the one hand, studies of political communication emphasize the changing nature of election campaigns and the reshaped relationship between leaders and supporters (Schäfer 2021; Dommett and Temple 2018; Chadwick and Stromer-Galley 2016), while on the other hand the literature on political parties examines in more detail the organizational implications of such digital shift (Dommett et al. 2021b; Dommett et al. 2021c). 
Against this backdrop, the paper intends to investigate the opinions and participatory attitudes of party members towards the new digital participation opportunities that their party organizations provide. To do so, we rely on original individual survey data. More specifically, we will use data derived from a survey administered to Democratic Party members in Italy at the beginning of 2022 (about 4,000 respondents). Precisely, we aim at identifying party members profiles according to their (degree of) digital activities, by controlling for variables such as: length of the membership, levels of intra-party activism, evaluation of intra-party democracy. Moreover, we will investigate the changing relationship between members and their party organizations in the new digital ecosystem.",Università degli Studi di Torino,"Dipartimento di Scienze Sociali, Università di Napoli Federico II",,,,,,,Università degli Studi di Torino,,Antonella Seddone,Marco Valbruzzi,,,,,,,Antonella Seddone,,Political Parties,Party Members,Technology,Activism,,,,,"On/off(line), patterns of party membership in digital environments.

0,"Conflicts over the European Union’s core democratic values, especially related to the independence of judiciary, have led to a general trend towards democratic backsliding among its member states. In particular, judicial independence is heavily contested in Poland due to the judicial reforms initiated by its national government that are perceived as undemocratic by the EU. In Spain, the independence bid by the regional government of Catalonia has also triggered wide debates over judicial independence after the national courts declared the referendum illegal, ruling in favour of the Spanish state. But without understanding how these debates are structured and framed in the public sphere, we can understand little about how this most fundamental democratic value has been politicised, whether this value conflict resonates across Europe and why it contributes to the general trend towards democratic backsliding in the EU. Hence, we compare the value conflict over independence of judiciary in Germany, Poland and Spain in print media outlets (around 5,800 articles) as well as on the social media platforms Facebook (around 6,400 posts) and Twitter (around 6,100 tweets) from 2019 to 2021. While Poland and Spain are directly affected by this value conflict and show high levels of engagement by a wide range of actors in both traditional and online public spheres  (large number of politicians of all partisan interests, journalists, academics and experts, ‘digital influencers’ and other political commentators and the general public), Germany is selected to contrast how the value conflict is debated in a non-affected country, which actors participate in the discourse surrounding the debate, if any, and to what extent the German public sphere on the value of independence of judiciary resembles either the Spanish or the Polish public debate. Though the engagement on the value conflict is minimal and involves much less actors who take part in the debate as opposed to Poland and Spain, we find a higher engagement with the value at the EU level as the German public sphere tends to address the ongoing value conflicts in Spain and Poland in the context of EU, more than issues pertaining at the national level. We rely on both manually coded newspaper data as well as social media data in order to analyse the content and the structure of the mediatized value conflict of judicial independence in the public. Further, our comparison of the tone, civility and degree of populism in the public discourses across the three media environments in three different national contexts addresses the scholarly debate on whether social media has contributed to the democratic decline in the European Union.

0,"Do institutional actors influence participation in street protests? During the last years, increasing attention has been paid to the relationship between electoral and non-electoral forms of participation. Political participation beyond the voting booth has become so ubiquitous that some authors have argued that we currently live in a protest or social movement society. Moreover, so-called movement parties, institutional actors with origins in or strong connections to street politics, have received increasing electoral support across (or beyond) the ideological left-right spectrum. In some cases, movement parties have even become governing parties in countries like Germany (Bündnis 90/Die Grünen), Italy (M5S), Romania (USR-PLUS), and Spain (Podemos). Given that non-electoral politics are increasingly important for institutional actors, we ask: does party support influence participation in protest actions? Do certain parties endorse street mobilizations more than others? When parties show support for a contentious episode, does this influence the participation of their supporters?
To answer these questions, we combine survey data and digital media data in three different analytical steps: First, we present data from nationally representative surveys in six countries (Denmark, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Romania, and the UK) on the relationship between party support and participation in several prominent episodes of contention in each country. These surveys collect data about electoral and non-electoral participation patterns between 2015 and 2021. Using regression analyses, we test the effect of different predictors for protest participation, including past and present party support. With that, we test the hypothesis that movement party supporters are more likely to participate in protests. Second, we turn our attention to political parties’ calls for mobilization for said episodes of contention. To do so, we use a combination of automated (dictionary-based) and manual content analyses of parties’ communication on Twitter and Facebook. For that, we collect all tweets and Facebook posts from the official party accounts of the main parties in each country, including movement parties, between 2015 and 2021. We argue that social media platforms are a key venue for parties’ interaction both with their voters and with civil society organizations and hence provide a good proxy of the communication strategies of political parties, particularly in reference to non-electoral politics. Thus, identifying tweets and posts that reference specific episodes of contention allow us to code if, when, and how different political parties refer to specific protests, e.g. through calls for action or critique. Third, we combine these findings with the survey data to test how party support for contentious episodes and individual voting preferences interact in explaining protest participation. We hypothesize that movement party supporters are more likely to participate in protest actions supported by their party but not in other episodes of contention. We expect that this “endorsement effect” is not significant for traditional parties’ supporters. Thus, our paper provides data about the relationship between electoral support and non-electoral participation, as well as political parties’ involvement with non-electoral forms of participation. Moreover, this analysis answers the crucial question of whether party support has an impact on party supporters’ protest participation.",University of Copenhagen,"City, University of London",,,,,,,University of Copenhagen,,Matthias Hoffmann,Felipe G.

With a sample of 242 works (articles, books, and book chapters) collected from different academic repositories using API queries in the R programming interface, LDA probabilistic topic modelling – an unsupervised machine learning approach – is employed in order to a) narrow down the sample selection process, and b) to classify and construct a typology of topics within the literature. This process covers a two-sided problem; delimiting samples and dynamically pre-classifying them. Taking advantage of this methodological complementarity, three overarching research questions are addressed: a) What analytical approaches are identified in the literature? b) How is transparency conceptualised through such analytical approaches? And, c) where has transparency’s focus been placed in relation to an event-process framework? Following Heald’s (2006) event-process framework of transparency, the results of the literature meta-analysis show unequal methodological approaches, topics and issues investigated.

Using the arguments of Hannah Arendt, the article aims to determine what online democracy should look like. It is argued that the internet’s decentralized structure is advantageous because it facilitates the implementation of the Arendtian system of political councils. Clear rules, however, need to be established for such councils to function properly. The article asserts that the rules of political councils should consist of mutual trust, the process of authentication, and the existence of a common world revolving around shared topics. At the same time, however, given the nature of the internet, the article argues that some concessions need to be made in relation to Arendt’s argumentation. This mainly concerns Arendt’s emphasis on essentially political issues.

0,"Online fundraising has remained for a long time virtually absent from party websites in continental European countries. This can be explained by the importance of state funding to political parties across the region. Indeed, research has shown that political parties are more actively engaged in fundraising activities in countries where private sources of income are dominant, such as in the  Anglo-Saxon area. This also holds for the online dimension of political fundraising. 
This paper observes the over-time evolution of online fundraising by political parties in Italy, a country where direct public funding to political parties was recently repealed. Thus, from being among the countries where parties mostly depended on state funds, parties in Italy were forced to turn to alternative sources of income. The Italian case offers an excellent context where to observe the way in which parties adapt to new forms of financing in a growing digital environment. By means of a content analysis of the functionality and design of party websites adapted from coding schemes originally developed by Gibson and Ward and of secondary literature in the field, the analysis will compare the evolution of fundraising activities (2000-2022) by political parties on their websites and observe if and how online fundraising patterns vary overtime and across parties. 
While empirically focusing on the Italian case, the paper will also provide a comparative discussion on the subject. Indeed, especially following the 2008 financial crisis, various are the European countries that amended laws to reduce the subsidies available to parties, suggesting a diminished state intervention in party financial matters in the coming future. It is therefore reasonable to expect that parties throughout the European continent will adapt and invest in innovative tools for raising money, with the potential added benefit of them reaching out more to citizens.",Università degli Studi di Torino,,,,,,,,Università degli Studi di Torino,,Daniela R.

0,"This paper explores the way collective subjectivities formed online are negotiated and interpreted offline, with a specific focus on how incel (a portmanteau of the words ‘involuntary celibate’) online communities, which are often portrayed in research and public discourse as relatively uniform, are experienced by individuals. 
 

Incel communities are anti-feminist online milieus, predominantly comprising young men who have formed an identity around an inability to form intimate or sexual relationships with women. The phenomenon has links to misogyny, radicalisation and mass violence, and connects to wider anti-feminist movements both on- and offline. Many incels dispute the idea that incels share any kind of ideology and claim inceldom should be understood as a “life situation”, not a worldview. Indeed, it is important to note that incels are a heterogenous group of people from a variety of backgrounds, with differing understandings of both themselves and others. However, incel communities often discuss and promote shared ideas such as the belief that men are being oppressed by feminism, or that unattractive men are discriminated against, especially when seeking a romantic partner.  
 

Inceldom is an identification created and adopted online, but it shapes the way individuals experience and navigate their offline lives. To explore how this identification and the shared ideas and theories of the world are understood and negotiated by individuals participating in incel communities, we use discourse analysis of loosely structured, long-form interviews with both former and current incels. How do they understand and present their position in society both as individuals and as a group, and what kind of experiences do they view as important in their identification as incels? Our preliminary results suggest that self-proclaimed incels’ understanding of inceldom and incel communities vary considerably, as do the life experiences and worldviews presented as inceldom.",Dublin City University,University of Helsinki,,,,,,,Dublin City University,,Shane Murphy,Emilia Lounela,,,,,,,Shane Murphy,,Gender,Social Movements,Identity,Internet,Methods,Qualitative,Men,,Online Identification and Offline Experience: Constructing a Collective Incel Subjectivity,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64763&EventID=185
0,"In the past five years, democratic backsliding and political instability in many middle income countries have begun to put previous success stories of political participation at jeopardy. In the Philippines, for example, democratic backsliding has occurred under the guise of legitimacy during the presidency of Rodrigo Duterte, hardly meeting any serious civil society opposition. In parallel, a global trend towards more online activism and lifestyle politics can be witnessed, especially on sustainability-related issues such as plastic waste or climate change. Online activism and lifestyle politics may function as a gateway or getaway for other forms of institutionalized participation (De Moor/Verhaegen 2020). The growing middle classes in middle income countries may play a key role in both trends, merging online and offline participation – and possibly connection it to the global lifestyle politics trend on sustainability.
This contribution uncovers which modes of political participation are prevalent among the middle classes in Ghana, Peru and the Philippines, including new modes of online participation and lifestyle politics for sustainability. First, we are interested in the shape that online/offline participation takes in terms of socioeconomic group member characteristics.  This will uncover whether clear groups of “slacktivists” only active in online participation exist or whether individuals make use of “participation repertoires” (Oser 2021), constituted of both online and offline participation. Second, we explore the role of political consumption and online activism for environmental reason as factors determining a gateway or getaway for political participation. Political consumption is largely being discussed under the umbrella of lifestyle politics. The line between lifestyle politics as blended form of everyday activism and a mode of political participation of its own right is empirically not clearly drawn yet. Our main contribution to these debates is the provision of much needed empirical data and analysis. 
To analyse middle class participation behaviour, we draw on household surveys conducted with approx. 900 middle class households in each of the capital cities - Accra (Ghana), Lima (Peru) and Manila (Philippines) - in December 2018. We run a latent class analysis (LCA) for each country sample with a range of offline and online participation questions. Subsequently, we run regressions with sociodemographic factors, previous overseas work experience and political consumption as proxies for lifestyle politics to predict class membership. Three of the five identified classes are consistent across the three countries: a disengaged class, an allround activist class and an online activist class. In Peru and the Philippines, a distinct class of helping hands exists, engaged in civic participation; in Ghana, a class of partial activist exists.",German Institute of Development and Sustainability (IDOS),,,,,,,,German Institute of Development and Sustainability (IDOS),,Babette Never,,,,,,,,Babette Never,,Citizenship,Political Participation,Developing World Politics,Internet,Quantitative,Social Media,Political Activism,,"Online/offline participation and lifestyle politics in Ghana, Peru and the Philippines",https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64363&EventID=185
0,"Miloš Zeman's presidency (since 2013) in the Czech Republic was characterised by the rhetoric of the (first) directly elected head of state, which shielded his activism. This activism was particularly evident in the nomination powers, especially in the formation of cabinets, and the appointment or dismissal of ministers. Another frequent area of disagreement was foreign policy. The extremely brief constitutional procedure gave Zeman a lot of room for his interpretation of presidential powers. The president has been only minimally active in the area of presidential vetoes of legislation or complaints to the Constitutional Court. This paper takes a comparative perspective on six cabinets during Zeman's presidency. The main aim is to show the structure of political opportunities that have been favourable to presidential activism and, conversely, the limits that constrained this activism. The paper's initial framework is a discussion of the literature on presidential activism, intra-executive conflicts (Sartori 1997, Frye 2002, Shugart 2005, Protsyk 2005 and 2006, Tavits 2009, Sedelius and Ekman 2010, Elgie, Moestrup, Wu 2011, Sedelius and Mashtaler 2013 etc.) and a summary of the behaviour of Zeman's two indirectly elected predecessors, Václav Havel and Václav Klaus. The contribution of the paper is not only to present the structure of political opportunities and the limits of Zeman's behaviour, but also the changes that the direct election of the president has brought to the relations within the executive power in the Czech Republic.",Masaryk University,,,,,,,,Masaryk University,,Lubomir Kopeček,,,,,,,,Lubomir Kopeček,,Europe (Central and Eastern),Executives,Foreign Policy,Political Parties,Comparative Perspective,,,,Opportunities and limits of presidential activism,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63123&EventID=185
0,"Shortly after the Russo-Ukrainian war broke out in 2014, Ukraine attracted a lot of media attention as foreign fighters coming from extremist milieus travelled to eastern Ukraine to participate in the conflict. In addition, Ukraine was portrayed as a hotspot for far-right tourism: extremists from all around the world travelled to Kiev to attend Asgardsrei, a National Socialist black metal festival. But does this media frenzy accurately reflect the dynamics of far-right mobilization in Ukraine? This article takes a closer look at the far-right movement in Ukraine, its mobilization and repertoires of action, as well as contextual factors that help explain the evolution of the movement over time and its mobilization patterns. The article applies a structural approach within social movement theory that places the far-right movement into its wider environment. It relies on semi-structured expert interviews and an original database of far-right protest events from the onset of the Orange Revolution in 2004 to 2020. The article first looks at how the legal, political, and social context has changed over time, providing varying opportunities for mobilization. Then, it examines how these changes affect far-right protest, defined broadly to include various forms of contentious action, from press conferences to violent attacks. Thus, the article sheds light on how changing opportunities affect protest and its main characteristics, such as frequency, size, target, and level of violence. The paper thus contributes to an emerging literature that studies the far right as a social movement. The aim is to expand scholarship on social movements, which has traditionally focused on left-wing, progressive movements, to include nativist and authoritarian movements. It also aims to expand the literature on the far right, which remains largely party-centred, to include extra-parliamentary actors. In addition, the paper aims to contribute to the study of the far right outside of Western European, consolidated democracies and shed light on mobilization in hybrid regimes, as well as the distinctive context of post-Soviet transition to liberal democracy and market capitalism.",Universitetet i Oslo,,,,,,,,Universitetet i Oslo,,Tamta Gelashvili,,,,,,,,Tamta Gelashvili,,Contentious Politics,Extremism,Activism,,,,,,Opportunities for Far-Right Protest in Ukraine,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63181&EventID=185
0,"Differentiated integration is an increasingly important issue to scholars of European integration. The reasons for this are two-fold: First, differentiated integration is increasingly used to overcome governmental opposition to controversial policy integration. Second, the European Commission has pointed to an increasingly differentiated EU as one possible path forward after Brexit. However, what is missing from the still emerging literature on what drives public support for such differentiation is a deeper understanding of how national identity shapes support for a more differentiated European Union. 

Using data from 2020-21, this paper shows that those supporters of the EU expressing the greatest attachment to their nation-states also express greater support for an EU that is segmented by policy area compared to supporters of the EU with more inclusive national identities. However, they are no more likely than other supporters to want differentiated integration that is only temporal in nature. The reason, this paper argues, is that exclusively national supporters of the EU are more likely than other supporters to see the nation-state as the legitimate centre of political authority and may thus be more worried about what integration implies for national sovereignty. It also finds that these effects are greater in the Nordics and Central and Eastern European countries Denmark and Poland. 

The results have important implications for future paths of integration. They suggest that the kind of differentiation that allows countries to opt out of politically controversial integration may be a useful political tool for allowing the EU to overcome politically controversial integration.  This may, in turn, facilitate even greater degrees of functionally needed integration even in domestically salient policy areas.",Universitetet i Oslo,,,,,,,,Universitetet i Oslo,,Martin Moland,,,,,,,,Martin Moland,,European Union,Differentiation,Public Opinion,,,,,,Opting for opt outs?

0,"Regulatory agencies have limited resources and must carefully choose what they prioritize. However, while there has been a growing scholarly attention on external factors driving organizational attention, such as agencies’ reputations with key audiences, we know much less about the internal mechanisms for how organizations prioritize their activities. This paper aims to open the black box of regulatory agencies to understand their internal dynamics of prioritization. In empirical terms, this study analyses the Norwegian Data Protection Authority (DPA) and its ability to understand, analyse and regulate technology. We compare the organization for learning about technology in the Norwegian DPA before and after the introduction of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). This reform has removed reporting requirements, hence providing more leeway for the DPA to autonomously prioritize activities. We find that changes in agency role have resulted in a massive number of non-conformance reports, which provide in-depth insights into technologies in the market. Simultaneously, the removal of reporting requirements makes it more difficult for the DPA to know how companies process personal data. We use this empirical basis to theorize about attention and learning in regulatory agencies, while also gaining insights into the impact of European Union law-making on the decision-making behaviour of national regulatory agencies.",Universitetet i Oslo,Universitetet i Oslo,,,,,,,Universitetet i Oslo,,Tobias Bach,Jonas Lund-Tønnesen,,,,,,,Jonas Lund-Tønnesen,,Government,Regulation,Decision Making,Technology,,,,,Organizing attention in regulatory agencies: the case of regulating technology,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64053&EventID=185
0,"The pursuit of sustainable development seeks to achieve many different (e.g. economic, ecologic, and social) goals and, along the way, to avoid trade-offs between them. In energy policy, ensuring access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all (UN Sustainable Development Goal Nr. 7) will not only depend on the adoption of appropriate measures in the energy domain, but also in other policy domains. Put differently, energy policy needs to become integrated into other sectoral policies such as environmental policy in order to achieve this goal. However, the concept of energy policy integration remains conceptually underdeveloped and still requires systematic empirical investigation. We seek to advance the state of research by concentrating on the existence and integration of national ministries responsible for energy governance. Specifically, we ask: Which countries have energy ministries in place? What kind of combinations of the energy portfolio with other sectors do exist and how have patterns of portfolio integration in this field changed over time? Finally, how can we explain the existence of energy ministries and their portfolio integration? One strand of literature understands such structural choices as a result of political manoeuvres, where executives seek to frame and reframe issues and signal their policy preferences. Another more functionalist strand emphasises the role of changing external contexts (e.g. economic, technological, social), which are pushing governments to adapt and to increase administrative efficiency. In this paper, we investigate these arguments while taking stock of the energy ministry landscape with a view to policy integration. Empirically, we analyse the existence and portfolio integration of energy ministries in 359 cabinets from 35 advanced democracies between 2000 and 2020. Our analysis relies on descriptive statistics as well as estimation of mixed effects logistic and multinomial logistic regression models. The results show a substantial increase in energy ministries over time and a wide variety of integration choices by different governments. Our regression results moreover suggest that the existence of energy ministries may be better explained by a functionalist perspective whereas ministry integration choices are more related to the policy preferences of governments. These results improve our understanding of the organizational landscape evolving around energy policy and open up discussions about how this may eventually affect policy outputs and outcomes in sustainability transitions.",Technische Universität Darmstadt,Technische Universität Darmstadt,,,,,,,Technische Universität Darmstadt,,Kai Schulze,Mile Mišić,,,,,,,Kai Schulze,,Government,Public Administration,Policy-Making,,,,,,Organizing Energy Policy: Investigating the Spread and Integration of Energy Ministries,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64775&EventID=185
0,"During the 20th century, competition has become one of the most widespread mechanisms for the allocation of research funding in most advanced countries with the institutionalization of competitive grant systems. This “new funding climate” has been fostered by a series of drivers, such as the increase in research costs, the globalization of higher education and the development of what is referred to as “knowledge economy”. In parallel, new policy rationales have diffused, such as New Public Management, which foresaw the adoption in the public sector of management practices derived from the private economy, and in which “competitive” and performance-based allocation of public funds play a central role.
Economic theories tend to consider competition as a given phenomenon that occurs in contexts of high demand for relatively scarce resources. Competition rules are perceived as exogenous to market dynamics. We consider such approaches as problematic for the understanding of competition, as they generally poorly address the social structures and regulatory environment inherent to competitive arenas. Sociological theories of competition focus on how competition is shaped by processes of social interaction within socially-constructed arenas where actors with varying resources seek strategic advantages. However, sociological approaches tend to disregard that competition for research funding comes in a highly regulated environment where the state and/or research funding organizations play a central and asymmetric role as organizers of competition. Such regulatory environments can create, constrain, shape, enable, define, and empower both collective and individual actors. Variations in both the regulatory environments and the social structure of these arenas are expected to deeply influence how competition works, its outcomes and whether it contributes to the achievement of policy goals.
In this paper, we combine elements of both public policy and sociological approaches to advance the understanding of the role of entities organizing competition and the extent to which they are able to shape it considering strategic responses. We will focus on the organization and institutionalization of competition by the European Commission within its European Framework programs for research and innovation (EU-FPs). In the last decades, EU-FPs have been consistently coined into a rhetoric of competition established through rigorous evaluation and high selectivity. Although there is extensive literature on the outcomes of EU-FPs, the very organization and maintenance of this competition remain to be explored.
To this aim, we propose to analyze mechanisms through which public regulation affects competition in public funding; explore how these mechanisms affect the construction of competition as enacted by actors in the field and observe how core dimensions such as scarcity and desire are constructed; and study implications for the outcomes of competition as related also to the intended policy goals. 
We investigate these questions through contrastive case studies of competition within EU-FPs, namely the European Research Council individual grants and collaborative actions addressing topics and so-called “societal challenges” defined by the European Commission.",Università della Svizzera Italiana,Uppsala Universitet,Università della Svizzera italiana,,,,,,Università della Svizzera Italiana,,Marco Cavallaro,Peter Edlund,Benedetto Lepori,,,,,,Marco Cavallaro,,European Union,Knowledge,Higher Education,Policy-Making,,,,,Organizing the competition in public research funding: The case of EU Framework Programs.,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63772&EventID=185
0,"Various forms of misleading information have proliferated on digital media platforms during the COVID-19 pandemic, when news consumption increased substantially. Several studies tackle the effects of exposure to misleading information among the general population and the effectiveness of measures intended to reduce the spread of misleading content. Nevertheless, such studies largely neglect the fact that more informed and educated people are also self-confident and subject to strong third person perceptions about their ability to detect misleading content than less educated ones. In this specific context, the present study investigates some understudied media-related aspects of third person perception about fake news detection, specifically (frequency of) news consumption, trust in the media, belief in conspiracy theories circulating in the media, and diversity of media diet (i.e., how open or closed to opposed views people are). By means of a national survey (N=1006) conducted in Romania in October 2020, we explore the intensity of the third person effect for close and distant others and the role played by both mainstream and online media in this context. Main findings show that frequency of news consumption, trust in the media, and belief in conspiracy theories decrease the perceptual gap between self and others, while education and diversity of the media diet intensifies it. 
Our study suggests that the third person effect about the ability to detect misleading information in the media is particularly important because it might explain why more informed and educated people are sometimes more vulnerable when exposed to misleading information. This vulnerability could be linked to the fact that, by being overconfident in their own ability to detect misleading information, such people no longer question the media content they are exposed to. This could make fact-checkers rather irrelevant in fighting misleading information, in the absence of a coherent and plausible awareness campaign, targeting all the segments of the general population. In other words, such results could offer insights into the sophisticated mechanisms that influence people’s willingness to ultimately check the information they come across in the media. Specifically, they could be useful when designing policy strategies to make fact-checking more successful in reducing the potentially harmful effects of misleading information.",National University of Political Studies and Public Administration,National University of Political Studies and Public Administration,National University of Political Studies and Public Administration,,,,,,National University of Political Studies and Public Administration,,Raluca Buturoiu,Nicoleta Corbu,Denisa Oprea,,,,,,Raluca Buturoiu,,Media,Quantitative,Social Media,Communication,,,,,Others are more vulnerable than me.

0,"As climate targets tighten, all countries must transition towards a renewable electricity. Many different types of power system designs are technically feasible, but there is little knowledge about which type of electricity future citizens prefer. Across Europe, and the world, there is growing public opposition against renewable electricity and power grid projects, indicating that the types of projects planned triggers resistance in the population. Hypothetically, it could therefore be possible to design renewable power systems and adapt them to citizen preferences instead of markets and minimum costs. In this paper, we investigate citizen preferences for a renewable electricity future, conform with the Paris Agreement, through a conjoint analysis among 4.100 individuals in Denmark, Portugal, Poland and Germany, in order to inform planning processes and find higher-acceptance transformation pathways for an either more centralised or decentralised electricity system. To our knowledge, this is the first large-n study systematically investigating citizen preferences for the decarbonisation of electricity systems in different countries, thereby making not only the trade-offs between different aims but also potential conflicts of preferences between European countries visible. We find that electricity costs and self-sufficiency are valued highest across all four countries. We also show that land use requirements are less important to people. This implies that renewable energy infrastructure can receive greater public legitimacy if it is carried out and communicated with direct, explicit links to regional and national energy self-sufficiency and if their potential to reduce electricity costs are emphasised.",Institute for Advanced Sustainability Studies (IASS),Institute for Advanced Sustainability Studies (IASS),ETH Zurich,,,,,,Institute for Advanced Sustainability Studies (IASS),,Franziska Mey,Johan Lilliestam,Tim Tröndle,,,,,,Franziska Mey,,Comparative Perspective,Public Opinion,Survey Research,Energy,,,,,Our voices matter: people’s preference for regional electricity system design,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65019&EventID=185
0,"Neo-Ottomanism as a political ideology has been a major component of the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) in Turkey, particularly since 2007. It is based on the aim to revitalize the glory of the Ottoman Empire in contemporary Turkey with a nationalist and Islamic reinterpretation of history, which is also predominantly patriarchal. Cultural reflections of the ideology have also been widely seen in daily life, popular culture, and media, primarily in TV series and Islamist news media, newspapers, and magazines. Selecting two media fields, TV series and Islamist women’s magazines, this paper discusses the mediatization processes of neo-Ottomanism and its gendered meanings through various representations of history. In addition to presenting their different approaches, the paper examines how these representations are in dialogue with one another and creatively translate, re-interpret, aestheticise or challenge the political messages of neo-Ottomanism for their audience. After discussing the gendered nostalgia in popular Turkish history dramas, the paper focuses on how this ideology is reproduced in three different Islamist women’s magazines with an aim to understand and emphasize the creative agencies of the women editors and authors of the publications in reproducing, aestheticizing, and popularizing neo-Ottomanism. The first set of data about the magazines is obtained from the archive research covering the period 2011-2021. The contents about Ottoman history, culture, and heritage are selected and visually and textually analysed. The second set is composed of interviews with the authors and the editors of the publications about the production process and the dominant themes. This wide range of data shows that references to Ottoman history aim to create a public memory and restorative nostalgia about the pre-Republican past, present Ottoman sultans as role modes, guide the audience in forming identities based on traditional gender roles, and ultimately make a nationalist-Islamist ideology a central part of culture and daily life. This dynamic and creative process also shows that neo-Ottomanism is not a top-down political ideology but a two-way flow of meanings and imageries between the political and cultural spheres.",University of Copenhagen,,,,,,,,University of Copenhagen,,Petek Onur,,,,,,,,Petek Onur,,Gender,Islam,Media,Nationalism,Memory,,,,Out of Politics into the Culture: Mediatizations of Neo-Ottomanism and Gendered Nostalgia in Turkey,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65984&EventID=185
0,"Generalized trust (GT) is a conspicuous double barreled question, with ‘trust in most people’ or ‘being careful’ as extremes. It is used in many studies on ethnic diversity and intergroup relations. While the diversity-trust nexus is often debated, few have focused on systematic response bias in GT. Evidence whether this survey item taps into prejudice or whether it represents a more general measure of trust or risk attitude is lacking. Across two large laboratory studies and two online studies (with Dutch, American and British samples on Prolific), the validity of GT as a proxy for intergroup attitudes (feeling thermometers and preference), implicit prejudice (an adapted Race IAT), or general risk taking is examined. Moreover, I investigate the behavioral validity of GT by assessing its relation to a Trust Game, Social/Digital Distance, and an Investment Task. The lab studies allow the most control over participants’ behavior, while external validity of these findings is confirmed through the online studies. As data collection in the lab started prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, I leverage this source of random variation to investigate the impact of a natural hazard on GT and Social Distance towards out-groups versus in-groups. I limit the samples to the majority white and focus on their attitudes and behavior towards stigmatized minorities – either Dutch Moroccans or British and American Blacks.

Broadly speaking, sociologists would not only analyse exchanges within a regulatory state or multi-level governance system but also changes in state-society relationships. Europeanization is therefore useful as a term that shows the ways in which the EU relates back to pre-existing national societies and/or might even trigger a process of European society building.

0,"Excess weight (i.e., overweight and obesity) is higher among less educated groups, women, ethnic minorities, and in urban areas. Consistent with the intersectionality perspective, excess weight is more frequent in those who experience disadvantages in more than one area of inequity, e.g., women from a low social position. However, greater attention is paid to individual lifestyle factors, recommending behavioural lifestyle shifts rather than addressing social structural and intermediary determinants. Most public policies and interventions have focused on individual lifestyle components, despite evidence revealed that these interventions have a minimal impact and that it is necessary to move the field forward interventions on the contextual social determinants. Mexico is a unique scenario to analyze public policies and interventions to prevent excess weight from an intersectional perspective, given its concomitants features of high prevalence of excess weight (the second highest country in the world, with more than 75% of the adult population with overweight, including 36.1% of obesity), and high degree of social and gender inequality. Previous evidence in Mexico showed that interventions at the individual-level had little impact to prevent excess weight in lower social position groups. On the other hand, population-based strategies, such as the tax on sugar-sweetened beverages, appeared to be beneficial for all population groups, but especially for those at the bottom of the social hierarchy. Intersectionality has emerged as a highly regarded equity-informed tool for analyzing public policy. The Intersectionality-based Policy Analysis (IBPA) framework developed by Hankivsky (2014, https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25492385/) could contribute to identify and address multidimensional inequities and could lead to more effective and responsive policy decisions. The objective of this study is to analyze current nationally adult excess weight prevention public policies and interventions in Mexico, from an intersectionality perspective. Governmental websites, academic papers in English or Spanish, international and non-governmental organizations were searched for current strategies at the national level to prevent excess weight.  Particular attention was paid to the current policies, interventions and actions to prevent adult obesity considered by the Global Obesity Observatory (https://data.worldobesity.org/). A total of 7 public policies and interventions were selected to develop a documental analysis (content analysis). First, the PROGRESS Plus framework was used to systematize the social axis of inequality mentioned in the public policy and intervention documents. PROGRESS is an acronym that aims to represent 8 dimensions of inequalities: place of residence, race/ethnicity, occupation, gender/sex, religion, education, socioeconomic status and social capital.

0,"The fundamental role of democracy is to ensure people’s evaluation of the performance of politicians and political institutions can be enacted via elections. This mechanism ensures that citizens’ views and interests are properly represented in the democratic process. Holding governmental parties electorally accountable is especially important for countries like Hungary and Poland since recent decisions made by Orbán’s and Kaczynski’s governments lead to the politicization of key institutions (Constitutional Tribunal/Court, the judicial system or the parliament itself), which together with puppet presidents of various public bodies have impaired the functioning of horizontal accountability. The impairment of accountability in both Hungary and Poland has been only reinforced by the sudden outbreak of the pandemic. The quickly introduced restrictive measures largely limited one’s freedoms, yet were readily accepted amidst fears of the spread of virus, people endorsing unprecedented policies of restriction as necessary to manage the health crisis. This initial “rallying around the flag” effect enhanced the power of governing parties in most countries, enabling adoption of further authoritarian measures (Guasti 2020, Levine 2020, Weiffen 2020, Changotra et al. 2020). In Poland, government adopted a new law on specific solutions related to the preventing, counteracting and combating COVID-19, which provided more power to the executive at the expense of checks and balances mechanism, while in Hungary the government opted for rule by decree and a prolonged emergency rule, disabling any opposition oversight or institutional control of policies adopted. 
Our paper investigates how pandemic crisis management that can often challenge democratic rule is evaluated in the two most criticized members of the EU – Poland and Hungary. The pandemic is said to contribute to democratic decay, yet we argue slightly differently: we claim (1) the first, immediate effect of the pandemic is to “rally around flag” but since (2) populist illiberal governments adopt authoritarian measures, (3) the ongoing pandemic can bring to the fore populists' failure/ineffective crisis management and thus (4) dissatisfaction can erode public support for the incumbents. Relying on data from public attitude surveys, we examine a number of possible sources of dissatisfaction under the pandemic: healthcare; economy; radical legal steps taken by authorities; and distorted/one-sided communication/false information. We expect citizens dissatisfied with the governing party’s performance in the pandemic should be willing to punish the “guilty” party withdrawing support. Since people evaluate their favorite party in government more positively than non-liked parties, we examine attitudes on the pandemic and its management together with partisanship to assess its role in determining support for the incumbent governments in extraordinary circumstances.",Central European University,SWPS University of Social Sciences and Humanities,,,,,,,Central European University,,Robert Sata,Marta Żerkowska-Balas,,,,,,,Robert Sata,,Political Participation,Political Parties,Populism,Representation,Voting,Quantitative,,,Pandemic accountability in defective democracies,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65380&EventID=185
0,"Crises can be represented and narrated in multiple ways, opening a space of competition and conflict between frames and counter-frames regarding their nature, causes, effects and solutions (Entman 1993; Boin et al. 2017). According to the literature, phases of crisis also constitute a favourable context for the emergence of populist parties. These parties take advantage of the moment of instability and can themselves promote it by proposing polarised and dichotomous representations based on the opposition between victims and perpetrators (Moffitt 2015). Starting from these theoretical premises, the paper aims to investigate how populist parties, holding government and opposition roles, belonging to the right and the left of the political spectrum, have narrated the pandemic crisis with reference to three thematic dimensions: the health crisis, the socio-economic crisis and the european/international relations. To this end, we will compare the narrative frames constructed by the main populist parties in Italy, Spain and France, three of the European democracies firstly affected by the pandemic: the Lega, Vox and the Rassemblement National, as populist radical right parties placed on the opposition side, the Movimento 5 Stelle and La République en Marche, as hybrid populist parties in government, Podemos and La France Insoumise as populist radical left parties, respectively in government and in opposition. Through a qualitative analysis of the speeches delivered by the parties’ leaders and representatives in Parliament between February and October 2020, we will show that the parties adopted different framing strategies (maximization of the crisis; minimization of the crisis; recognition of the crisis) according to their competitive position, while maintaining a populist articulation. At the same time, we will show that the populist articulation is the most visible aspect of parties’ narratives, but it covers a deep ideological differentiation, especially with reference to the economic-social dimension.",università della Calabria,Università della Calabria,University of Calabria,University of Calabria,,,,,università della Calabria,,francesco campolongo,Giulio Citroni,Francesco Maria Scanni,Valeria Tarditi,,,,,francesco campolongo,,Cleavages,Comparative Politics,Political Parties,Populism,Communication,Narratives,,,Pandemic crisis narratives: not only populism,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65124&EventID=185

0,"The current popularity of far-right, authoritarian populism in the United States includes a flourishing popularity of conspiracy theory. Although Trumpism rose several years prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, since 2020 many of the right-wing populist outcries have involved the explicit rejection of vaccination, mask wearing, and other preventive measures, framing them as forms of despotic elite interference. In particular, the issue of vaccination has become contentious and highly politicized throughout the pandemic, with stories touted by QAnon and others placing vaccination as a central pivot around the speculated conspiracies in which various government and scientific elites nefariously cooperate to dominate the populace. The sudden enormous popularity of these suspicions begs for explanation. This paper offers a piece of this explanation, centering specifically on crises of legitimation and epistemology. The exposition here is partly empirical and partly theoretical. For the empirical analysis, a variety of descriptive and inferential findings from the ‘Vaccination, Health, and Values’ survey will be described. The survey was administered over social media in September of 2021, and contains a variety of measures such as the Trust in Science and Scientists Inventory, the Epistemological Style Inventory, Generic Conspiracist Beliefs Scale, a 3-component Populism scale, the Right-Wing Authoritarianism (RWA) scale, and a variation on the World Health’s Organization’s Vaccine Hesitancy Scale. A series of multiple regressions consistently reveal significant associations between populism, right-wing authoritarianism, belief in conspiracy theory, epistemology, and trust in science and scientists. These findings are discussed in relation to a theoretical framework that brings together several concepts that are more typically discussed separately. One of these is the notion of ‘epistemic crisis.’ The use of the term here is especially informed by the writings of Laudan, but is also informed by recent uses of the term that concern the psychosocial effects of social media. As used in this paper, the concept of ‘epistemic crisis’ indicates socially chronic doubt on three connected levels: concerning what is true (‘the what’), how to decide what it true (‘the how’), and who knows or decides the truth (‘the who’). Using QAnon and the COVID-19 health crisis in the United States as the central point of reference, this concept is brought into conversation and synthesis with ideas from Habermas and Hofstadter concerning legitimation crisis, the ‘paranoid style,’ and anti-intellectualism. The epistemic crisis, legitimation crisis, and health crisis are connected elements in what can be understood as a crisis nexus. The crises are useful to discuss as analytically distinct, but they are interrelated culturally and politically, contributing to one another. Epistemic crisis and legitimation crisis meet and mutually activate in the populist distrust of science and scientists, which inspires behavior that contributes to the health crisis. The current popularity of conspiracy theories in the United States occupies this space, where ‘scientific elites’ are not only distrusted but framed as nefarious or corrupt, and there is widespread destabilization concerning ‘the how’ or ‘the who’ that might arbiter competing claims to ‘the what.’",Boston College,,,,,,,,Boston College,,Jeremiah Morelock,,,,,,,,Jeremiah Morelock,,Democracy,USA,Knowledge,,,,,,"Pandemic, Politicization, and Post-truth: Conspiracy Theory and the Crisis Nexus in the United States",https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65813&EventID=185

In doing so, both regulations shape the hierarchy of objectives and the instruments of EU budgetary policies, especially in cohesion policy.

0,"Most federal and quasi-federal systems have at some point been faced with the questioning of the defining features of their constituent units or demands to change the distribution and exercise of powers and responsibilities among the central and regional levels of government. However, whether and the extent to which territorial reform proposals get approved and implemented varies largely over time and across different multilevel systems. Whereas many studies in federalism have focused and tried to explain individual cases of reforms, efforts to comparatively account for processes of territorial reform in multilevel systems are still scarce. To contribute to filling this gap in the literature, the proposed paper aims at building a theoretical proposal on the conditions of feasibility of institutional or constitutional policies across countries; and the theoretical arguments will be mostly illustrated with examples from the reform process of the statutes of autonomy of Spanish autonomous communities According to our explanatory model, some of the main features likely to influence the success or failure of territorial reform proposals are: the contents of the reform and its technical and political viability, the timing and sequence of the reform process, and political competition, including political leadership, as well as country-specific factors such as possible pathologies of constitutional and administrative design.

0,"Parliaments of strangers are assemblies of ‘transient’ and ‘relatively inexperienced legislators. They are the products of legislative turnover ‘hyperinflation’, meaning the mass exodus of incumbent members of parliament from one legislative term to the next. These legislatures exhibit few common behavioural norms and under-developed political skills, little capacity and lack of institutional memory. They can have a huge cost to political development, the stabilisation of democracy and to building the resilience and continuity of democratic. These parliaments of strangers cannot work effectively in holding government to account, developing policy and improving delivery of services to citizens. 

Parliaments in emerging democracies tend to suffer most from high MP turnover with legislative turnover hyperinflation being an endemic problem in many legislatures in Asia, Africa and Latin America. Funding agencies pour large amounts of money into training initiatives for new MPs in these assemblies. From the perspective of donors high turnover rates make the training of MPs a ‘Sisyphean task’. Legislators can only build up the skills to be effective over multiple legislative cycles meaning that a) donor efforts have limited impact within one parliamentary cycle and b) after each election training efforts have ‘to start all over again’. 

From the point of view of political science the widespread presence of these parliaments of strangers in emerging democracies is puzzling. To begin with, many of the background conditions that favour ‘victorious incumbents’ are present in all political systems. Additionally, in many emerging democracies there exists a whole range of institutions that should further facilitate the stability of incumbents via the cultivation of personal votes: weak electoral integrity; sanctioning or even outright ban of opposition parties and candidates; corruption and control over state resources.

It is therefore important to understand what causes the high turnover of MPs in many Asian, African and Latin American parliaments and develop solutions that are evidence-informed. The present paper presents the research design for an internationally comparative longitudinal project with three main objectives: a) map the magnitude of the problem by developing the World Legislator Dataset (WLD); b) understand variability in legislative turnover rates in emerging democracies; c) develop policy evidence informed policy solutions.",University of Exeter,,,,,,,,University of Exeter,,Athanassios Gouglas,,,,,,,,Athanassios Gouglas,,Africa,Asia,Democratisation,Elites,Latin America,Parliaments,,,"Parliaments of strangers.

0,"The increasing public awareness of the threats of climate change have contributed to a new wave of citizen mobilization across the globe pushing for the rapid reduction of carbon emissions. This paper contributes to studies of environmental movements and climate justice demonstrations by investigating what factors that make some individuals to take part in climate protests, while others abstain participation despite their worries about the climate. 

Scholars in political participation and social movement studies are still puzzled about whether it is support for the cause, socio-demographic factors, membership in organizations or social networks, or factors relating to the political environment that primarily explains why people are mobilized to the streets. In this paper, we discuss three types of groups: those being actually mobilized to climate protests, those that are sympathetic to climate protests but do not participate in them, and those that are unsympathetic to climate protests. A comparison of these groups allows us to identify what types of factors that explain individuals’ participation, or non-participation, in climate protests. 

Previous research on protest participation have either used protest survey data or general population surveys. While protest surveys are often focused on specific types of protests (such as climate protests), they say nothing about individuals never showing up for the protest. General population surveys, on the other hand, are good sources of data for comparing participants with non-participants, but almost never ask questions about participation in specific types of protests (such as climate protests), and often generate too few cases of protest participants to make more robust statistical analyses. 

Our approach combines these two types of data, by “pooling” two datasets based on two random and representative samples: one from a public survey to Swedish residents that specifically asks questions about participation in climate strikes (n=1,529), and one from protest surveys conducted at climate strike protests in Sweden (n=929). Both were conducted in 2019. The public survey study targeted Swedish residents living in the three biggest cities (Stockholm, Gothenburg and Malmö) and Sweden at large. The protest survey was carried out in the same cities and followed a systematic random sampling strategy. The pooled dataset contains responses from 2,458 individuals. 

The paper use binary logistic regression analyses to investigate which factors (e.g., socio-demographic, organizational or social network, political ideology) that increase the likelihood of (1) participating compared to not participating in climate protests, (2) participating compared to not participating while still expressing willingness to participate in climate protests, and (3) not participating while still expressing willingness to participate compared to being unsympathetic to climate protests. Our preliminary results indicate that factors shown relevant in previous studies on protests also matters in this study – e.g., socio-demographic, ideological, organizational factors – but also that specific grievances and attitudes related to environmental concerns have a large impact on individuals’ likelihood to take part in climate protests or showing willingness to participate in them.",Lunds Universitet,,Södertörn University,,,,,,Lunds Universitet,,Kajsa Emilsson,Hakan Johansson,Magnus Wennerhag,,,,,,Kajsa Emilsson,Hakan Johansson,Environmental Policy,Political Participation,Social Movements,Climate Change,Activism,,,,Participation and non-participation in climate demonstrations.

0,"Transferability and institutionalization are considered two of the most crucial principles to pursue when designing democratic innovations (Smith, 2009; Gilman, 2016). Participatory budgeting (PB) has shown a high capacity to travel around the world (transferability and diffusion) (Sintomer, et al., 2013). Instead, the PBs survivability (institutionalization) seems to be much weaker (Alves & Allegretti, 2012; Spada, 2014). In this paper we analyse one of the most frequently causes of the instability of PBs mentioned in the literature: ruling party change. To do so, we focus on two research questions: What is the probability of continuity of a PB after the change of local government? Second, does the ideological direction of the government change affect the probability of continuity of a PB? To answer these questions, we rely on an original dataset (in process) composed of 628 Spanish municipalities. In this paper we focus on continuity (136n) and discontinuity cases (95n) of PB (total 231n) in order to find out how ruling party change -after 2019 Spanish municipal elections- has affected their continuity during the current legislature. According to our preliminary results ruling party change or continuity is not an explanatory factor itself but rather its ideological direction.",CSIC – Spanish Research Council / IESA – Institute for Advanced Social Studies,Universidad Autònoma de Madrid – Instituto de Políticas y Bienes Públicos del CSIC,,,,,,,Universidad Autònoma de Madrid – Instituto de Políticas y Bienes Públicos del CSIC,,Isabel Becerril Viera,José Luis Fernández-Martínez,,,,,,,José Luis Fernández-Martínez,,Democracy,Political Participation,Political Parties,,,,,,Participatory Budgeting in Spain and the role of ideology: survivors and victims of the 2019 municipal elections,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64530&EventID=185
0,"This paper investigates the influence of the economic context on partisan policymaking. A focus on how the economic context constrains (or enables) parties’ policy production is of crucial importance especially today, in a period when the global economy is becoming increasingly interconnected and European countries have dealt with (and some are still dealing with) a severe economic crisis. 
Most of the existing literature shows how the political and the party system as well as the related distribution of power in the countries influence parties’ capacities and incentives to promote their policy preferences. At the same time, however, they rarely observe how the macroeconomic conditions in which parties are called to act can play a role in this process too. And even when they do, scholars usually underline the negative implications for policy production. In this study, I argue in favour of going beyond a viewpoint that only considers the constraining effect, without reflecting also on opportunities, issues, and electoral considerations that arise from a recession period. Are parties able to strategically take advantage of a negative economic situation for adopting their programmatic policies? A recession modifies power dynamics, produces a change in the electorate’s expectations, reduces the availability of financial resources, and increases international and European pressures on national politics. Faced with new external conditions and challenges, how do partisan office-holders react?
This research draws upon a scholarship that empirically explores the existence of a party-policy linkage by looking at the congruence between parties’ electoral promises and policy outputs. This approach considers pledge fulfilment (i.e. the congruence between pre-electoral statements and the legislation enacted once in office) to determine the strength of the party-policy relation. Based on the analysis of election pledge fulfilment in Italy (1996-2018), this study empirically demonstrates that governing parties’ behaviour in times of crisis is essentially different (and it is driven by different factors) in times of crisis compared to normal times: During a recession governing parties adapt their behaviour and strategies to the new context and pressures. Despite the presence of important constraints, governments have electoral and political motivations to still try to carve out space for (some of) their preferred policies. Specifically, this paper shows that an economic crisis does not merely have a detrimental impact on partisan capacities to shape policies. On the contrary, electoral and political motivations, reputation issues, and voters’ concerns are just some of the elements that may boost partisan politics during downturns. 
Results from logistic regressions indeed suggest that the influence of the state of the economy on parties’ capacities to achieve their ideologically-driven policies is largely contingent (1) on the ideological family to which the party belongs and (2) the issue of the policy. Overall, left-leaning governments’ autonomy is heavily curtailed in times of crisis. Nevertheless, they appear to be able to mobilise the discretionary power they have left for realising their policy preferences related to the welfare state. Right parties, on the contrary, are less challenged by macroeconomic factors.",Università di Bologna,,,,,,,,Università di Bologna,,Giorgia Borgnino,,,,,,,,Giorgia Borgnino,,Government,Party Manifestos,Political Parties,Austerity,Policy-Making,,,,"Parties, Policy Issues and the Adoption of Programmatic Policies in Times of Crisis: Italy 1996-2018",https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63532&EventID=185

Yet, there is mixed evidence on how parties represent emigrants’ interests in domestic policymaking: while some pro-actively support legislation to extend emigrants’ rights, others only marginally engage with diasporic communities. We contribute to this literature with new evidence from Spain. So far, little is known about Spanish parties’ positions on emigration or their strategies to connect with the sizeable group of voters abroad. To fill this gap, we use interviews with party leaders and an analysis of emigration salience in the electoral manifestos of all mainstream parties since late 1980s. We show that most parties have significantly shifted their emigration position over time, by becoming more attentive to overseas Spaniards and their rights.

It is less clear whether more politically sophisticated elites like elected officials and public affairs professionals hold equally polarized levels of trust in science.

First, we report results on trust in scientists and scientific institutions from an original survey of 3,500 U.S. political elites, the largest study of its kind ever conducted. Both Republican and Democratic political elites have higher levels of trust in science than Republican voters. Yet among political elites, Republicans have substantially lower levels of trust in scientists and in scientific institutions and less accurate assessments of scientific facts than Democrats. Second, we examine the patterns in the use of science in policy documents from the U.S. Congress and ideological think tanks. We find substantial partisan differences in whether and how much policymakers rely on science.

0,"In current international policy flows, China and Brazil hold particularly privileged places. They are hubs from where development-related policies – including ideas, instruments and programmes – have been travelling from and circulating through. Both countries have been investing in operationalising their development knowledge and transferring development policy both within their regions and beyond. Different parts of the United Nations (UN) system, in turn, have tried to expand their support for policy transfer, notably in collaboration with large Southern member states.

By shedding light on expanding empirical dynamics that have largely remained under the radar of scholarly attention, this paper contributes to debates about the role of multilateral bodies in international development cooperation, on the one hand, and how policies deemed as successful travel within (and potentially beyond) the South, on the other.

0,"Party cohesion is an influential factor in terms of parties’ electoral strategies, their performance in competition as well as their behavior in government. In extreme cases, a lack of cohesion might even lead parties to split along the lines of intra-party frictions. While much of the existing literature on party cohesion is confined to the legislative, disagreement and conflict in the wider party organization – although consequential – are often omitted from quantitative studies due to a lack of systematic data. Following a growing strand of research, this paper proposes party congress minutes as data source to derive systematic behavioral data on intra-party conflict. The study applies various text-analytical measures to a novel dataset on party congresses in Austria (1945-2021) and tests their validity based on a subsample of party congresses preceding four cases of party splits in three parties. Specifically, the analysis evaluates a) whether measures of intra-party conflict indicate increased conflict levels just before the splits occurred and b) whether they can be used to delineate the substantive preference divides between rivaling intra-party groups.

0,"Party position is often seen as a rigid location composed of unitary actors, with the time between elections as a black box. I will look at party position as a fluent process made up of the sum of its members. This leads to two research questions: how does the position of individual MPs relate to the overall party position? And how does the party position change over the course of the legislature? I disentangle the mechanisms that connect both questions in order to understand internal party decision-making. Generally speaking, I show who determines the party position at what point during the legislature by applying quantitative methods to analyse speeches in parliament. I use data from the ParlSpeech V2 data set by Christian Rauh and Jan Schwalbach, which contains all speeches in legislative chambers of nine democracies, covering a period between 20 and 30 years. Since the data includes a high range of parties, I can differentiate between internal organisational structures, party families, or different political systems, although the most important comparison will be between the general party line and its members. I expect the party elite to be the main driver in determining party position, especially towards the end of the electoral cycle. As it is possible that there are differences depending on internal organisation, I hypothesise that this effect is stronger when there is a more hierarchical party structure. On the other side, in parties with flatter decision-making processes, the party position should be reflected more by the median position of all members. Furthermore, I expect parties in the first years of the legislature to be more internally divided than in the months before an election. While moderate deviations from the party line in speeches may be tolerated in general, the closer a party is to a general election, the more cohesive they may want to appear. This means that deviators have to act according to the general party line, or are not even allowed to speak at all. Consistent with the literature, this internal cohesion should be especially strong for governmental parties. This research is important because it helps us uncover internal party mechanisms and who influences party positions at what point in time.",University Greifswald,,,,,,,,University Greifswald,,Sophie Suda,,,,,,,,Sophie Suda,,Comparative Politics,Elites,Parliaments,Political Leadership,Political Parties,Party Members,Quantitative,,"Party position, elite influence, and its development over the legislative period",https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63766&EventID=185
0,"Estimation techniques for party positions rely largely on three different types of data sources: political text, i.e. manifestos, expert placements, or voter perceptions as reported in survey data. While the comparative literature on party systems mostly draws on both text-based and expert placements to analyse party configurations, there are at least two broad strands of literature that face the challenge to combine party positions with voter preference data: the literature on policy voting, and on representation. Here, researchers often rely on voters’ perceptions of parties’ policy positions, as reported in surveys. However, this kind of data is scarce, and often only available for the common left-right dimension, but not for more concrete policy scales. Also, it is known that voter preference and perception data on policy issues suffers from biases caused by persuasion and projection effects, as well as from differential item functioning. While expert placements of parties are of very good quality, it is unclear how they fit into voter preference scales. The same holds true for party positions based on manifestos. This data source is additionally criticized for being biased by issue salience. However, manifestos are often the only available database to estimate party positions for a wide range of countries prior to the 1990s, when e.g. the Chapel Hill Expert Survey was first fielded.
This paper discusses the combination of party positions from different sources with voter preference scales. We draw on data from the German longitudinal election study and compare the performance of different estimates of party positions that we frequently find in the literature: first, the mean self-placement of a party’s voters, second, the mean expert party placement based on an external survey, and third, party positions based on manifesto data. Additionally, we propose a simple rescaling technique to fit party positions from external sources onto the voter distribution. The benchmark for our comparison is the mean perception of a party’s issue positions based on respondent data from the same survey. Since we are interested in the usage of party positions for spatial vote models, our measure for the goodness of fit is the percentage of correctly predicted vote choices in a conditional logit model of vote choice based on issue distance. Our rescaling technique performs very well with expert survey data, and even outperforms mean perceived party positions from the same survey. Thus, it can be regarded a good substitute if party positions based on perception data are unavailable. This offers many opportunities for comparative researchers interested in policy voting and representation, who are often limited in their research by data availability.
Our results raise more general questions about how we should conceptualize and interpret party positions in models of political competition, as well as in representation research. We detect significant differences in the party configuration based on different estimation strategies. Thus, the choice of which party position estimate to use might make a difference.

0,"This paper concerns party-interest group dynamics in the European Parliament (EP) and asks which interest groups EP party groups recognize as relevant. Party recognition can be an important asset to interest groups and it can furthermore signal where the party stands on an issue to the public at large and other EU actors.

This paper investigates party recognition of interest groups across all EP speeches between 1999-2019, thus covering recognition before and after the Lisbon Treaty that further empowered the EP entered into force, and the effects of party and issue characteristics on recognition. With their increased cohesiveness and the EP’s increased powers, EP party groups are likely attractive targets for interest groups that seek to influence EU policy decisions and examining who parties choose to recognize as relevant actors contributes to broader research on interest group access and interest group politics in the EU.

0,"Twitter is now an unavoidable communication platform for most politicians. Data generated by their online activities allow researchers to scrutinize in great detail the different politicians’ messages and interactions. While a lot of scholarly attention is given to the study of politicians’ activities on Twitter, little has been written on whether their inactivity can also be meaningful. This article examines the use of Twitter by 1745 candidates during the 2021 Canadian federal election campaign. It aims at exploring whether inactivity on Twitter is associated with low potential of winning. Riding-level data on each parties’ past results are used to measure the probability of winning of each candidate. Statistical models are then used to study the relationship between the chance of winning and the lack of intensity, or absence, of Twitter activity collected using the platform’s API. Results show indeed a clear correlation, which suggests that even politicians’ or parties’ silence on social media could be meaningful and reveals information on their own evaluation of their chance of winning. From a broader perspective, by focusing on social media inactivity, this research sheds new light on the inferential value and limitations of social media data for political science.",Université Laval,Université Laval,Université Laval,Université Laval,Université Laval,,,,Université Laval,,Justine Bechard,Hubert Cadieux,Alexandre Côté,Axel Déry,Yannick Dufresne,,,,Axel Déry,,Cyber Politics,Elections,Political Parties,Party Members,Social Media,,,,Pawn or King : Does Political Candidates' Use of Twitter Tell us Anything About the Likelihood of Electoral Success for Political Parties?,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=62227&EventID=185
0,"University students’ mobility has resulted in an increased diversity in the classroom, offering substantial benefits but also preparing specific challenges. Both local and international students get an opportunity to share their knowledge, ideas and experience and explore new perspectives that could have so far remained hidden to them. Nevertheless, mixing local and international students also brings difficulties in terms of different level of student knowledge, diverse cultural backgrounds and previous learning experience. This paper explores peer learning - a two-way, reciprocal educational strategy that uses a broad range of activities, in which students assist each other with their learning (Boud et al. 2002) - as an instrument potentially useful to overcome these difficulties. Triangulating data from a course on German foreign policy offered at Masaryk University, Czech Republic (students’ mid-term and final reflective questionnaires, teacher’s diary and a peer observation), the paper assesses the ways peer learning affected the interaction between international and local students and the degree to which it proved to be an effective learning instrument in a mixed classroom.",Masaryk University,,,,,,,,Masaryk University,,Jana Urbanovska,,,,,,,,Jana Urbanovska,,International,Methods,Higher Education,,,,,,Peer learning: An effective strategy for promoting students’ learning in a mixed classroom?,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63135&EventID=185
0,"In the wake of the 2020 U.S. presidential election, the losing candidate and much of his party and following have refused to accept the election results, citing ‘widespread voter fraud‘. Their subsequent measures to ‘stop the steal‘ and secure ‘election integrity‘ have included a range of (violent and even insurgent) acts promoting a manichean worldview, the passage of new voting and election laws as well as partisan election audits implemented by private firms to investigate largely conspiratorial allegations after the conclusion of official post-election auditing procedures.

A Foucauldian governmentality perspective allows to show how these efforts have spanned and appropriated different arts of government. This contribution particularly focuses on the hitherto under-researched ‘audits‘ – rather mundane practices traditionally associated with a (neo)liberal art of government – and demonstrates how they exemplify in a condensed form the current challenges of and to advanced liberal democracy and its epistemic basis.

While these ‘audits‘ draw legitimation from mimicking classical depoliticizing governmental strategies that rely on and in turn produce managerial expertise, they are mobilized to politicize election administration, basic democratic procedures as well as principles undergirding the relationship between the individual and the political community. Applying a genealogical approach to public statements given and documents issued by officials and private groups supporting or implementing these ‘audits‘, I analyze how they (re)form a problem to be governed and a field of possible actions for the governed, and furthermore ask what intra-societal relations they normalize and what norms, (forms of) knowledge, authority and truth claims they invoke.",Helmut-Schmidt-University/University of the Armed Forces Hamburg,,,,,,,,Helmut-Schmidt-University/University of the Armed Forces Hamburg,,Julia Simon,,,,,,,,Julia Simon,,Democracy,Elections,Political Parties,Knowledge,Activism,,,,Pennywise coming for democracy?

0,"This article uses data collected by the European Social Survey from 2016 to analyze welfare chauvinistic attitudes across 19 European countries. Its main focus is on how macroeconomic factors may affect how welfare chauvinistic attitudes are developed across Europe. The study employs multilevel linear regression to analyze both individual level and country level determinants on welfare chauvinism in Europe. It uses several familiar macro-level variables that have been found to influence welfare chauvinistic attitudes, but also introduces three new variables in the realm of unemployment: Native unemployment rate, foreign born unemployment rate and the gap between native and foreign born unemployment rate. It also employs individual-level variables measuring respondents’ perception of these macro-level factors. We find that the individuals in the Nordic and liberal welfare regimes have remained somewhat stable in regards to the most exclusionary form of welfare chauvinism, while there has been a moderate increase in these attitudes in the Southern and Central European welfare states. In the post-communist welfare regimes however, there has been a considerable increase in these attitudes. The multilevel analysis shows somewhat surprisingly that the macroeconomic variables have little to no effect in explaining welfare chauvinism in Europe. Only GDP per capita can be said to have an effect with a p-level under 0,05. None of the variables measuring the different nuances of unemployment can be said to have a significant effect on welfare chauvinistic attitudes across Europe. Interestingly however, is that the perception of the economic situation of the country and the state of the health services can be said to have an effect in explaining welfare chauvinistic attitudes. More dissatisfaction with the economy or the health services are therefore linked to welfare chauvinism. We therefore conclude that objective measures of a country’s economic situation seem to be of little relevance to explain welfare chauvinistic attitudes, it is to a greater extent individuals (often flawed) perception of these macroeconomic factors that help explain welfare chauvinism.",Norwegian University of Science and Technology,,,,,,,,Norwegian University of Science and Technology,,David Andreas Bell,,,,,,,,David Andreas Bell,,Migration,Social Policy,Welfare State,Quantitative,Public Opinion,Survey Research,,,Perceptions and realities: Explaining welfare chauvinism in Europe,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63222&EventID=185

Academic research and journalistic accounts suggest that this burden is disproportionately borne by women. Yet, most research is based on the assumption that what constitutes uncivil content on social media can be defined in absolute terms by uniform criteria. This article adds to this literature by introducing a contextual approach to understanding incivility, which examine how the characteristics of the actors involved in online conversations and those who judge them affect understandings of incivility toward female and male politicians. To do so, we run a (visual) conjoint experiment among both politicians and representative samples of citizens in Canada, Denmark, and Chile.

The centre-periphery conflict has a big impact on several individual attitudes such as voting behaviour, trust in government, and satisfaction with the political system. However, citizens’ perceptions of this conflict have not been explored systematically with regards to its impact on the perceived legitimacy of public policy decisions taken in a multilevel democracy. More specifically, we know very little about how (and to what extent) these centre-periphery perceptions affect the translation of diffuse support –i.e., basic and durable support for the system– for multilevel government into specific support –i.e., support for decisions and actions taken by actors operating within the system– for public policy decisions. We analyse attitudes of Norwegian citizens, and this is important for two reasons. First, in Norway citizens tend to have strong centre-periphery perceptions whereby citizens from the Northern and Western parts of Norway tend to have lower trust in national government. Hence, there is quite a bit of variation in centre-periphery perceptions in Norway. Second, Norway is a unitary country whereby the decision-making process is relatively centralised. Revealing that these perceptions indeed have an effect on the perceived legitimacy of policy decisions would imply that unitary countries are somewhat comparable to federal and regionalised countries.

We measure diffuse support for the multilevel system in two dimensions: self-rule –i.e., authority exercised by a subnational government within its own jurisdiction– and shared rule –i.e., collaboration between national and subnational governments. We hypothesise that citizens who have more peripheral attitudes to value subnational governments more, and that they will be more willing to accept decisions made by the national government if the local and/or regional tiers indicate support for the decision. Similarly, citizens who position themselves on the centre should be more willing to accept a decision made by subnational governments when the national government also support it.

We test these hypotheses through a survey experiment fielded to 1,200 respondents during Wave 19 of the Norwegian Citizen Panel in November 2020. Respondents were asked to what extent they would be willing to accept a decision taken by the local, regional, and national government. After indicating their initial willingness, respondents randomly received a treatment that informs them one of the remaining tiers, or both of them combined, also supports the decision. The results indicate that centre-periphery perceptions have an impact on how and to what extent diffuse support for multilevel governance translates into specific support for policy decisions. Our findings are important as they shed light to varying attitudes towards multilevel government in unitary countries.",Universitetet i Bergen,Universitetet i Bergen,,,,,,,Universitetet i Bergen,,Berkay Alica,Arjan H.

0,"This paper explores what goes wrong when things go wrong in the interactions between citizens and state organizations.  We focus on interactions that involve controversial plans for policy, implementation, and governance. We take conflict as a primary, constitutive, dynamic in these dramas of policy action – i.e. as default.  We analyze a set of practical efforts to address policy goals in this light. This means treating policy action as a practice for engaging conflict and analyzing it through the categories of conflict analysis. The practical initiatives that we focus on involve questions about public health, climate adaptation, renewable energy, nature conservation, and urban development.  From the perspective of conflict, they involve questions about recognition and respect, voice and knowledge, threat and trust, interest and emotion, and legitimacy and agency that play out at a tacit level as they are implied, contested, and resolved or suppressed in the way that people ‘pick up and get on with the business at hand’ (Goffman, 1974). 

We analyze practice in these cases on the basis of participant observation, interviews, and practical discourse analysis.  We start with the conflicting priorities, and interests that set the context for action and focus our analysis on the experience of citizens and stakeholders as they engaged one another and the substantive issues that bound them to, and pitted them against, each other.  A shared feature of these cases is that the conflict was not dominated by tensions between stakeholders with opposing interests competing to influence policy. Conflict was substantially, and with lasting impacts, conflict between citizens and the state actors who bore the responsibility for developing and implementing policy.  The meant that questions about what to do in a particular case were bound up with questions about the meaning of citizenship and trust in, and the legitimacy of, public institutions and policy organizations.  

Our analysis describes the way in which memories of prior interactions with government shaped citizens’ expectations and colored the way in which they interpreted and responded to government action (and inaction). We examine how citizens reacted to policy programs and the way that they experienced the opportunities to comment on and influence these programs.  Our own experience, and the stories citizens told us, inform a narrative of alienation and neglect that derives as an unintended byproduct of what seem, for all intents and purposes, to be well-intentioned efforts on the part of public officials. And the neglect that citizens experience is mirrored in the frustration that public officials feel as their efforts miss the mark and elicit responses that are counter-intuitive and at odds with their goals. We seek to shed light on the mismatches that drive the experience of citizens and public officials and to provide a more nuanced diagnosis that will help make clear where the need and the opportunity for repair arises and how restorative practices might contribute to repair, to practical compromise, and, in doing so, help to shore up the faltering legitimacy of public institutions and democratic practices.",University of Amsterdam,Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam,,,,,,,University of Amsterdam,,David Laws,Anne Loeber,,,,,,,David Laws,,Conflict,Conflict Resolution,Democracy,Governance,Public Policy,,,,Performative deficits and possibilities for repair: A restorative approach to policy conflict,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65287&EventID=185

The cases are from Finland, where there are strong traditions of anti-elitist challenger parties and transnational extremism. The videos chosen are (a) the Finns Party (FP), a radical right party with high levels of popular support, and one of the three largest parties in the Finnish parliament Eduskunta, and (b) the aspiring party Blue-Black Movement (BBM) which includes former FP actives and those belonging to the extreme right – in contrast to another FP splinter, with its clear agenda with fascist undertones it has found difficult to gather the necessary support for becoming a parliamentary party. In our rhetoric-performative audiovisual discourse analysis, the two videos prove quite different in budget and shape, but both include similar themes and use cityscapes for communicating their message. The videos performative features and evoked political myths differ enough to make the engagement with the two meaningful for comparative analysis that can yield insights for further study politics of online meaning-making in the far-right spectrum.

0,"The critical scholarship on the history of the realist tradition of International Relations (IR) – and the whole academic entrepreneurship – have denounced its American, Eurocentric, or Western at most (inter)subjective orientation. Amidst other theoretical approaches in the post-positivist turn in IR, it has exposed the colonial functions this discourse has played in the self-conception of both imperial powers and countries of the periphery of the system – mostly former European colonies – and their effective engagement in the game of world politics. A postcolonial turn has followed, multiplying efforts at producing emancipatory knowledge from the margins of the IR Western core. This paper investigates the reception of the concept of ""peripheral realism,"" originally tailored by the Argentinean author Carlos Escudé in the 1990s, in the Brazilian foreign policy community. Though the concept is one of the most significant contributions to IR coming from Latin America in the last three decades, the idea has not been as impacting in Brazilian foreign policy discourse. Sometimes it is understood as an ""entreguista"" conception of abdicating autonomy in foreign policy in favor of an automatic alignment with the United States. In other opportunities, it gets mistaken for amoral pragmatist policies not fitting national traditions concerning its commitment to international law and the peaceful resolution of controversies. After all, few discrete passages used to justify a more consistent alignment with the great regional power register the limited effective influence of the concept on the political thought of the national foreign policy community. The contentious reception of the Argentinean concept, alongside the broader category of ""realism,"" testifies to the resistance against the naturalization of a postcolonial project for Latin America, specifically the socialization of core and peripheral identities and roles. Still, this opportunity to check the critical reception of a subsidiary realist logic to the periphery may alternatively open emancipatory possibilities for the appropriation of the concept of realpolitik in the periphery – domestic politics and foreign policy – as a principle of prudence in the unresting search of more successful strategies of autonomy and development.",Centro Universitário de Brasília (CEUB),,,,,,,,Centro Universitário de Brasília (CEUB),,Frederico Dias,,,,,,,,Frederico Dias,,Foreign Policy,International Relations,Realism,Theoretical,,,,,Peripheral Realism as colonial strategic culture for the global-South?

0,"This study explores the determinants affecting politicians’ priorities and preferences regarding women’s issues. Moving beyond the simplistic relationship between descriptive and substantive representation of women, we analyze whether various personality traits of politicians are associated with their prioritization of this policy domain as well as their policy position on women’s issues. Based on previous psychological research on the Big Five traits (Openness to Experience, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness and Emotional Stability), we theoretically expect politicians scoring high on Openness to Experience to take more liberal positions on social policies and therefore to be more likely to prioritize and support women’s issues. In contrast, conscientious politicians rather tend to adopt more conservative policy positions and consequently will not pay much attention to women’s interests. Moreover, we hypothesize that these effects are stronger for female than for male politicians. Using original data from a comparative survey of elite politicians in Germany and Switzerland, the results confirm our hypothesis about the positive effect of Openness to Experience on the priority that individual politicians assign to the representation of women’s issues. We do not find any significant effects for Conscientiousness. These findings contribute to the study of women’s representation as well as to the booming literature on the effect of personality traits on politicians’ self-reported policy positions and preferences.",University of Basel,University Greifswald,,,,,,,University of Basel,,Daniel Höhmann,Corinna Kroeber,,,,,,,Daniel Höhmann,,Gender,Parliaments,Political Psychology,Representation,,,,,"Personality and Political Representation - The Relationship Between Personality Traits, Policy Positions and the Prioritization of Women’s Issues",https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=62244&EventID=185
0,"Philanthropy stands at a conflictual position when it comes to its relationship with democracy. The point of juncture, and therefore the source of their opposition, is that these two forms of collective decision-making aim at the same ends: public purposes. But if many scholars have discussed the normative question of why philanthropy might or might not be desirable in a democracy, few have paused to address the prior and more fundamental analytical question of what makes philanthropy inherently specific. The potential danger that philanthropy might bring to democracy is generally described in consequentialists terms. Contrary to that, I argue that this conflictual relation is less related to its consequences and more connected to the way philanthropy is exercised. The way one can derive authority from gratuitous donations will always be incompatible with democratic credentials. In one hand, democratic decisions will apply jointly over each citizen while instantiating a direct relation of accountability between them. In the other hand, philanthropic acts allow individuals to influence the public by their own preferences. I offer a political definition of philanthropy as acts carrying a form of authority characterized by two individually necessary but jointly sufficient constitutive rules: plutocracy and third personality. By plutocratic, I understand that philanthropy’s authority is derived from material resources that are external to the democratic decision process. Therefore, philanthropy instantiates a fundamentally asymmetric form of decision-making because the source of this authority (i.e., wealth) is unequally distributed between people. Philanthropy is also third-personal in the sense of appealing to relations of accountability that are linked to personal reasons that are relative to individual agents. To the question: Who should be providing public goods, third-personality answers: ‘‘Voluntary individuals because of their love for humanity’’ where democracy would respond ‘‘all citizens themselves through a collective system due to their interrelations of accountability’’.",University of Geneva,,,,,,,,University of Geneva,,Matthieu Debief,,,,,,,,Matthieu Debief,,Civil Society,Democracy,Elites,Political Theory,Agenda-Setting,Normative Theory,Capitalism,,Philanthropy's Inherently Political Nature,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65881&EventID=185
0,"Growing public dissatisfaction with representative democracy has spurred extensive experimentation with new ways of doing politics in Western democracies. Increasingly popular are innovations that seek to involve citizens more deeply in policy-making via organized policy discussions (that is, deliberation). Yet, despite the popularity of deliberation in both theory and practice, it remains ambiguous how citizens themselves think about this political practice. Existing studies return contradictory findings: some suggest widespread enthusiasm for deliberation, others point towards public skepticism instead. We address this puzzle by means of a series of focus groups conducted among politically dissatisfied citizens in Belgium (n=54) : non-partisan activists (Yellow Vests, Youth for Climate)  and politically disadvantaged citizens (non-national inhabitants of deprived neighborhood who experience racialization, people who experience homelessness and working-class people who experience casualization of work contracts in EU Parliament). We embedded a picture task in each of the focus groups, asking citizens in an open and accessible way what they think about deliberation and other political practices. We find that how citizens make sense of deliberation matters for their attitudes towards it. We find that when citizens thought of deliberation as low-key, informal discussion, they linked it to respectful communication and beneficial outcomes such as learning, bridging differences, and problem-solving; when they thought of it as formalized, structured discussion, their appraisals became much more negative. Our argument, then, is that differences in sense-making could account for the conflicting findings in the literature on citizen support for deliberation. The practical implication is that forms of deliberation that do not resonate with what people experience in everyday conversations might have a hard time to garner citizen support and convince citizens to participate. In order to “democratize democratic innovations”, to be more inclusive and to echo the lived experience of the most powerless citizens, we must gain a more nuanced understanding of how citizens relate to deliberation, grounding democratic theory and practice in citizens’ own experiences. Our study shows how, importantly, nearly all our focus groups exhibited highly developed levels of engagement and understanding, suggesting that such levels of sophistication are not reserved for the most politically active or educated citizens. More than a side-result of our study, it confirms important statements in political theory about the possibility of political equality and how to realize it in discursive settings with ordinary citizens, especially the one that might feel the most excluded by political innovations.",Université de Paris I – Panthéon-Sorbonne,Université catholique de Louvain,,,,,,,Université de Paris I – Panthéon-Sorbonne,,Guillaume Petit,Ramon van der Does,,,,,,,Guillaume Petit,,Citizenship,Democracy,Political Participation,Representation,Qualitative,Experimental Design,,,Picturing deliberation: How dissatisfied and disadvantaged citizens make sense of deliberation,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63742&EventID=185

This paper presents exploratory evidence from a pilot study of Novaland, an online state in which volunteers act and interact on a text-based platform. Thereby, the online behaviour of participants affects their actual financial pay-out. This novel research design builds on text adventures in pedagogy and gaming, on social psychological role-taking by experimental design, and on behavioural and survey instruments. The main causal effects analysed are whether absolute levels of and relative changes in income inequality affect political solidarities, that is, the individual willingness to support public redistribution in favour of other social groups. Theoretically, the paper concentrates on individual-level mechanisms from the Meltzer-Richards-Model and the Deservingness Literature. 
The paper systematically presents the technical realisation of the pilot platform. In addition, it reviews measures of internal validity (do participants behave predictably and consistently within the experiment?). Finally, the paper puts forward assessments of external validity (do causal effects in the online world reflect actual causal effects outside?).

The extent to which carbon taxes play a role in mitigating climate change is unclear. We take as a starting point the observation that the implementation of carbon taxes has not conformed with neoclassical economics theories. With this paper we aim to contribute to a better understanding on whether carbon taxes have a place in policy mixes for climate change mitigation by analysing their design. To do so, this paper examines the provisions and prescriptions of carbon taxes adopted in fourteen European countries. First, we review the current state of the art in carbon taxes research. Second, we present a novel framework to unpack the provisions and prescriptions in the design of a carbon tax. As next step, we apply the framework to the cases. Lastly, we discuss whether carbon taxes have a specific place within the broad spectrum of climate policy mixes. Through these steps, the research question this paper intends to answer is: which place, if any, does a carbon tax have in climate policy mixes, through its in-design provisions and prescriptions?

0,"At the centre of the project Vienna Climate Games was the co-creation of a serious game, in the form of a climate action card game, together with Viennese school students. The motivation behind designing a game was to create an educational tool that will allow school students to explore the dynamics of climate policymaking. The game allows young people to gain insights into the roles played by interests and resources in politics by adopting different roles and negotiating climate policy measures for the City of Vienna from this range of perspectives. This is in answer to the commonly held frustration over the disconnect between climate science and policy measures to reduce emissions. 

However, the process of co-creation was also paramount in order for the range of opinions on climate policy held by young people, beyond ‘Generation Greta’, to be reflected in the game. As a result, four different young people are included as actors in the game, drawn directly from data gathered with and from students from schools across Vienna. In this paper we reflect on the process of co-creation of a climate action card game with young people, including our use of workshops, future scenarios, Q-method, expert interviews, and various rounds of game development, testing, and feedback. Furthermore, we draw conclusions that are relevant for engaging young people in designing climate policy measures at the city level. In particular, we highlight the potential for playful solutions, such as serious games, to open the door for young people to engage concretely in shaping climate policy outputs",University for Continuing Education Krems,,,,,,,,University for Continuing Education Krems,,Sarah Louise Nash,,,,,,,,Sarah Louise Nash,,Local Government,Climate Change,Youth,,,,,,Playfully protecting the climate: co-creation of a climate policy negotiation serious game with school students for the city of Vienna,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65477&EventID=185
0,"Popularised by Kent Weaver and later Christopher Hood, blame avoidance behaviour (BAB) refers to those strategies employed by political elites to minimise blame and manage risk. However, studies of politicians’ BAB have largely relied on secondary data recorded in the media or parliamentary records (e.g. Hansard), and none have gone far enough to consider the individual differences of those who engage in BAB or the ways in which these characteristics might encourage or mitigate BAB. This paper addresses each of these gaps in the existing research base.

Firstly, I seek to replicate two existing insights from observational studies of BAB using experimental data gathered directly from politicians. Principally, I test a reactivity hypothesis whereby officeholders are more likely to engage in BAB when levels of blame are high (H1) and a sequencing hypothesis whereby officeholders will ‘retreat’ through types of BAB in predictable patterns (H2). Secondly, I analyse the importance of two salient sets of psychological characteristics: namely politicians’ personality traits (i.e. the Big Five) and their ‘felt’ trust and distrust. On one hand, I propose that politicians with high scores for extraversion and openness will be less likely to exhibit BAB regardless of the level of blame surrounding them, whilst politicians with high scores for neuroticism, agreeableness and conscientiousness will be more likely (H3). On the other hand, I propose that politicians who feel or perceive high levels of public trust/distrust will be less/more likely to use and then double down on BAB to compensate for, or anticipate, the mediated reception of political choices amongst their electors (H4).

To test H1-4, I present the findings of a survey experiment fielded to elected councillors (local politicians) in the United Kingdom (N=440) as part of a larger funded study of trust and governance. Focusing specifically on presentational strategies following a hypothetical scandal, this experiment placed participants in three treatment conditions that varied the level of blame between low, moderate and high. Participants could then choose between three responses indicative of PD, PA+RD, and PA+RA. If participants opted for either of the first two strategies, they were presented with more information about the development of the scandal. In this follow-up scenario, which takes places 24 hours later, the level of blame increases further and politicians are once again presented with three possible response options indicative of PD, PA+RD, and PA+RA. Politicians also completed the Ten-Item Personality Inventory (TIPI) and a 24-item battery of felt trust and distrust (PTB-24). 

The significance of this paper is two-fold. Firstly, I contribute methodologically to our understanding of how BAB might be studied by replicating observational findings using experimental data gathered directly from elected representatives. Secondly, I contribute substantively to our understanding of why BAB occurs in politics by analysing the impact of politicians’ individual differences (both trait-based and cognitive) on BAB.",University of Sheffield,,,,,,,,University of Sheffield,,James Weinberg,,,,,,,,James Weinberg,,Elites,Political Leadership,Political Psychology,Decision Making,Survey Experiments,Empirical,,,"Playing the game and dodging the blame: an experimental study of trust perceptions, personality traits, and politicians’ blame avoidance behaviour.",https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63353&EventID=185
0,"As part of the research project “Asserting the Nation: Comparative Studies on the Rise of Neo-Nationalism in Higher Education” this paper will explore the empirical findings of an on-going study of the impacts of neo-nationalism on Poland's higher education system. Data collection took place during the spring of 2022 at the sites of three Polish universities as well as through interviews with relevant actors in the policy-making community. Currently the Polish government is asserting state authority towards the educational system to a degree not seen since the fall of the Berlin Wall.  This paper presents preliminary analyses of how this trend affects the state of academic freedom in the country, and how the academic community is responding to it.
The Polish institutions of higher education have traditionally been characterized by strong collegiate decision-making power, possibly the strongest in Europe (Kwiek, 2010, 2015). Over the last decade politicians have sought to ‘professionalize’ and ‘modernize’ the sector which to some extent has changed this picture (Dakowska, 2015, 2017). In effect, in 2011 a twenty-year long period of ‘policy of no policy’ was succeeded by state assertiveness which manifested in neo-liberal policies. Moreover, the ruling party’s modus operandi of counter-elite populism, through with which it has targeted and overhauled both the judiciary system and public media, has since 2020 also been aimed towards the educational domain (Bill, 2020; Bill & Stanley, 2020; Dobbins, 2017). The Polish academic community is therefore currently operating within a system steered according to neo-liberal principles, which the ruling party is criticizing through neo-nationalist and catholic discourse as well as reshaping to promote ideologically aligned researchers. In a national context, where the relationship between the higher education sector and the state has been described as a ‘deadlock of mistrust’ (Antonowicz, Kulczycki, & Budzanowska, 2020), and where academics’ sense of autonomy is rather strong, this study asks: how does the conflict over academic freedom configurate the strained relationship between the academic community and the state? How does the polish academic community engage with and adapt to this political turn? What pressure is exerted on academics through allegations of being a ‘pseudo-elite’ 
The concept of neo-nationalism was first developed in the context of the 2004 EU enlargement and through the analysis of how parties of the so-called ‘new right’ in Western EU-member states shared an identity critical of the EU and its expansion (Gingrich, 2006; Gingrich & Banks, 2006). This paper’s contribution will consist in furthering the conceptualization of how Poland, where populism and nationalism carry particular post-communist features, fits into the wider neo-nationalist picture, considering how the concept initially grew out of historical experiences made in ‘old Europe’. Moreover, against this backdrop, the contribution will also consist in offering new empirical perspectives on how neo-nationalism is impacting the historical relations between state and universities.",Aarhus Universitet,,,,,,,,Aarhus Universitet,,Rasmus Harsbo,,,,,,,,Rasmus Harsbo,,Nationalism,Policy Analysis,Populism,Higher Education,,,,,Poland’s neo-nationalist turn in higher education through counter-elite populism: empirical findings on academic freedom in Poland,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64651&EventID=185
0,"The transition form socialism into capitalism and a parallel transition from dictatorship into democracy was viewed in the political economic literature by many, as an unfeasible process. Potential losers of the transitional process and economic chaos and recession would create a demand for political parties, who would overturn the process of this dual transition. This approach can be interpreted within a Polanyian narrative, as the possibility of a countermovement against marketization.
In spite of these fears, economic institutions evolved towards a very liberalized competition state like setup, that was supported by the big majority of political parties. Central and Eastern European countries thus became the straight A student of economic liberalization and following the recipe of the Washington Consensus.
This has been changing a lot, especially since the Great Recession of 2008. It can be argued, that the crisis hit the societies of the region hard for the second time, and this second hit caused the turnaround that was originally expected to happen in the 1990s.
This paper tries to collect and analyse data starting from the regime change in order to illustrate the effect of the transformation on the societies of these countries, especially from a welfare perspective. The goal is to illustrate the devastating effects of the regime change and the 2008 crisis, and to put the political changes of the post-2008 CEE into a Polanyian perspective.",Corvinus University of Budapest,Corvinus University of Budapest,,,,,,,Corvinus University of Budapest,,István Kollai,Gabor Vigvari,,,,,,,Gabor Vigvari,,Democracy,Democratisation,Populism,Capitalism,,,,,"Polanyi, neofeudalism, and populism in CEE",https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63707&EventID=185
0,"There has been a lot of scholarship debate recently about the impact polarization is having on current politics, from its impact on party systems and government behaviour to its impact on individual political participation . The literature has analysed polarization either at the systemic level focused on the perception of ideological distance between parties (horizontal polarization) or at the individual level focused on the perceived distance between voters’ and parties ideological stances (vertical polarization) (Rodríguez-Teruel 2020). The existence of party system polarization increasing the distances between political parties makes party-switching less likely, benefitting those parties already represented in the institutions. At the same time, we have observed the successful emergence of new parties benefitting from this polarization in many European countries. While previous research analyses how the perception of horizontal and vertical polarization has an impact on voting behaviour, little attention is paid to its impact on other forms of conventional participation such as party membership and activism. Recent studies point out towards stability or increase of party activism in contrast with the decline of party membership and the relevance systemic and party factors might have to explain this different trend (Heidar 2006; Scarrow 2007; Ponce and Scarrow 2014; Bale, Webb and Poletti 2020; Demker, Heidar and Kosiara-Pedersen 2020; Rodríguez-Teruel, Correa and Barberà 2021). 
In this paper, we test the effect of polarisation on citizens’ party affiliation. Are polarised individuals more likely to get involved in party activities? In general terms, do more polarised countries have higher levels of party involvement? To respond these questions, we address the issue at two different levels, comparing among countries and among individuals. We will pay particular attention to Southrn European countries, where trends of recovery in party activism have been detected in a recent own study (Rodríguz Teruel, Correa and Barberà, 2021). We use ESS data to first assess the aggregate impact polarization has as a mobilising effect on party activism in European democracie and second, assess the impact polarization has at the individual level.",Aston University,University of Valencia,,,,,,,University of Valencia,,Patricia Correa,Juan Rodríguez Teruel,,,,,,,Juan Rodríguez Teruel,,Comparative Politics,Political Participation,Political Parties,Southern Europe,,,,,Polarised militants: mobilizing party activism in European countries,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65606&EventID=185
0,"In May 2021, a 15-day lasting violent crisis between Israel and Jihadi groups from the Gaza strip ignited, mainly engendered by two incidences in Jerusalem - a decision by the Supreme court of Israel who decided to evict four Palestinian families near Sheikh Jarrah, and the repeated storming of the al-Aqsa Mosque by Israeli police forces. Embedded in the ongoing Israeli-Palestinian conflict, worldwide waves of public indignation, commiseration but also condemnation for both conflict parties could be observed across social media channels, including Twitter. Hashtags supporting either Palestine or Israel registered a steep increase starting around May 10th, the day Hamas launched the first rockets toward Israel. 

On the surface, it seems that citizens of most Western countries exhibit more empathy for the Palestinian side and tend to perceive Israel as the aggressor. Interestingly, Germany on the other hand does not seem to adhere to this pattern, as prevalence for anti-Palestinian opinions also increased during the crisis. This study aims to investigate how the Israeli-Palestinian crisis is reflected within the German Twitter-sphere and why it diverges from the international debate. More specifically, we analyze the prevalence, content, and sentiment of the main narratives with respect to pro-Palestinian/anti-Israel as well as pro-Israel/anti-Palestinian sentiments according to different political factions. Another focus lies on the strategic use of communication by politically fringe actors. Previous work showed that violent incidents, such as terror attacks, are strategically utilized by radical or extremist actors to push ideologically fueled or even extremist attitudes to the forefront of public perception. Thus, the current work also aims at dissecting the strategic use of the public discourse across political parties, such as far-left and far-right actors. Against the background of Germany's historically evolved relationship with Israel, the crisis has reignited the perennial debate on anti-Semitism in Germany. Especially as the debate was accompanied by many street protests by communities originating from the Middle East, this study places a special focus on the spread, its polarizing effect as well as strategic use of the crisis and the accompanying anti-Semitic sentiment by far right and other politically extreme actors in their attempt to mainstream their radical sentiment. Eventually, we aim to identify some of the key catalysts that have fueled the discourse in the German Twitter sphere by associating social media trends and themes to critical offline events, such as missile launches, police violence, territorial destructions, fatalities, or collateral damages.",Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München – LMU,Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München – LMU,Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München – LMU,German Institute for Global And Area Studies,German Institute for Global And Area Studies,,,,Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München – LMU,,Heidi Schulze,Simon Greipl,Julian Hohner,Mirna El Masri,Thomas Richter,,,,Julian Hohner,,Cleavages,Extremism,Social Media,,,,,,Polarization and Opportunism: How Germany escorts the Israel-Palestine crisis on Twitter,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65135&EventID=185
0,"This paper explores the potential of agonistic democratic theory to guide analyses of contemporary polarization tendencies. Two claims are defended. First, agonistic democratic theory offers suitable conceptual resources to determine why polarization is problematic for democracies. While Chantal Mouffe distinguishes between ‘enemies’ and ‘adversaries’ to describe the central goal of democratic politics, i.e. the transformation of antagonisms into agonisms, this distinction can also serve a diagnostic purpose: in circumstances characterized by affective polarization, the willingness of political opponents to treat each other as adversaries erodes. Second, an agonistic lens can open up perspectives for possibilities to overcome polarization. Agonists can outline institutional designs that would require political actors to comply with the rules of agonistic conflict processing. In addition, they can show what forms of dialogue might help heal polarized relationships, precisely because agonistic forms of dialogue aim at transforming the political relationships among opponents rather than at overcoming the underlying disagreement. The paper challenges perceptions of agonistic democracy as a theory that welcomes polarization and demonstrates how it can enrich critical engagements with at least certain forms of polarization prevalent today.",Westfälische Wilhelms-Universität Münster,,,,,,,,Westfälische Wilhelms-Universität Münster,,Manon Westphal,,,,,,,,Manon Westphal,,Conflict,Democracy,Political Theory,,,,,,"Polarization, Agonism and the Crisis of Democracy",https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65257&EventID=185
0,"This paper proposes a joint application of online network analysis and Natural Language Processing techniques to contribute to ongoing discussions about the ways in which women, their bodies and choices are included in but also constituted by contemporary public discourse for how it develops within large-scale social media discussions.
It does so by exploring and comparing two cases that occurred in Italy between 2019 and 2020. The first case refers to Carola Rackete, the Captain of Sea Watch 3, who forced her way into the port of Lampedusa on 26 June 2019 to rescue migrants' lives. The second case concerns the release on 9 May 2020 of Silvia Aisha Romano, an NGO aid-worker kidnapped in Kenya and returned home converted to Islam. 
Both events triggered two extremely heated discussions that pivoted around opposing collective (mis)representations of the two women that were shaped at the intersection of stereotyped visions particularly of gender, age, religion, and political activism. Yet, these two discussions occurred in conjunction with diverse government alliances in the country. While Rackete disembarked in Italy during the “yellow-green” government, formed by Five Stars Movement and the League, Romano was rescued by the “yellow-red” alliance mainly constituted by the Five Stars Movement and the Democratic Party. 
In this work, we claim that public (mis)representations of both Rackete and Romano were tailored and circulated instrumentally as weapons in the context of highly polarized political dynamics fed by legacy media, political leaders, and a myriad of citizens. We argue that political antagonism drove the choice of stereotypes that were used by adversarial groups to recount the two women and defeat political adversaries’ projects and visions. We thus explore how switching political alliances engendered different systems of “polarized intersectionality” - that is, (mis)representations of women in the public discourse that develop at the intersection of different axes of discrimination and in conjunction with political polarization dynamics.
Starting from two dataset of 227.001 tweets about Carola Rackete and 55.897 tweets about Silvia Aisha Romano, we design two semantic networks where tweets are linked whenever retweeted by the same account(s). Through the application of community-finding algorithms, clusters of tweets are isolated that approximate the conversational areas structuring the two discussions. We derive the overall political leaning of these conversational areas starting from the presence of tweets authored by political parties, leaders, and partisan media accounts. We then analyze these conversational areas through Top2Vec technique, a topic modeling based on sentence embeddings and density clustering, to identify the different topics feeding the two discussions. After comparing tweets’ communities to infer general levels of polarization, we associate political and semantic positions with specific (mis)representations of the two women. Finally, we examine our results to understand if (mis)representations of Rackete and Romano changed over time and depending on transformed political alliances.
Our preliminary results seem to confirm that intersectional (mis)representations of Carola Rackete and Silvia Aisha Romano permeate both discussions and all political groups albeit taking different forms and, in fact, depending on the varying geometries of partisan oppositions.",Università degli Studi di Torino,Università degli Studi di Trento,,,,,,,Università degli Studi di Trento,,Antonio Martella,Elena Pavan,,,,,,,Elena Pavan,,Cyber Politics,Elites,Gender,Political Competition,Social Media,Big Data,,,Polarized intersectionality in Italy: changing political alliances and the weaponization of women's public representation,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65607&EventID=185
0,"Global challenges, such as climate change, require increasingly horizontal governance approaches, as solving such challenges is dependent on coordinated policies between the administrative sectors of energy, transport, industrial, environment, finance, innovation, social, education, foreign and security policies. Such coordination is difficult, because administrative sectors have long traditions, their own worldviews, and specific objectives they seek to advance. This paper is focused on the complicatedness of achievement coherence between energy and security policies, in a time when the energy sector is being decarbonized and major geopolitical shifts are taking place partly in connection to the energy transition. 
Drawing on the literature on policy coherence and integration, the paper analyses in total 60 expert interviews from three Nordic-Baltic European countries: Estonia, Finland and Norway. It pays attention to administrative interaction between energy and security, the presence or absence of strategies, agencies and mechanisms for horizontal coherence, political coherence, and the integration of security into energy policy and vice versa. Based on ongoing analysis, the countries show significant differences and interesting features for policy coherence connected to the European energy transition. 
For instance, Finland has a long tradition of relatively successful horizontal governance, and it has been used in preparing cross-governmental climate and energy strategies for the past two decades. Yet, the connection between energy and security is not part of this regular horizontal exchange, and some argue that energy has in effect been desecuritised and apoliticised (political incoherence), partly due to Finland’s history and economic relations with Russia. Yet, simultaneously, also successful measures for policy coherence exist, such as the National Security Council including energy questions, public-private ‘Power Pools’ preparing regularly for crisis situations, and cyber security work and critical materials assessments by the National Emergency Supply Agency. Yet, these efforts look at energy and security always from the perspective of one of the domains and not holistically, and common strategy or vision for security and the energy transition is missing. 
Instead, Estonia is largely relying on informal structures for policy coherence. Mechanisms for coherence are created as bottom-up problem-solving mechanisms instead of setting such mechanisms from the start to increase synergies and prevent conflicts. Energy, security, foreign affairs and defence actors share common perspectives on the synergies between the advancing energy transition and security. The clearest conflict is between expanding off-shore wind energy and interference of military radars, and another well acknowledged between the dependency of the Ida-Virumaa region on oil shale. Despite an open acknowledgement of the importance of national security in the energy transition, transitions may not be advanced rapidly and transparently enough when reliant on informal interaction alone. 
The final paper will also include an analysis of Norwegian policy and politics at the interface of security and energy, and an overall discussion.",University of Sussex,,,,,,,,University of Sussex,,Paula Kivimaa,,,,,,,,Paula Kivimaa,,Policy Analysis,Public Administration,Security,Qualitative,Energy,Energy Policy,,,"Policy and political (in)coherence, security, and Nordic-Baltic energy transitions",https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63665&EventID=185
0,"Policy change is one of the core variables of interest in policy process research. At the same time, policy change has been differently operationalized in the research literature, which makes it different to compare empirical results across theoretical frameworks and contexts. In this article, we conceptualize policy change as a latent variable that is not directly measurable but needs to be operationalized through manifest variables. We propose four manifest variables that constitute the latent concept of policy change: regulatory depth, financial expenditures, changed actor constellations, translation of policy core beliefs.

To empirically assess whether this latent concept is valid, we triangulate three methods of measuring these manifest variables, taking the example of German health policy. Firstly, we ask experts of the policy sector to evaluate for different reforms to what extent they are characterized by one of these elements. Secondly, we analyze the parliamentary discourses surrounding these reforms to single out the terms that are connected to these different reforms, to allow for a narrative measurement of the manifest variables. Thirdly, we qualitatively investigate the reforms to evaluate the extent to which they resulted in these dimensions of policy change. Our findings show to what extent the measurements of policy change overlap and therefore provide a valid operationalization that is potentially applicable to different contexts and cases. We discuss challenges of these measurements, particularly time lags and the assessment of policy core beliefs.",TU Braunschweig,Universität Bern,TU Braunschweig,TU Braunschweig,,,,,Universität Bern,,Nils C.

0,"Is the organisation of ministerial portfolios associated with governments’ policy priorities? Specifically, do policies targeting energy efficiency in residential buildings vary depending on where the portfolios of Energy and Environment sit? Poorly insulated houses contribute significantly to countries’ CO2 footprint and lead to higher levels of energy poverty. Effective solutions remain evasive, at least in part because governments’ policy strategies are often uncoordinated. However, governments cannot formulate coordinated strategies unless they facilitate such coordination through the organisation and design of ministerial portfolios. Political agendas and preferences alone cannot fully explain policy choices; the organisational design is also critical (Hall 1996). This ‘political/policy game’ should have direct effects in policy continuity and effectiveness. Yet, it is under-studied and poorly understood. Using unique new data on the structure of ministerial portfolios in 15 European countries over thirty years, we test the hypothesis that when the departments of Energy and the Environment are major portfolios and have been in place for longer period of time (spanning government changes), they will be associated with a higher number of policy initiatives aiming at higher levels of energy efficiency. In contrast, when the department of Energy is a minor portfolio under Business or Economics, policies for improving energy efficiency are likely to be fewer and less ambitious.",University of Strathclyde,,,,,,,,University of Strathclyde,,Despina Alexiadou,,,,,,,,Despina Alexiadou,,Government,Public Administration,Policy-Making,,,,,,Policy Coordination and Energy Efficiency,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64773&EventID=185
0,"Sustainable transition to a low carbon (energy) system will require policy durability in climate change mitigation. Although policy feedback influences policy durability, its effects on policy design and subsequent policy implementation are not well understood. In this paper this gap is addressed by synthesizing policy feedback theory with the multiple streams framework to develop hypotheses on the relationship of feedback on problem, policy, and politics. This conceptualization is used to compare the contrasting experience of the adoption and implementation of carbon taxes in Australia and Sweden; while the latter expanded policy ambition in a step-wise manner, the former repealed policy adoption before implementation could even begin. A process tracing analysis of policymaking and implementation is conducted in the two countries using data from news articles, policy documents, and secondary literature. The results show that in Sweden feedback from policy design and implementation strengthened the coupling among the problem, policy and politics streams and facilitated a more stringent carbon price over time. In contrast, in Australia the feedback from policy design led to pronounced interest group activity, partisan politics, a change in public mood, and problem reframing. These dynamics were effected, and exploited, by a policy ‘terminator’ – during a window of opportunity – to re-couple the streams that led to repealing the policy adoption.

0,"This paper examines the integration of economic and environmental policies in Uruguay’s forestry sector since the 1990s. Based on a qualitative analysis of policy documents, sector reports, parliament hearings, and semi-structured interviews with key stakeholders we demonstrate that policy integration has continuously increased with no major setback using the framework of Candel and Biesbroek. To understand the drivers and dynamics of this evolution we draw on concepts from the advocacy coalitions framework. This shows that although there is a broad consensus that environmental concerns in the forestry sector need to be addressed, two main environmental advocacy coalitions have crystallized with fundamentally different core beliefs as to what exactly sustainability means in relation to the forestry sector. This divergence of beliefs and political polarization regarding the meaning of sustainability in the forestry sector is an important obstacle to a more holistic approach which is a key element of the highest levels of policy integration. Our analysis suggests that such holistic approaches require a normative political basis, particularly for a complex and multidimensional topic like sustainability. While participatory approaches may help to foster this, this is by no means straightforward and it is likely that longer time periods are needed for this. It also indicates that the role of international actors, notably foreign transnational companies and international civil society in processes of policy integration deserves more attention and a better conceptualization in existing theoretical frameworks.",Westfälische Wilhelms-Universität Münster,,,,,,,,Westfälische Wilhelms-Universität Münster,,Melisa Deciancio,,,,,,,,Karen Siegel,,Environmental Policy,Latin America,Policy-Making,,,,,,Policy integration in a newly established natural resource-based sector: challenges for sustainability,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64924&EventID=185
0,"Although the characteristics of policy mixes – coherence, comprehensiveness, consistency, and credibility – are posited to be important for policy success, whether they influence policy outcomes and, if so, how positive outcomes are realized is rarely studied empirically. In this study, we shed light on the relationship between policy mixes and policy outcomes through an abductive approach in the case of cycling policy in the Netherlands, a country renowned for its bikeability. Specifically, we trace the policy mixes, the modal share of cycling, and policy feedback during 2001-2020 in two Dutch municipalities with varied trajectories to success. We find that the characteristics of the policy mixes – especially credibility, consistency, and coherence – were indeed associated with policy success. Further, policy entrepreneurship – which has not received adequate attention in the literature on policy mixes – played a key role in developing these characteristics. We conclude by formulating hypotheses on how different types of policy entrepreneurship might influence the evolution of policy mixes.",Delft University of Technology,Delft University of Technology,,,,,,,Delft University of Technology,,Nihit Goyal,Wijnand Veeneman,,,,,,,Nihit Goyal,,Governance,Policy Analysis,Public Policy,Qualitative,Policy Change,Policy Implementation,Policy-Making,,"Policy mixes, policy outcomes, and policy entrepreneurship: A comparative study of the success of cycling policy within the Netherlands",https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63888&EventID=185
0,"The first study combining methods from the sociology of elites (positional, reputational, relational and decisional) and from policy studies (discourse and process analysis), which led to the elaboration of the programmatic action framework (Hornung, Bandelow, 2018), pinpointed the key role of a programmatic elite, composed of specialized senior civil servant, in the reforms of the French Welfare State, especially for health insurance, since the 1980’s (Genieys, Hassenteufel, 2015). In this paper we try to understand how the actors involved in this policy transformation constitute a social group, empirically studied in the long term (from the 1980’s to the current period) in three successive research programs. Five intertwined dimensions are analysed.
The first one is the similarities of the trajectories of these different actors, who have the same educational background and career (most of them having studied at Sciences Po and the Ecole Nationale d’Administration and then choose to specialize in the welfare policy administration).
The second dimension is the density of interactions between these actors who share the same socialization and know well each other, with a transmission process through different generations. 
The third dimension is that they share a same policy change program base on the reinforcement (and the shaping) of state institutions in order to regulate more efficiently the healthcare system (cost containment) and to extend health insurance coverage (univeralization of the French health insurance system). After having successfully transformed the institutional organization of the French healthcare system between 1996 and 2009 (with three main reforms), these actors have been transformed in custodians of these institutions and more generally of the transformation path they have initiated and conducted. Their new role as custodians of a State policy (Genieys, 2010) has reinforced their identity.
The fourth dimension investigated is the role of institutions in the shaping of a programmatic group. The French “Welfare Elite” is deeply linked to an administrative institution: the Social Security Directorate (DSS) where most of these policy actors have worked and got their specialized expertise on health insurance issues. In a dynamic perspective the decisional positions held by the leading actors of the programmatic group gave them also the opportunity to strengthen this administrative unit, especially with the yearly elaboration of the Social Security Finance law since the 1996 reform, in which they were strongly involved. 
The last dimension explored is the role of power conflicts with other groups in the structuration of a collective actor. In this paper we analyse how the strong link between the policy capacity of the French Welfare Elite and the DSS was challenged, in the context of the “Great Recession”, by the supervisory power given by the government to the Finance Ministry since 2007. Dealing strategically with the new supervisory role of the Finance Ministry, the specialized Welfare Elite was able to reinforce its policy role and its identity against other senior civil servants, during the financial crisis and afterwards.",Sciences Po Paris,The University Paris-Saclay Graduate School for Sociology and Political Science,,,,,,,The University Paris-Saclay Graduate School for Sociology and Political Science,,william genieys,Patrick Hassenteufel,,,,,,,Patrick Hassenteufel,,Elites,Public Policy,Welfare State,State Power,Policy-Making,,,,Policy transformation and the shaping of a social group: the case of the French Welfare Elite,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65856&EventID=185
0,"In this study, we analyze organic and paid social media communication from political candidates, parties, and other social media users, in the lead-up to the 2021 German federal election. We document the activity of coordinated networks of Facebook pages and groups dealing with the election, the investment in Facebook advertising of the main parties and their targeting strategies, as well as the engagement they reached organically. We collected the Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter social media accounts of the seven main parties (AfD, CDU, CSU, DIE LINKE, FDP, DIE GRÜNEN, and SPD) and their candidates, relying on the official websites of the parties and the lists of “Direktkandidaten” and “Listenkandidaten” published in the lead up to the elections. We also compiled a list of 450 political-related keywords, updating the lists used by GESIS to monitor previous elections in Germany (e.g., Stier et al., 2018), to collect posts published on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. We collected all social media posts that matched the keywords or were posted by the monitored accounts in the six weeks leading up to the elections by using CrowdTangle API and Twitter API v2. We used the same list of accounts and keywords to collect all advertisements through the Facebook Ad API. The final dataset included 4,561 social media accounts of parties and candidates and 281,830 social media accounts sharing political content, for a total of 668,032 Facebook posts, 129,317 Instagram posts, 20,703 Facebook advertisements, and 1,820,156 Twitter posts. As in the 2019 European election in Germany (Hegelich & Serrano, 2019), the populist right-wing party AfD reached an exceptionally high organic engagement on Facebook, and the green party Die Grünen and conservative CDU led the standings of the Facebook advertisement investment. Nonetheless, they were both overtaken in the overall number of ad impressions by the economic liberal FDP, who strategically spent less on a higher number of advertisements. Considering the area of microtargeting, our findings show that the content of some advertisements was exclusively targeted to women and young generations. They, however, represented just a modest part of the total number of advertisements run by parties and candidates. Using the R package CooRnet (Giglietto, Righetti, & Rossi, 2020), we also found large coordinated networks on Facebook spreading far-right and anti-establishment narratives, as well as anti-lockdown and anti-COVID19 policies messages. In these networks, harsh comments against opponents and a wide range of sources that shared disinformation during the elections (NewsGuard, 2021) were common.

0,"Political discussion is a cornerstone in modern liberal democracies, both inherently and through enhancing political self-efficacy, political interest, political trust, political knowledge, political tolerance, and political participation. Yet, political discussion is often found to be depressed by diversity of identities and opinions, which is a fact in modern societies. In this article, we investigate how schools succeed in their mandate to prepare young citizens to engage in political discussions through fostering an open classroom climate that encourages to discuss respectfully with people with different opinions. By using a nationally representative data of 5,274 15–16-year-old comprehensive school students in 63 majority language and 17 minority language schools in Finland, we assess the effects of political affinity in the class, belonging to the class, and minority status on open classroom climate. Furthermore, we test whether the possible negative effects of a lack of political affinity on the discussion climate can be mitigated by belonging or minority status. Based on the results, we conclude that belonging to the class and, to a slightly lesser extent, minority status predict open classroom climate, while political affinity is at its best a weak predictor. Yet, lack of political affinity cannot be compensated by other variables. Thus, we suggest that schools invest in enhancing feelings of belonging to the class to make open, and diverse political discussions possible and raise discussing citizens.",Tampere University,University of Turku,Tampere University,,,,,,Tampere University,,Venla Hannuksela,Miikka Korventausta,Josefina Sipinen,,,,,,Venla Hannuksela,,Citizenship,Education,Political Engagement,Youth,,,,,Political affinity and class community explaining open classroom climate among minority and majority adolescents,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64779&EventID=185
0,"Political culture is often conceptualised as a factor for the stabilisation of democracy and democratic citizenship. Culture is thus conceived as a functional dimension, but often without critically analysing the design of concrete political cultures in regard to universality and particularity. The questions about ""the content what has to be diffused"" and ""how much of what must be present in a country"" (Almond/Verba 1963: 9f.) remain unanswered (Gabriel 2009: 27). 
In the political practice, the cultural concept of the dominant community prevails as the reference and is increasingly used as an instrument of political governance (cf. Mouritson et al. 2019 on ""Leitkultur debates""). However, the particularisation of political culture sabotages the original intention of its system-stabilising functionality. The preference for one group as a reference leads not only to a representational deficit, which promotes mistrust and non-identification of the marginalised, but also to identity- and culturally splitting divisions in political discourse between the 'normals' and the 'others' (in Germany prominent with regard to East Germans and migrants as the 'others': Foroutan/Hensel 2020).
In order for political culture to be truly system-stabilising, the reverse view becomes important: the role of citizenship on building political culture. Here, the constructivist paradigm alongside the functionalist paradigm offers at least three advantages.
1) The paradigmatic expansion enables deeper analyses that examine the various instances of the democratic ""feedback loop"" (Easton 1965: 28) and thus make new understandings possible. Therefore, the hitherto predominant quantitative research needs to be accompanied by a qualitative programme, bringing into focus not only the effects (trust, support) but also their causes. The focus here is on narrative, symbolic, and material communication elements that often trigger heated disputes.
2) The expansion of the empirical perspectives offers conceptual and empirical connections between citizenship and political culture research. On the one hand, citizenship models emphasise various rights as a prerequisite for political inclusion (Marshall 1950); on the other hand, they point out that status, feeling and practice are also constitutive (Osler/Starkey 2005: 10ff.). Therefore, theories of the sociology of emotions and praxis lead to new understandings, e.g. with regard to emotional regimes (Reddy 2001), the relevance of critique (Norris 1999) and the (non-)acceptance of participation and protest forms.
3) Overall, the integration of the constructivist paradigm enables an extensive capacity for interconnection, which can transform the previous multidisciplinary coexistence into interdisciplinary cooperation (Marej 2020). For this purpose, political sociology (Holzer 2020; Kaina-Römmele 2004), political psychology (Brunner et al. 2004) and political anthropology (Shore/Wright/Però 2011; Pajo/Power 2017) are the most obvious options.
Constructivist approaches of citizenship studies as well as broader discourses on the connection between culture and politics, can therefore enrich political culture research and strengthen its explanatory and predictive power. As a foundation for the proposed paradigmatic expansion, the ontological premises of homo oeconomicus (Giddens 1984; Lutz/White 1986), homo socio-oeconomicus (Lindenberg 1990) and homo culturalis (Panther/ Nutzinger 2004) are contrasted in order to clarify the social and cultural perspectives on the political and to strengthen the self-reflection of the research field.",Westfälische Wilhelms-Universität Münster,,,,,,,,Westfälische Wilhelms-Universität Münster,,Katarina Marej,,,,,,,,Katarina Marej,,Citizenship,National Identity,Political Methodology,Political Sociology,Constructivism,Qualitative,Political Ideology,Political Cultures,Political Culture (Research) and Citizenship (Studies) between Functionalism and Constructivism,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65846&EventID=185
0,"Since the early 2000s, the Spanish Ministry of Defence and the Armed Forces have developed a public policy planned to promote defence culture to influence Spanish society’s views, perceptions, opinions, etc., towards defence and military policies. However, this approach is flawed because, despite being defined as part of the Spanish citizens' political culture, these institutions reduce this concept to ""knowledge"" or ""awareness of its importance"". Therefore, the understanding of the Spanish defence political culture has been ill-analysed. Hence, a political culture related to defence issues can be best explained within the political culture framework, from which an ideal type, in Weberian sense, can be established. Thus, based on previous studies and from multiple survey data and using a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), we test five sub-models in order to explain this political culture. The relevance of this research is evident both for the advancement of political culture theory and the enrichment of the study of Spanish Armed Forces-society relations, as well as due to its original policy-oriented perspective.",Universidad de Granada,,,,,,,,Universidad de Granada,,Alberto Bueno,,,,,,,,Alberto Bueno,,Citizenship,Civil Society,Political Cultures,,,,,,Political culture and defence policy: a five-subtype model to analyze the Spanish case,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=66022&EventID=185
0,"There are several political and professional challenges in democratic political culture which, despite evidence of their existence, remain at a secondary level. This is the case with gender distribution across the main top careers in general, and in particular, those within the political sphere. Despite the important steps already taken, particularly from a neoliberal perspective and discussion, the number of women who reach prominent positions in political careers is still disproportionally small. However, can we say that we are in a reversing cycle process, in structural terms, with regard to the dominance of men in leadership and top positions, in political (and several other) institutions, such as Parliaments and Governments? In this contribution we selected the role of political culture and political socialization as the root and enhancer of gender differences in the attribution of top political positions, considering the case of Portugal in a European comparative perspective.Following Dalton and Welzel (2014), we defend that we are experiencing a deeply rooted change in political and civic culture. In this regard, the structural transformation, from an allegiant to a critical and assertive attitude and behaviour tends to be an important step towards a more balanced gender assimilation. In other words, assertiveness is one of the attitudes and concepts that may reinforce social and political integration and participation into the democratic system.
	This study follows a cross-cultural perspective, concerning the leading political careers’ in terms of gender distribution, in the EU concerning the leading political careers in terms of gender distribution in the countries of the EU. Following this perspective, we defend the relevance of cultural and socio-economic structures, as mediated and reinforced by mass communication processes on a global scale.
	Regarding the context of analysis, we aim to respond to the following question: are we experiencing a reversing cycle in structural terms, with regard to the dominance of men in leadership and top positions in institutions? With these issues and question in mind, we aim to discuss the role and influence of political culture and political socialization on the access to a political career, using the Portuguese case in a comparative perspective.",Institute of Social and Political Sciences - University of Lisbon,,,,,,,,Institute of Social and Political Sciences - University of Lisbon,,Paula Espírito Santo,,,,,,,,Paula Espírito Santo,,Democratisation,Government,Parliaments,Comparative Perspective,Political Cultures,,,,Political culture and gender inequality in Parliament and Governments.

0,"Due to the complex nature of corruption, apart from its economic dimension, the political character should be stressed as well. The stable political system ensures the exercise of consistent policy allowing governments the implementation of long-term policies. Democracy is less susceptible to corruption as it is linked to the advancement of freedom and accountability, which, among other factors, permit institutional reinforcement and sustainability. Also, the significance of governance should be stressed regarding economic, political and social development. Based on empirical estimation, the following fundamental results emerge. Firstly, competitiveness might contribute to the combat of corruption through the elevation of reforms and structural adjustments. Moreover, the advocacy of democracy and political competition might contribute to the control of corruption. In addition, democracy might fortify competitiveness concerning the control of corruption safeguarding a stable political system for the application of reforms associated to the strengthening of structural competitiveness. Therefore, the reduced effectiveness of policies concerning the control of corruption might reveal weak political development. Regarding the sustainable prospect of anti-corruption aims emphasis should be placed on long-term factors, which are consequently critical under the sustainability prism. The aforementioned deficiencies plague political and social development, abolish political rights and suppress civil liberties. Regarding the efficient constraint of corruption, countries should not only be economically developed but robust as well in terms of social conditions and political institutions. Hence, the deep confrontation of corruption on a sustainable basis requires the unimpeded participation of citizens within context of sociopolitical consent.",University of the Aegean,,,,,,,,University of the Aegean,,Maria-Eleni Syrmali,,,,,,,,Maria-Eleni Syrmali,,Democracy,Development,Governance,Social Capital,Methods,Quantitative,Corruption,Empirical,Political Development and Institutions: An Empirical Approach,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65209&EventID=185
0,"Solar power has witnessed the largest cost reduction among renewable energy technologies over the past two decades. While rooftop solar panels continue to be an important form of harnessing solar power, large scale solar parks have seen rapid diffusion in recent years and are considered to be indispensable for low-carbon energy transitions. Whereas ambitious renewable energy goals are typically defined at supranational and national levels, the implementation of projects such solar parks directly affects the living area of a large number of local communities
raising the questions of how local political support for such projects gets mobilized and sustained. This paper focuses on the German federal state of Bavaria which has recorded the largest number of solar parks in Germany. We ask how the the political party composition of municipality councils and the general political mood of voters at the municipality level (green vs. far-right votes) affect the willingness of local decision-makers to give the approval for the construction of solar parks. The time period of our study covers two local legislative terms 2008-2014 and 2014-2020. We find that the composition of the municipality council has a strong effect on the construction of solar parks. The high share of social-democratic members in the municipality council has a strong positive effect while the high share of independent members highly decreases the probability that the municipality will host a solar park. We also find that the high share of far-right populist votes does not negatively affect the construction of solar parks. Our analysis yields important new insights into multi-level political dynamics which shape the local decisions to approves large scale energy projects such as solar parks.",Technische Universität München – TUM School of Governance,Technische Universität München – TUM School of Governance,,,,,,,Technische Universität München – TUM School of Governance,,Stefan Ćetković,Jules Bertemes,,,,,,,Jules Bertemes,,Local Government,Political Parties,Populism,Climate Change,Energy Policy,,,,Political drivers of the adoption of solar parks at the local level: The case study of Bavaria,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65143&EventID=185

Building on the principal-agent and blame avoidance frameworks, this paper develops a theory of authoritarian responses to the global pandemic drawing from theory-informing study of Russia. Contrary to the prevailing policy centralization trend, the response to COVID-19 in Russian Federation was however delegated to the sub-national level of government. The regional authorities faced a trade-off between saving the lives of the population and minimizing economic losses. I argue that preferences of the sub-national leaders regarding the trade-off were primarily determined by political incentives and their personal characteristics, specifically proximity of elections, governor’s power, and governor’s status of the outsider.

In fact, informal institutions such as clientelism and dynasticism are far more critical drivers of career choices made by political elites. Contrary to the expectation that in a high-risk, hybrid political context we would find integrated careers, instead, our data set reveals that a majority of politicians prefer to have alternate careers at either the provincial or national level without much mobility between levels of government.",University of Birmingham,University of Waterloo,,,,,,,University of Birmingham,,Sameen Ali,Mariam Mufti,,,,,,,Sameen Ali,,Asia,Comparative Politics,Elites,Institutions,Political Parties,Candidate,Electoral Behaviour,,Political Elite Careers in Pakistan,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=62364&EventID=185
0,"While recent years have seen a growing body of research on the political impact of migration on the country of origin, the literature on the nexus between migration and political elites is still rather limited. The existing literature is, thematically, mostly focused on the impact of foreign educated heads of state on their countries’ democratisation and, methodologically, overwhelmingly quantitative. Hence, there is a gap with regards to the processes of (re)socialisation and diffusion that may lie behind the political activities of a broader segment of the political elite such as returnee members of parliament (RMPs). 
Drawing on documentary research and qualitative interviews, we compare the democratic diffusion performed by RMPs from two countries with mass emigration to Western democracies but with different political systems and migration patterns – Romania and Turkey. More specifically, we contrast RMPs to non-RMPs in terms of their profile (party affiliation, gender, level of education) as well as the shares and content of their parliamentary questions on two democracy-related and highly topical themes: gender and immigration. The paper argues that RMPs are more concerned with these themes and that their respective views have been influenced by their migration experience. This is the case for RMPs in both Turkey and Romania, despite the notable differences between the two national contexts.",Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona,Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona,Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona,,,,,,Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona,,Vladimir Bortun,Eva Ostergaard-Nielsen,Deniz Pelek,,,,,,Vladimir Bortun,,Comparative Politics,Democratisation,Elites,Gender,Migration,Parliaments,Immigration,Policy-Making,"Political elites, migration and democratic diffusion: Returnee MPs’ attitudes to gender and immigration in Romania and Turkey",https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65673&EventID=185
0,"Although the relationship between language and political views and action, is often assumed, specially by scholars adopting a constructivist standpoint (e.g., Wendt, 1992; Schmidt, 2010, Hay, 2011), this connection has been difficult to test in a rigorous manner given the difficulties capturing and comparing ideational contexts, and in particular the evolution of meanings and shared understandings of socio-political contexts. 

Our interdisciplinary research overcomes this problem developing an innovative method to map semantic spaces and trace political frames trajectories, generating quantitative data that can be used to analyze the connections between changes in ideas and socio-political phenomena. We test our approach in Spain where the political/ identarian Catalan conflict has made political frames acquire a particular salience. The fight for political hegemony implies a fight at the ideational level and specially a competition in terms of decontestation of meanings of certain key concepts, such as “the people” and “the nation” (Ranciere 1995; Freeden 1996). Language helps to discursively create internal frontiers and to fix political identities around them (Laclau and Mouffe 2001; Laclau 2005). Media frames activate “frames of thought” and therefore impact the way in which the public processes and reacts to information. (Chong and Duckman 2007).

Using an unsupervised machine learning method we track the relative salience, level of semantic fragmentation and fluctuations in meanings of a set of key political terms in the two largest Spanish newspapers, El País and El Mundo throughout, 8 years (2012-2019). We scrape the text of each year of the sequence mentioned (via Python code) and generate semantic spaces from each text via Latent Semantic Analysis (Dumais 2004). Then we align all these spaces for each newspaper (using Gallito Studio) (Jorge-Botana et al 2020) and extract indices (using R code and gallitoAPI service) capturing the fragmentation of the meaning of key frames, as well as their relative salience in each year.  Finally, we use new institutional theory (Hall and Taylor 1996) to explain the observed changes in political frames in the context of the Catalan political crisis. We demonstrate that the paths followed by relevant nationalist/identity-related frames fit a punctuated equilibrium model (Baumgartner and Jones, 2010) and that some political events in Catalonia, acted as critical junctures, leaving long-lasting legacies in the meanings reflected in Madrid’s press.

The methodology presented in this paper aims to pave the way for a more integrated comparative analysis of policy and social change, by providing a tool to capture numerically and represent visually the ideational context and trace frames in written communication or in transcribed oral ones.

0,"In the most recent decade Eastern Europe has been increasingly associated with democratic backsliding. While some countries in the region continue this process, it is relevant to understand how this can be stopped. This paper addresses this question and uses Bulgaria as a case study of a country that brought the democratic backsliding to a halt in 2021. Although it was the first country after WWII that held three parliamentary elections in one year, the political instability in Bulgaria resulted in a positive outcome. We show how the coordinated action of political parties before and after elections ended the decade-long political domination of the conservative Citizens for European Development of Bulgaria (GERB) and its leader Boyko Borisov. The democratic backsliding in Bulgaria was stopped through a response to GERB's dominance by a loose coalition of newly formed opposition parties. This created a cordon sanitaire that isolated GERB and prevented its return to power unlike what happened several times in the past. Our qualitative analysis relies on process tracing and uses data from party documents (manifestos), public statements from the elites belonging to the parliamentary parties in the three Bulgarian parliaments of 2021, and media reports. The findings of this paper demonstrate the importance of party response for resisting democratic backsliding.",University of Glasgow,University of Glasgow,,,,,,,University of Glasgow,,Petar Bankov,Sergiu Gherghina,,,,,,,Petar Bankov,,Europe (Central and Eastern),Political Parties,Demoicracy,,,,,,Political Instability vs. Democratic Backsliding: The Dual Role of Parties in Bulgaria,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65995&EventID=185
0,"In a hybrid media environment, politicians have gained new ways of reaching their electorate through social media, allegedly circumventing established media gatekeepers. While this story is hardly new, it remains unclear if these digital transformations fundamentally change established media logics and gate-keeping mechanisms. Do social media afford new agenda setting power to politicians, or is their issue attention still defined by thematic agendas driven by traditional media? Do politicians and news media even share the same agenda, or can we witness an increased disconnect of what is deemed important by the different actors, giving rise to potential fragmentation? Not only are these questions still out for debate and beg further empirical evaluation. Particularly little attention has been paid to the different temporalities afforded by social and legacy media, begging the question of how they shape attention dynamics and define the mechanisms unique to  hybrid media environments.
In order to answer these questions, the proposed paper utilizes the Twitter communication of politicians as a proxy for their issue attention. Two novel datasets of 502.525 Tweets by German politicians elected on a state, federal and European level, as well as 133.554 articles of established German news outlets, both collected between January and July 2021, are analyzed and systematically compared. Using a dynamic graph-based methodology, we identify trending topics in politicians’ tweets and news outlets’ articles. By generating word co-occurrence networks from the documents, we can identify clusters of densely connected words as topics and changes in their network centrality as trends. By employing vector autoregression models on these topics in social and news media, we quantify potential agenda-setting effects between established media and politicians’ issue attention. Of special interest are the timeframes in which politicians and media outlets divert attention to a given issue. These are analyzed by selecting the optimal lag length of the vector autoregression models via statistical criteria, shedding light on the distribution of timeframes in the agenda setting effects between social and news media.
Preliminary results show that, rather than uniformly changing the gate-keeping structure to the benefit of politicians, a hybrid media environment affords divergent temporalities in the communication of political issues. While not independent of the established media discourse, politicians aim to divert their electorate’s attention to specific issues in shorter cycles than the established media outlets by using digital communication tools such as Twitter. Not only does this paper introduce a novel graph-based approach towards the study of political issue attention. It also contributes to the ongoing debate on the transformation of mediated publics with a case study on the issue attention and news coverage of Germany’s hybrid media environment.",Hildesheim University,Hildesheim University,Hildesheim University,,,,,,Hildesheim University,,Alexander Brand,Tim König,Wolf J.

Covid-19 has had a major impact to society and economy, and it is seen as a major driver for the transformations of education in Europe, including the potential impact on education equity, the implications of the online conversion of classroom teaching, and an overall increased responsibility of education systems in the pandemic and post-pandemic world. In this respect, the Covid-19 pandemic also portends a troubling scenario in terms of an economic, social, and geopolitical crisis, which ultimately could potentially endanger democratic societies. In short, Covid-19 might also represent a risk in relation to the erosion of democracies with populists potentially taking advantage of the social panic and insecurity felt by the general public. Within this context, the teaching of political literacy, namely political knowledge which helps citizens to make sense of their political world and make them effective in public life through knowledge, skills and values, has been only marginally covered in civic education curricula. By conceptualizing political literacy as a common European public good, this paper examines the state of the art of political literacy in European schools. Specifically, the paper first looks at how political literacy is embedded into curricula, how is taught and what kind of training and support teachers receive in the secondary schools of Italy and the UK when it comes to political literacy. Then, the paper examines to what extent political literacy is incorporated within European education strategies and policy initiatives regarding citizenship education.

However, in addition to party animals and technocrats, political outsiders with neither relevant service to the party nor suitable expertise succeed time and again in becoming ministers. How can their unlikely rise to the highest echelons of power be explained? We posit that dynamics within parties – intra-party democracy and aspects of power concentration such as party leader autonomy, party factionalisation and federalisation – play a decisive role. To test our hypotheses, we combine novel, granular career data on ministers from 30 European countries (1945-2020) with party-level indicators for statistical analysis.

0,"Why do politicians vote to decentralize power and resources? Drawing on structuralist and voluntarist approaches, we investigate why national party elites in Pakistan voted to devolve power to the provinces under the 18th Amendment to the 1973 Constitution but are hesitant to devolve meaningful fiscal and administrative power to the local level. We argue that the explanation for this disjuncture lies in Pakistan’s history of military experiments with local government, its candidate-centered party system, and the re-election incentives of politicians at the national, provincial and local levels. Using interviews with local government representatives, politicians, and bureaucrats, and archival research through National Assembly, Senate debates and newspapers, we show that devolution to the provinces was a means of holding a fragile federation together. However, Pakistan’s political parties, unable to elicit credible commitment from their legislators, feared that devolving power further could result in party defections, the rise of regional leaders, and inevitably, party fragmentation.",University of Birmingham,University of Waterloo,,,,,,,University of Birmingham,,Sameen Ali,Mariam Mufti,,,,,,,Sameen Ali,,Asia,Elites,Federalism,Local Government,Political Parties,Regionalism,Qualitative,,Political Parties and Decentralization in Pakistan,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=62363&EventID=185
0,"In recent years, local migrant integration has evolved. On the one hand, scholars' focus has shifted on local areas, trying to understand how immigrant-origin people are included in local politics (Ireland 1994; Fennema/Tillie 1999). On the other, there has been a greater commitment at the local level to integrate new citizens through associations and cultural activities (Pilati/Morales 2018). For citizens of immigrant origin, who hold the Italian citizenship, there are many opportunities for political participation. Among which participation and representation in political parties. Until 2020, the participation of people with an immigrant background was very low in the autonomous province of Bolzano, partly due to the integration policies of the different parties. In fact, left-wing parties have always strived for immigrants’ integration, whereas right-wing parties for assimilation or non-integration (Medda-Windischer/Carlà 2015). In the South Tyrolean municipal elections of 2020, however, 45 people with an immigrant background run for office and out of these 45 candidates, five were elected, marking the highest number ever in the province. Given the very high number of candidates of immigrant-origin running for office, this article aims to analyze how the issue of migration is addressed by political parties and whether they consciously recruit candidates of immigrant-origin.

These efforts to preserve privacy are added to those of national authorities such as the Commission Nationale de l'Informatique et des Libertés of France, the BfDI of Germany or the AEPD of Spain. For their part, political parties have shown a great ambition to collect abundant information on affiliates, supporters and voters to encourage or demobilize, both during electoral campaigns and for their daily operations. Considering that personal information of an ideological and partisan nature is particularly sensitive, there is tension between governments, independent authorities and political parties, as the scandals related to the activities of the company Cambridge Analytica have shown.

0,"Political polarization is undoubtedly increasing in many Western democracies. From the perspective of democratic theory, however, it is an open question how this development should be evaluated. Many liberal commentators fear that polarization not only threatens social cohesion, but also undermines the legitimacy of democratic governance by making cooperation and compromise more difficult and incentivizing divisive, zero-sum politics. This view has recently been challenged by arguments that stress the epistemic value of polarization. Polarized politics might increase democratic legitimacy by making latent social conflicts more visible and enhancing the contrast between political alternatives. In this paper, I will argue that these two assessments only appear to be in conflict. Rather than contradicting each other, they refer to two different forms of polarization - affective and ideological polarization – that have different effects on the legitimacy of democratic governance. Drawing on the political science literature, I will first distinguish between these two types of polarization and then argue from a democratic theory perspective that only affective polarization poses a threat to democracy legitimacy by giving the minority valid reasons to doubt the trustworthiness of the majority. On this basis, I will then consider how democracies should respond to different forms of polarization.",Johann Wolfgang Goethe-Universität Frankfurt,,,,,,,,Johann Wolfgang Goethe-Universität Frankfurt,,Cord Schmelzle,,,,,,,,Cord Schmelzle,,,,,,,,,,Political Polarization and Democratic Legitimacy,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=66034&EventID=185
0,"The German populist radical right party ""Alternative for Germany"" (AfD) was founded amid various economic and political crises. This article argues that the electoral success of this political challenger, however, is rooted in more than the upsurge of populist resentments born out of these crises. Integrating theories about the activation of attitudes with arguments about the effects of exposure to local political contexts, I contend that the electoral success of the AfD reflects the mobilisation of deep-seated nativist sentiments. To test these propositions, I draw on a large panel dataset of the AfD's electoral returns at the municipal level (N=10694) which I link to pre-crises data on the marginal success of extreme-right parties. Exploiting variation between municipalities located within the same county (N=294), I estimate a series of spatial simultaneous autoregressive error models by maximum likelihood estimation. The results show that the success of the AfD is rooted in the local prevalence of nativist sentiments that date prior to the crises that fomented the formation of the challenger party--an effect that becomes stronger in the course of the radicalisation of the AfD. I further demonstrate that the populist right AfD is best able to *broaden* its electoral appeal among local communities with an extreme-right sub-culture, particularly in Eastern Germany. This suggests that even small extreme-right networks can act as a breeding ground for the populist right and help spread xenophobic and nativist sentiments among citizens.",European University Institute,,,,,,,,European University Institute,,Julia Schulte-Cloos,,,,,,,,Julia Schulte-Cloos,,Nationalism,Populism,Electoral Behaviour,,,,,,"Political potentials, deep-seated nativism and the success of the German AfD",https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63289&EventID=185
0,"Over the past decade, “political realism” has emerged as a prominent dissenting voice in political philosophy; at the same time, a lively debate has begun to take shape over what kind of normative commitments and possibilities for intervention come with an allegiance to the realist approach and its critique of “political moralism.” Critics of the approach claim that its emphasis on facts and contexts brings with it a conservative bent and a complacency with regard to the status quo, while advocates purport to develop an approach to politics that elaborates a distinctively political normativity. 

Our project contributes to this debate by exploring the commitments of a realist position to a conception of *positive freedom*. A cursory look at realist writings of liberty (Williams 2005; Hall 2017) might lead one to conclude that realism shares Isaiah Berlin’s preference for a negative conception of freedom—and, indeed, Williams’s criticism of “the Rousseau outlook” suggests an association of positive freedom with precisely the kind of moralism that realism rejects. But we believe this view simplistic, arguing that not only is realism compatible with a positive conception of freedom, but that a certain kind of positive freedom is a necessary condition of realist political normativity, while also showing how realism is able to reconstruct positive liberty in a way that frees it from the problematic associations for which it has famously drawn criticism in the past.

We make our case via a reconstructive reading of Reinhart Koselleck’s _Critique and Crisis_. Like Berlin and Williams, Koselleck harshly criticized the promethean moralism of the Radical Enlightenment; however, he also recognized the unsustainability of any arrangement that tries to banish positive moral agency from the political realm. The inevitability and necessity of such agency comes into even sharper relief when we consider the essentially crisis-ridden character of modernity: modern society is structurally prone to periodic disruptions and breakdowns that call for urgent yet legitimate public action, which in turn must presuppose a capacity of social actors for *crisis consciousness*—that is, a capacity to take action on the basis of normative judgments about how their society ought to be and what has gone wrong. In a related vein, Judith Shklar warns of ever-present threats of regression in moments like these (Shklar 1984; 1989). We argue that, not only must such a capacity for crisis consciousness be described in terms of positive freedom, but any political realism aspiring to vigilance regarding such threats must include a robust conception of positive freedom in its normative repertoire.",Johann Wolfgang Goethe-Universität Frankfurt,University of Limerick,,,,,,,University of Limerick,,Ilaria Cozzaglio,Brian Milstein,,,,,,,Brian Milstein,,Political Theory,Critical Theory,Freedom,Methods,Realism,Regression,Normative Theory,,"Political Realism, Crisis Consciousness, and the Priority of Positive Freedom",https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=62314&EventID=185
0,"The available literature that has analyzed the Portuguese politics during the past decade of crisis described the country as the exceptional case in Southern Europe (De Giorgi and Santana-Pereira 2020; Moury and De Giorgi 2015; Tsatsanis et al. 2014; Freire et. al. 2014). The scholarly works’ main conclusions highlighted the continuity and the resilience of the Portuguese political system under the impact of the post-2008 crisis. Thus, Portugal becomes an interesting case study regarding the implications of the Covid-19 crisis. While moving the analysis of the Portuguese case beyond the discussion about its exceptionalism (Silva et. al. 2021; De Giorgi and Santana-Pereira 2020), the research question of this paper is the following: What drivers may explain the high levels of Portuguese political stability during the Covid-19 pandemic? To this end, one will use a qualitative-interpretative methodology based on the analysis of the most important social and political events occurred between 2nd March of 2020 – i.e., the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic in Portugal – and 30th January 2022 – i.e., the day of the early legislative elections. Such analysis of the events, which unfolded during almost two years of Covid-19, will be organized into the two main group indicators of political stability, drawn from the Ersson and Erik-Lane’s work (1983): the social and the political indicators. Among the social indicators will feature the presence/absence and number of a) protest demonstrations; b) riots; c) armed attacks; and e) political strikes and f) citizens’ trust. Among the political indicators will feature the presence/absence and the number of a) executive renewals, adjustments or transfers; b) number of governments; c) volatility and d) governmental change. Drawing on the works of Tsurutani (1968), Lipset (1960) and Lijphart (1968: 8), three other indicators will be added, namely the absence/presence of major political movements opposed to the democratic rules of the game; the existence of a viable consensus; and the system’s ability to survive intact.
The research expectations are twofold. On the political side, it is expected a validation of the general political consensus that has dominated the Portuguese politics in the last decade or so. On the social side, it is expected to confirm low levels of social disorder identified by previous studies (Magalhães 2005: 988). The research findings will allow one to scrutinize both the political and social factors which helps to explain the Portuguese political stability during the hard times of Covid-19 pandemic. This study’s main conclusions will be important to move the discussion about the Portuguese case not only beyond the notion of exceptionalism or miracle, but also beyond the analyses exclusively focused on the party arena and political system, by highlighting the impact of the pandemic both on political and social arena.","MINHO, University of",Research Center in Political Science (CICP) – UMinho/UÉvora,,,,,,,Research Center in Political Science (CICP) – UMinho/UÉvora,,Laura C.

0,"Political culture and understandings of democracy

Generally, analyses of political disputes involve the consideration of explicit and conceptual discourses voiced by different interested stakeholders. In order to deepen such analyses and take into consideration some neglected (and probably unexpected) aspects of political life, it is worth combining sociological interpretation with insights from cognitive linguistics. This theoretical endeavour is carried out in this paper, which focuses on software development for neuroimaging studies and claims that political disagreements frequently take the form of a clash between metaphoric and metonymic reasoning.
Neuroimaging is the study of the brain via images. Since the late 1990s, a broad range of software packages have been developed for analysing brain data and producing brain images. Even though most of these packages have been released as open-source products, there are also some successful packages developed as close, proprietary products.
The ideological clashes between proprietary and open-source software are well-known and have been studied in detail. Here it is claimed, however, that in addition to analysing such conceptual disagreements, it is worth understanding how these discourses are structured in terms of constitutive concepts and linguistic strategies.
The ideology of open-source software draws on a metaphor (SOFTWARE IS A MACHINE) that depicts software development as a technical activity that requires institutional organization, scientific knowledge, and access to financial resources. As a consequence, large corporations would be endowed with the most appropriate means to engineer efficient software. In their turn, members of open-source communities rely on a metonymic understanding (the PRODUCT FOR PROCESS metonymy) framing software as the outcome of a development process that can be more or less collaborative. In this metonymic approach, politically sound development processes are those which open up more space for open, collaborative, and democratic relations between software developers.
In line with the proposal of cognitive linguistics, it is assumed here that metaphors and metonymies are not simply resources used by artists; they are rather common cognitive strategies that inform various sorts of human understanding, including political stances. Moreover, it is claimed that by considering the relevance of (unconscious) linguistics practices, it is possible to refine analyses of political life. In this way, one can, for example, analyse how some companies have been able to strengthen their discourse by combining (metaphoric) technical arguments with claims pointing to (metonymic) social concerns around software development.
The politics of metaphors and metonymies is not manifested only in the domain of software. Metaphors require an abstract reasoning that is in line with the comparisons and estrangements promoted by typical capitalist relations and schemes. In their turn, metonymic reasoning requires consideration of concrete relations, which constitutes a cognitive tool frequently mobilized by minority or resistance movements willing to enlarge the scope of democracy.",University College London,,,,,,,,University College London,,Edison Bicudo,,,,,,,,Edison Bicudo,,Democracy,Interest Groups,Political Psychology,Political Sociology,Narratives,Political Ideology,Capitalism,Political Cultures,Political stances and cognition: proprietary versus open-source ideologies in software development,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63765&EventID=185
0,"Political parties associated with armed groups are often characterised as cover organisations or mere mouthpieces; secondary and auxiliary components of militant movements which are driven above all by military imperatives. In many conflict situations however, the political wings of armed groups have made a full transition to conventional electoral politics with considerable success while the armed wings have faded away. This is represented by many analysts as an unanticipated outcome; movements are represented as being forced into electoral politics. This paper, in contrast, treats the successful transition to electoral politics as a strategic imperative for armed groups. It examines the tensions and balance between armed force and political activism in managing this transition for militant Irish republicanism during the Northern Ireland Troubles from the late 1960s to the 1990s. The paper is based on interviews, archival research, newspaper research and an analysis of the discourses surrounding electoral politics in republican publications and key speeches. The paper argues that the movement was driven from an early stage by the strategic political imperative of ending its armed campaign and making a successful transition to electoral politics. It considers the implications of this case for understanding the use of violence by non-state armed groups and the role of party politics in their strategic choices.","National University of Ireland, Galway",,,,,,,,"National University of Ireland, Galway",,Niall O Dochartaigh,,,,,,,,Niall O Dochartaigh,,Conflict,Nationalism,Political Parties,Political Violence,Terrorism,Political Sociology,Peace,Political Activism,Political violence to party politics: the strategic imperative of electoral politics for militant Irish republicanism,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63896&EventID=185
0,"In the past decade, politicians have become more and more familiar with social media as platforms for public communication. Research shows that politicians adopt social media for many different purposes, including promotion (Hoffmann et al., 2016): they aim to bring attention to relevant topics and distribute political messages to enhance their personal profile and to reach out to potential supporters. On social media, this is done by engaging primary (followers) and secondary (other people in their respective networks) audiences (Vaccari & Valeriani, 2015). Politicians often share links to news stories from mainstream or alternative outlets, which are similarly dependent on the reach of their articles with primary and secondary audiences (Karlsen, 2015). Thus, when sharing news on social media, politicians act as media opinion leaders (Katz & Lazarsfeld, 1955), affecting the reach of news media, but the motives for and the effects of this practice have not yet been thoroughly examined. This study focuses on the public impact of politicians’ news sharing behavior on Facebook in three European countries. More specifically, we will investigate user engagement with news shared on the Facebook-pages of politicians in Belgium, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom.
Drawing from an exhaustive dataset of Facebook-posts published by over 500 Flemish (BE), Dutch and English (UK) politicians active on the national level (prime ministers, junior and senior ministers, MPs and party chairs) between 01/10/2020 and 31/01/2021, we selected all posts that contained a reference to an identifiable news item with pictures or links. This resulted in a dataset of 6022 unique news sharing Facebook-posts. This dataset, containing information on the post (e.g. sentiment, media criticism), the news article (e.g. outlet, topic), and the politician (e.g. party, function) will be analyzed to evaluate which of these factors affect user engagement (likes, comments and shares) with the post, and thus its reach through the politician in question. Building on previous research we expect the following findings: 
H1. User engagement is positively affected by a higher political function and a higher number of Facebook-followers.
H2. User engagement is positively affected by the positive and negative sentiment of posts (compared to neutral posts).
H3. User engagement is positively affected if the topic of the news article correlates with the politician’s issue ownership and issue specialization.

0,"In recent years, the scholarship on populism has displayed a growing interest in understanding the gendered aspects of (especially right-wing) populism. Scholars unpacked the types of femininity/masculinity propagated by extreme-right populism and how right-wing populism revers a hegemonic and uniform account of femininity/masculinity that obfuscates intersectional differences among women and men. Analyses have revealed how populism propagates a toxic masculinity (and a reactionary conception of femininity) and articulates its proper conceptualisation of sex, gender, and sexuality. Increasingly, scholars agree that gender performances are central to right-wing populist discourses and success. They under-gird extreme-right populism, making it central to its various articulations and successes (Eksi & Wood 2019). 
Clearly, the scholarship has made great strides in analysing the gender performances of extreme-right populists, understood as performances through which gender roles, norms, values, relations are constituted. What has received less scholarly attention, in contrast, is the gendered nature of these very performances; or the insight that the repertoires of performing available to politicians are, themselves, restrained by gender: prevailing gender norms greatly affect (facilitate and/or restrain) the type of instruments, styles and repertoires politicians have at their disposal. 
In our paper, we investigate the relationship between populists’ claims to authenticity (i.e. being one of the people) and their gendered performances (i.e. how the nature of their performances is itself gendered). Our aim is to come to a more fine-grained understanding of when and how gendered performances give purchase to politicians’ claims to authenticity. To this end, we attribute closer attention to politicians’ body or corporeal performances, and the ways in which their body is simultaneously an asset and a limit to their performances of authenticity.",Universiteit Antwerpen,Vrije Universiteit Brussel,,,,,,,Universiteit Antwerpen,,Petra Meier,Eline Severs,,,,,,,Petra Meier,,Democracy,Elites,Gender,Representation,,,,,Politicians’ authenticity: exploring the interplay between populist and gendered performances,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64475&EventID=185

0,"Since the Great Recession, the EU entered an edge of multiple global crisis that are reshaping the dynamics of integration. Within this tumultuous decade, the EU institutions established a wide range of policies to contain the effects of global crises on integration, by implementing regional policy making and initiative. The results of this “integration through policy-making strategy” showed to vary for characteristics and outputs (of the integration progresses). The reasons of these different outputs are still debated by the scientific community within the Grand Theories of European integration. Our research aims to contribute to this debate by focusing on the role of public support for EU integration though policy-making. We first present a theoretical framework on the dynamics linking the general public to political elites within the integration process during politicizations phases. We then analyze support for policy making to straight EU integration both at the elite and the general public level in the three main crises of the last decade: namely the Euro crisis, the refugee reception crisis and the SARS-COV2 pandemic. Data will be provided by cross-national mass and political elites surveys. Our preliminary results confirm a relationship between the public-elite alignment and the output of the integration policy.

0,"Research on decision-making in the World Bank has demonstrated that outputs are heavily politicized. The World Bank commits more money, approves more projects, ascribes fewer conditions, and enforces them less stringently when powerful principals—chief among them the United States (US)—have a geopolitical stake in recipient countries. While the politicization of the World Bank, and other International Financial Institutions, is well-established, much less is known about the drivers of this politicization. Many authors have hypothesized that the overrepresentation of the United States in voting shares and staff may be an important contributor to politicization. However, empirical evidence on the link between the overrepresentation of the US (passive representation) and its influence on operations (active representation) remains absent. The article makes two key contributions: First, it develops an argument that links passive representation of the US in voting shares, staff, and active representation in World Bank decision-making. Second, that argument is tested using novel data on the voting behavior of US executive directors, the nationality of key World Bank staff in charge of decision-making, and a survey experiment with World Bank staff members. The article ultimately shows how passive representation and bureaucratic culture combine to give the US a superior ability to influence World Bank conditionality design.

0,"The aim of this paper is to explore explanations to the level of politicization of different countries’ diplomatic services. Research on the politicization of the civil service has primarily mapped to what extent this phenomenon occurs on a general level. Somewhat more focus has been placed on appointments of ministerial advisors and director generals, but overall, we know very little of specific branches of the civil service. The level of politicization is likely to vary depending on the different kinds of activities and tasks of the public agencies, however. Ambassadors, who are heads of diplomatic missions, are for example politicized to some extent in several countries. Partly, because governments want to have a firm control over how their interests are represented abroad, but also because these prestigious positions can be used as rewards to political supporters. Apart from the US, however, there are few studies that map the actual levels of politicization of ambassadors and none that compare these levels between different countries and administrative systems. Thus, this study sets out to compare the level of politicized appointments of ambassadors in 19 countries (Sweden, Denmark, Iceland, Germany, USA, UK, Romania, Spain, Moldavia, Venezuela, Costa Rica, South Africa, Mozambique, Botswana, India, New Zeeland, Russia, Uzbekistan, and Azerbaijan) in 2019.

My point is that the minor involvement of politicized scholarship, rather than an occasional insensitive behavior, might have roots in how learning has refined its agenda.

To address this gap, this paper aims to integrate insights and concepts from policy studies, Political Science, and Science and Technology Studies to address political, policy and power aspects of AI. In particular, it aims to explore five topics. First, how AI and the concept of technology more broadly is understood and defined in politics and policy? Do instrumental understanding of technology as a tool to pursue economic and social aims dominate in AI policy and politics? Are political, social and cultural aspects of AI and technology recognized as well? Who defines AI and technology and what are broader implications of specific definitions and understandings? Second, what is the role of ideational and cognitive dimension in AI policy? What do ideational approaches such as socio-technical imaginaries, narratives, discourses, frames and policy scripts reveal about AI politics? Third, what manifestations of power do we encounter in AI politics and policies? How is power distributed among different actors such as government, companies and the public or employers and employees? How does power relate to intersectional characteristics such as race, gender or socio-economic status? Fourth, in a fast-developing area of AI policy and politics, what is relationship between change and continuity? Do novel ideas emerge or do we see strong path-dependences of established discourses? Fifth, how do intertwined local, national, regional and global processes play out in the field of AI politics and policy? Do we see policy learning and convergence or do diversity and divergence across national and regional policies dominate?

0,"In recent years, there has been an explosion of interest in polycentric governance among researchers and practitioners, from a variety of perspectives. In polycentric governance, multiple, overlapping decision-making units operate with a fair amount of autonomy, yet also evince a degree of coordination as they take one another into account in decision‐making processes. This study is part of a broader project comparing the policy performance of different kinds of polycentric governance in different empirical settings. In this project, we developed a framework for polycentric governance that is designed to improve knowledge cumulation by providing a guide for empirical inquiry. The framework builds on Ostrom’s Institutional Analysis and Development (IAD) framework.

We present the methods used, the geographic locations and levels that have been studied, the governance scales, and show trends how this literature has developed over time.

0,"Populists in the EU seek to promote various types of ‘sovereignist’ narratives about the EU (cf. Fabbrini 2021), i.e. a view of the EU as a weakly institutionalized set of institutions connecting a group of neo-nationalist sovereign states (see also Geva and Santos 2021). Yet, contrary to what sovereignist political leaders may wish for, it is not a given that the broad strata of the population in the EU member states would actually automatically embrace the state-centric narratives and frames when thinking about the Union. Other parameters and factors may be relevant when people conceptualize the Union and their participation in it, their experience of it and their expectations related to it. Building on an earlier study of “thought communities” in six EU member states (Bátora and Baboš 2020), the current paper uses relational class analysis (cf. Goldberg 2011) and analyzes perceptions of the EU as a political order by citizens in six selected member states. These include France, Germany, Italy, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia – three founding / large member states and three members of the Visegrad group (two of which represent the most notorious examples of the ongoing ‘sovereignist’ backlash). The analytical framework builds on the EU's three constitutional models as proposed by Fossum (2021) including a) the EU as a regional cosmopolitan government; b) the EU as an intergovernmental political order; and c) the EU as a federal union. Each of the constitutional models contains specific features depending on how the political order is configured along four different dimensions: decisional or law-making differentiation; competence-based functional differentiation; territorial differentiation; and citizen incorporation. Based on this, a survey is developed to test ‘thinking styles’ of the population in relation to the EU qua political order in the six selected member states. Target samples are 1000 respondents per country. Based on the above mentioned earlier study of ‘thought communities’, the assumption is that populist ‘sovereignist’ narratives about the EU do not (or only partially) match with the popular ‘thinking styles’ about the Union – even in countries with a ‘sovereignist’ government in power. By identifying transnationally distributed ‘thought communities’, the paper shows how is integration perceived and what are hence the popular pre-conditions for polity formation in a differentiated Union.","Department of Political Science, Comenius University Faculty of Arts","Department of Political Science, Comenius University Faculty of Arts",,,,,,,"Department of Political Science, Comenius University Faculty of Arts",,Jozef Batora,Pavol Babos,,,,,,,Pavol Babos,,European Politics,European Union,Differentiation,Euroscepticism,Survey Research,,,,Popular versus populist perceptions of the EU: Thought communities and pre-conditions for polity formation in a differentiated Union,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64645&EventID=185
0,"Why do people reject or support certain direct-democratic policy proposals? Previous research suggests that approval of political referendums arises because of proximity to policy positions. However, most studies do not take into account that political referendums are embedded in a complex process and different public opinions can influence approval or rejection as potential factors. In this study, we argue that, in addition to positional proximity to a referendum’s policy, approval or disapproval are influenced by party cues, expert cues, and cues on popular support. We expect that people are more likely to support a referendum if they are told that their party supports the project or that an non-favored party opposes the project. Furthermore, we expect the effect of expert cues and cues on popular support to differ between populist and non-populist citizens. Since populist citizens are more likely to be critical of science and supportive of enforcing the majority will, we expect them to be more likely to support a referendum if experts oppose the project and the public supports it. To test these assumptions, we conduct a conjoint experiment embedded in a novel survey. In addition to respondents' policy positions, party identification, and attitudes toward direct democracy, we measure individuals' populist attitudes. In the conjoint experiment, we randomize the policy proposal, the support and rejection of the proposal by political parties, the expert assessment of the proposal, and the public’s support for the proposal.

0,"Democracy is a system that aims to promote pluralism and resolve conflicts peacefully. Its essence lies in debate and active citizenship, but it also requires trust in political processes. Populism presents us with a paradoxical phenomenon: it invokes active citizenship but denies pluralism; it wants to bring people closer to politics but denies trust in representative institutions. Trust in rules and institutions is trust in democracy, and populism, by bringing every decision back to a hypostatized will of the people, is an expression of a generalized crisis of political trust.
One reason for this crisis is that politics has been overloaded with tasks and expectations, and politicians have suggested that these individual expectations should turn into rights that politics must realize. Failure to fulfill these promises has generated a widespread crisis of trust in politics itself. However, this generalized crisis has not led to more circumscribed expectations for political action but rather to the spread of populism. This does nothing but promises to fulfill the growing desires of the people, which populists claim have not been met because someone stands in the way of the popular will. 
Political trust is increasingly operating according to the simplistic dynamics of the perceived similarity between the leader and the people. In a society of communication technology and disintermediation, the ability to express personal opinions and the expectation of making an unmediated contribution to decision-making processes are expanding. The new populisms, by leveraging social media, convey a feeling of closeness between the leader and the people, as well as the illusion of rebuilding lost social cohesion. We are thus dealing with ambiguous and dangerous attempts to deny the “old” mechanisms of trust and to replace them with new (and technological) trust-building dynamics which seem to be more superficial and instinctive.",University of Pisa,,,,,,,,University of Pisa,,Antonio Masala,,,,,,,,Antonio Masala,,Populism,Communication,Technology,,,,,,Populism and political trust in the age of communication,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65817&EventID=185
0,"The support for populist radical right (PRR) parties has been on the rise over recent decades and has dramatically transformed the political landscape of Western European political systems. Not surprisingly, their emergence and electoral success has motivated a considerable amount of scholarly research. Most of the literature on the PRR, however, focuses on the national and supranational political levels, leaving the subnational level highly unexplored. This paper fills that literature gap by exploring the electoral strategies of PRR parties in substate elections and along the territorial dimension of political competition. To do so, we compare the political discourse of the Alternative for Germany (AfD) across German Länder since its first regional electoral success in 2014 until 2021. Unlike other authors who have focused on single cases or small-n comparisons using more qualitative approaches, we analyse party offer across a greater number of regions using quantitative content analysis data from the Regional Manifestos Project. Our main argument is that PRR parties adapt to the multi-level structure of the state and make electoral use of centre-periphery issues to find a niche for themselves. Preliminary empirical findings support our main hypothesis, showing evidence of AfD’s party manifesto heterogeneity in the centre-periphery dimension across German states. This article contributes to advance research in the area in different ways.

0,"Populist politicians have risen to power in several democracies in the last decade, based on an anti-establishment agenda and a claim to be the true representatives of the people. While the effects of populism on many areas of democracy have been well researched, scholars have only recently started to investigate the interplay between populism and the bureaucracy. Since populists in power need the advice and cooperation of their bureaucracy but strongly distrust it, how will a populist government deal with the bureaucracy? One important issue is what kind of professional competences populist governments will seek when appointing personnel to the bureaucracy. Based on their anti-elitist and anti-expert views and distrust of the bureaucratic establishment, we would expect populist governments to appoint bureaucrats with a different set of competences than other governments, that is, to put less emphasis on higher education and bureaucratic experience and greater emphasis on political experience and business background. The paper tests this argument in the context of U.S. presidential appointments to the bureaucracy. In the U.S., the president has the capacity to steer the federal administrative machine through the power to appoint up to 4000 positions, including leadership offices. The paper investigates how the professional backgrounds of presidential appointees to leadership offices differed between the Trump administration and the Obama and Bush administrations. To do so, it analyzes a self-compiled data set with biographical information on 374 appointees under these three administration. The analysis shows that Trump appointees were more likely to have political experience working for the presidential campaign and similar than both Obama and Bush appointees, more likely to have a business background than Obama appointees, less likely to have higher education than Bush","Departments of Political Science and Public Administration, Universiteit Leiden","Departments of Political Science and Public Administration, Universiteit Leiden",,,,,,,"Departments of Political Science and Public Administration, Universiteit Leiden",,Johan Christensen,Kutsal Yeşilkağit,,,,,,,Johan Christensen,,Democracy,Populism,Public Administration,,,,,,Populism and the professional backgrounds of U.S. presidential appointees,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65103&EventID=185
0,"The rise of populism in Western Europe is often explained as a mobilisation of the opposition against globalisation and supra-national integration. But the domestic-international divide is only one aspect of the more general question about the scalar organisation of government. In this paper, we explore the relationship between populist attitudes and orientations towards state scales more generally. Drawing on a representative survey of 4033 citizens in Britain, France, Germany and Switzerland, we show that populism entails preferences for those state territories viewed as ‘closer to the people’ not only in a metaphorical, but also in a scalar sense. This finding suggests that the rise of populism should not only be explained as a response to a crisis of party government in a context of globalisation. It is also a response to a crisis of national statehood resulting from restructuring processes in which the nation state has lost its role as a unifying energizer.",University of Zurich,Université de Lausanne,,,,,,,University of Zurich,,Daniel Kübler,Michael Strebel,,,,,,,Daniel Kübler,,Local Government,Populism,Regionalism,,,,,,Populism and the scales of statehood  in Western Europe,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63206&EventID=185
0,"Nowadays, the increase of internet use has led to the massive production of internet-based big data. The idea of the vast amount of unexploited information has motivated the academia, companies and institutions to search for the best practices to make the most out of this data. In most cases, data in big data environments (or data lakes) are not necessarily structured, meaning they do not follow a relational structure (i.e. tables with columns and rows). Most of the time they are unstructured or semi-structured. The most common form of unstructured data in the Internet is text. This has led to the development of innovative methods and practices by the scientific community for the effective and comprehensive extraction, transformation, visualization and analysis of text data, a field described as “text analytics”.

For the purposes of this paper we aim to study populism on social media (Twitter) and news websites, utilizing various text analytics methods and tools. We have chosen six Greek newspapers and we have collected articles from their websites and tweets posted by their official Twitter accounts in the same period of time. In this manner, we are able to compare the findings of media monitoring when we use two different data sources. 

At first, we collected tweets and news articles containing the stem words “people” and “popul”. Twittter data were collected through API requests and news websites’ data through web scraping. Then, we transformed the collected data into a tidy format and finally we stored the transformed data into a local database.

After that we used text cleaning methods in order to clean the data from much “noise” such as punctuation, stop words etc. and prepare them for analysis. Then we used a series of computer-based approaches for the proper classification of the articles as populist (or not), namely: sentiment analysis, word frequencies and an HITL machine learning algorithm. 

Our aim is to find the best available method that scholars could use for the automated detection of populism on the Internet, by highlighting the positives and negatives of each one. Also by comparing two different data sources (Twitter and websites) we show the differentiation in populist content someone could extract from those two.",Aristotle University of Thessaloniki,Aristotle University of Thessaloniki,,,,,,,Aristotle University of Thessaloniki,,George Makris,Ioannis Andreadis,,,,,,,George Makris,,Media,Populism,Social Media,,,,,,"Populism monitoring: web (text) data collection, cleaning and analysis.",https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65465&EventID=185
0,"Left-wing populist parties have been studied primarily through the prism of overarching approaches, using “cold” categories of analysis constructed on the basis of theoretical and expert criteria, and focusing on the leaders’ discourses. Few studies have focused on what the activists of these parties thought and had to say. Regarding La France insoumise (Unbowed France, LFI) and Podemos (We Can), the existing literature has (1) labelled them as populists; (2) highlighted their links with Ernesto Laclau and Chantal Mouffe’s populist theory which has become their new “theoretical reference”. In this article, I analyze how the adoption of populism as a new discourse and as a new ideology by the leaders of LFI and Podemos impacted the activists of both movements. I look at how the activists receive the leaders’ message and then mobilize it according to their own perceptions. I aim to answer the following questions: do activists re-mobilize the populist discourse and theoretical references of the leaders unchanged? Or is there a rejection of the leaders’ message, and strong intra-partisan “militant criticism” towards it ? To answer these questions, I conducted thirty-six semi-structured interviews  to allow for variation of the interviewees’ profiles (eighteen in Spain and eighteen in France). The interviews were conducted in the interviewees’ language (French/Spanish) between October 2019 and July 2020. I used a CAQDAS (NVivo) to analyze them. The analysis shows four main results. First, the activists develop a (minimal) populist discourse close to the discourse developed by the leaders of each party, as they emphasize both the importance of the people-elite axis and the desire for a radicalization of democracy. Second, the activists who identify with the left the most reject populism as a theoretical reference more easily, while activists who reject the left-wing identity referred to the populist theory more. Third, I drew up a typology of activists, I distinguished between converted activists (for whom populism is the main identity), pragmatic activists (who see populism as a strategy for winning votes in elections), ambivalent activists (who consider that populism is an interesting phase for gaining visibility but that it can be dangerous), and reluctant activists (who see populism as a danger because it blurs the lines with the extreme right). Fourth, I zoomed on the “converted” activists who brandish populism as a new identity, backed by a rhetoric and an ideological corpus. Most of them left LFI and Podemos considering that the restructuration of the left around populism  could not take place in their organizations because of the strong reluctance of part of well-integrated actors who belong to what they consider being the “old left”.",Universidad Complutense de Madrid,,,,,,,,Universidad Complutense de Madrid,,Laura Chazel,,,,,,,,Laura Chazel,,Comparative Politics,Democracy,Populism,Critical Theory,Activism,,,,Populism seen from below: reception and mobilization of populism as a discourse and as a theoretical reference by Podemos and La France insoumise activists,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64007&EventID=185
0,"The recent research on populism shows that media alone may deploy populist strategies, which can lead to the construction of social identity or activation of populist schema among its audience. This paper interprets how the alternative media in Slovakia depicted the demonstrations against the pandemic measures. Except for the oppositional politicians, these media were prominent protest mobilization actors. The demonstrations coverage published by three alternative online media, InfoWar, Magazine 1, and Why do media keep silent? during the period between October 2020 and November 2021 is followed. Overall, 107 articles are inductively coded and analyzed by employing discourse analysis. The results show that four main themes - alienation, antagonism, violence, and truth - anchor the media's discourse. These themes, and the codes they are made of, prove the populist style of the discourse. The media construct the protests as a moral battle between the people and the elites, which takes place in the context of several imminent crises – decay of democracy in Slovakia, human rights violations, and international pandemic complot. They radicalized the discourse over time as they openly incited their audience to civil unrest.

Moreover, the resistance to the reduction of fossil fuel emissions has become a major issue for populist and conservative parties in the country. Based on an original survey and using a multi-level regression model, we show the major role of ideology and political cues in public resistance to the reduction of fossil fuels. In contrast to the existing research, we point to the importance of contextual factors, namely the closeness to coal-fired powerplants that moderate the effects of political variables. However, the effects are dependent on the gender, education, and socio-economic status of respondents.

0,"Populism is now a truly global phenomenon, having an immediate impact on international politics. Under populist leadership, for example the US has withdrawn from the Paris Climate Accord and the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action and put significant pressure on the NATO alliance. Similarly, decision-making within the EU has become increasingly difficult as a result of populist parties rising to power in Hungary and Poland. 
To date, the study of the effect of populism on international politics has been limited to the (exploratory) empirical examination of particular populist regimes, mostly through general case studies based on data from existing scholarship. These studies categorize different types of populist parties, establish examples of the impact of specific populist regimes on foreign policy, and identify hypotheses for the impact of populism on foreign policy. Other studies focus on identifying what is uniquely ‘populist’ about these actors. Within this last category, scholars are working specifically on distinguishing between nationalist and populist discourse, often employed by the same actors. These studies approach the issue from either an ad hoc or an exploratory angle, lacking a solid theoretical foundation. To gain a broader perspective on the structural impact of populism on international politics, I argue that the application of insights from established IR and FPA theory is required.
In this article, I fill this gap by providing a structured analysis of the current state of the field, which results in a research agenda. I apply the insights from different strands of IR and FPA theorizing to the study of the impact of populism on foreign policy. Exploring what these theories can offer, the article identifies new directions for the field, and illustrates the usefulness of these directions with empirical examples. 
This article uses a mixed-methods approach. A quantitative analysis of the field will be used to show (a) to what extent populism and FP scholars engage with existing IR and FPA literature and (b) to produce a categorization of the publications in the field so far (for instance by their conceptions of populism, geographical focus, or the methodologies that are centered).

First, it examines how the populist swing of Romanian politics caused by the fight against the judiciary affected the identity politics of the Széklers. Second, this study examined how Hungary's nationalist kin-state enterprises to support the Hungarian cultural heritage in Széklerland influenced the discourse of Széklers and instilled FIDESZ's political viewpoints on illiberalism.

0,"What public intellectual roles do conservative academics play in this era of populist politics?  One measure of political activism by academics is their participation in think tanks external to the university. Vying with the media and universities, think tanks have come to exert tremendous amounts of symbolic power by helping to shape how policy makers, political leaders, and journalists understand the social world. They are prime sites where academics can exercise public intellectual roles. This paper identifies the think tank participation of 100 US conservative academics who supported the Trump presidency and continue to support Trumpism. The paper examines the network affiliations to major think tanks where these individuals try to influence the public agenda with their views in support of Trumpism. Most of these academic Trumpists hold professorships in mainstream research universities yet tend to be concentrated in just a few schools.  Moreover, they tend to be concentrated in just a few nationally important think tanks that project a narrow and extreme right-wing political ideological orientation. One such think tank stands out: the Claremont Institute in California.   This research invites cross-national comparisons with conservative European Academics who support right-wing populist movements and governments.

We analyze a) how the change of perceived socio-economic positiion during the pandemic and b) the perception of various aspects of the functioning of democracy affected populist attitudes among the public and public support for populist political parties. We expect that worsened perception of individuals‘ economic conditions and the decline in support for democracy leads to strengthening of populist attitudes voting for oppositional populist political parties.

0,"The Covid-19 pandemic and the resulting socio-economic crisis forced contemporary society to face its structural problems. As crises shed light on the solidity of the political and economic system, it is therefore certainly no coincidence that the greatest historical revolutions  - for better or for worse - occurred precisely in conjunction with them. 
The Covid-19 emergency forced us to move most of our activities online. This change also affected the political sphere, forcing leaders to rely more and more on social media platforms. In many democracies, this transition went hand in hand with the pre-existing populist wave, which already resorted to social media as its main communication tool.

The paper will analyze how Covid-19 has affected the way party leaders in Western Europe communicate with their voters (or may we say “followers”?) on social media, comparing posts of both populist and mainstream party leaders in Italy, UK and Spain.
In order to do so, we use what we define “four essential characteristics of Populism” (Chameleonic Nature; Manichean Dialectics, Anti-Elitism and Charismatic Leadership) as analytic categories to identify populist attitudes within the text, not only when it comes to rhetoric but also to studying the way certain political issues are discussed by political leaders and their parties.
The research is led through content analysis with the support of CrowdTangle. The program allows us to extract posts produced by the different leaders on their Facebook and Instagram profiles without time limitations. 
We analyze leaders’ posts published in contemporary to important political decisions at both national and European level, from 2018 onwards. The aim is to detect the shifting towards populist rhetoric after the beginning of Covid-19 pandemic in Europe in March of 2020.

The paper highlights how the pandemic pushed party leaders toward populist behaviors, even when they were not originally heads of populist parties. This can be traced to the intrinsic characteristics of social media, which only allow for a certain number of characters to be written and rely more on pictures than words. Because of this, leaders have to rely on more direct and impactful rhetoric to deliver their message to their followers. However, the “populist contagion” runs deeper than the mere use of communication techniques, and it could affect the way leaders (and, therefore, parties) deal with certain political and policy issues.","Dipartimento di Scienze Sociali, Università di Napoli Federico II",,,,,,,,"Dipartimento di Scienze Sociali, Università di Napoli Federico II",,Laura Minguzzi,,,,,,,,Laura Minguzzi,,Comparative Politics,Political Parties,Populism,Social Media,,,,,Populist Contagion: how Covid-19 led European leaders to use populist rhetoric on social media,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=66095&EventID=185
0,"Political leaders frame their responses to crises in different ways. The main focus of this paper is on the populist crisis communication of the Covid pandemic in Slovakia. In particular, how the populists in power presented the crisis when unpopular regulations needed to be adopted while maintaining the popular support of ‘the people’. A discourse-historical analysis is used to capture developments in the communication of crisis using a systematic analysis of all press conferences on the issue of Covid by Igor Matovic, PM of Slovakia at the time. The period covered is from February 2020 when he entered office until April 2021, when he was forced to step down after public pressure for mishandling the pandemic, which led to a coalition crisis. The paper argues that to address the negative progress of the pandemic, Matovic used several discursive strategies to legitimize his introduction of measures such as lockdown, social distancing or nationwide testing. The paper shows that these measures were brought in  relying on the use of three main frames to maintain popular support, namely “Blaming and scapegoating”, “The Leader of the people”, and “Common responsibility.” The first frame is used to identify different scapegoats or differentiate ‘the true people’ from others. The second frame represents the portrayal of the populist leader himself and can be divided into three sub-frames: “War fighter”, “Saviour of the people”, and “Responsible leader”. The last frame refers to the common responsibility and a need for people to protect themselves. Framing the pandemic this way, Matovic relied on the simplistic Manichean view of society and use of the image of the threat to ‘the people’ to rally support. He represents the will of the people, in this case, meaning that the regulations were framed for ‘the people’ and the protection of their health and lives. Yet, with the ongoing pandemic, the discursive frames changed as the crisis developed. The development of crisis communication strengthened divisions in society, increased polarization of ‘the people’ and ‘the others’, with the latter category progressively expanding. With regulations becoming more and more unpopular, Matovic responded with blame-shifting being more present and every person or group that disagreed with proposed rules became the target and reason for the worsening situation, and thus the enemy of the ‘true people’. It is these antagonistic politics and discursive practices that led to the coalition break-down, forcing Matovic to step down.",Central European University,,,,,,,,Central European University,,Veronika Budaiova,,,,,,,,Veronika Budaiova,,Media,Populism,Qualitative,Communication,,,,,Populist crisis communication: Presentation of Covid crisis in Slovakia by populist leaders in power,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64822&EventID=185
0,"The populism literature (Barr, 2019; Albertazzi and McDonnell, 2008; Laclau, 2011; Moffitt, 2016; Weyland, 2001, 2017; Diehl, 2019; Urbinati, 2019) often describes political leaders as essential actors in the emergence of populist politics. However, due to conceptual and operational uncertainties, there is no consensus whether charismatic leadership is a necessary element of populism (see, e.g. Mudde and Rovira Kaltwasser, 2014). The number of researches (Andrews-Lee, 2021; McDonnell, 2016) that focus on followers rather than leaders along Weberian conceptualization is relatively insignificant. To fill this gap in the literature, the article turns to the follower-centric models of generic leadership studies (Metz, 2021) for help, which examine citizens’ charisma attribution to leaders by stable and tried-and-tested conceptualization and toolbars (Aï et al., 2020). In short: following Weber's original theory (see Joosse, 2018; Willner 1985), we formulate charisma as an intimate and direct bond between leaders and followers in this article. Thus, we argue that a follower-centric approach that grasps charisma in the eyes of the followers is more than accurate.
In an original survey research, the article compares respondents’ populist attitudes (Akkerman et al. 2014; Castanho Silva et al. 2019; Kefford et al. 2021; Shultz et al. 2018), charisma attribution (Conger and Kanungo 1994; Shamir 1994) and general over-attribution of the importance of leadership in political, social and economic process (Meindl et al. 2007; Shamir 1994) through modified scales building on the literature. We will test three assumptions:
(1) Those followers who hold stronger populist attitudes are prone to perceive their leader as more charismatic compared to the challenger.
(2) They also show emotionally positive attachment to their leaders, while they have a negative charismatic relationship with the challenger.
(3) The stronger the populist attitude of the followers, the higher they evaluate the importance and impact of political leadership in general.
The novelty of the research is twofold. First, we do not just adapt measurements of generic leadership studies to political context, but we also develop two scales of charisma attribution distinguished perceived charismatic behaviour and positive/negative charismatic attachment. As a result, positive and negative charisma can be measured. Second, the research is the first venture which combines populist attitudes and charisma perceptions.

0,"This paper explores contemporary dynamics of tension and cohesion in Portuguese foreign policy. In order to do so we center our attention on the period of deep crisis the country went through in the context of the recent global financial meltdown and subsequent Eurozone crisis. The crisis strongly impacted the country’s domestic fabric and forced its leaders to search for urgent and innovative solutions, notably at the international level. Drawing on the literature on foreign policy (de)Europeanization, the paper examines the impact of the Eurozone crisis on Portuguese foreign policy. More precisely, it considers the extent and the ways the crisis affected preexisting patterns of Portuguese foreign policy Europeanization. This topic is significant because Portugal’s foreign policy went through a significant level of Europeanization in the past, although the depth of such process has varied for different geographical areas. Moreover, while economic or instrumental motivations have played an important part in its participation in the European Union, Portugal suffered greatly from the Eurozone crisis as a Troika country.

Using a qualitative case study research design, the purpose of our paper is to provide an in-depth account of the implications of the Eurozone crisis for preexisting patterns of Portuguese foreign policy Europeanization, asking specifically whether those past patterns continued to unfold or, instead, whether they were undermined or reversed. Relatedly the paper explores the underlying factors or possible drivers that might help explaining the identified patterns of Portuguese foreign policy (de)Europeanization. Possible changes in preexisting patterns of Portuguese foreign policy Europeanization are examined by looking at national discourses, processes and practices. The main focus is put on Portugal’s overall foreign policy orientation, in order to better apprehend the prevalent or more general repercussions of the crisis, in contrast to possible impacts in specific policy domains only.

0,"This paper explores the contested neo-nationalist trends in Europe and its impact on European higher education (Bieber 2018, Brack, Coman & Crespy 2019, Chernilo 2020, Gingrich & Banks 2006, Delanty 2021, López-Alves & Johnson 2019). It also examines recent actions taken by the EU to counteract these current trends. The presentation of this paper and the panel as such, is based on preliminary studies that allow us to see the emerging contours of how practices concerning the nation-state such as ‘timely risk-management’, ‘economic nationalism’ and ‘welfare state protectionism’ are involved in the creation and shaping of what may perhaps become a new ontology of the university.

The EU increased its strength with the Maastricht Treaty, three years after the fall of the Berlin Wall and one year after the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991. This tightening of the European integration process plays a crucial role for universities. On one hand, the tightening launched extensive higher education reforms (Brøgger 2019), and on the other hand became a breeding ground for new nationalisms opposing ‘the European project’, including the Brussels-based EU authorities of federal Europe. 

Born as international/European institutions in the Catholic Middle Ages and reborn as significant building blocks for the establishment of nation states and vehicles for forming national bureaucracies in the 19th century, Western universities have been at the forefront of both national development and European integration. This paper argues that the rise of new nationalisms in higher education (Brøgger 2021, Van der Wende 2021) is affiliated with post-Cold War readjustments occupied with asserting the nation’s right to intervene in and limit the agency of so-called autonomous and self-governing institutions under the nation-state. 

Taking a point of departure in an introduction to the research project ‘Asserting the nation. Comparative studies on the rise of neo-nationalism in higher education’ funded by the Independent Research Fund Denmark, this paper explores and discusses the various domains in which the new nationalisms seem to manifest in higher education. Overall, the domains seem to concern the autonomy and governance of the university and includes new practices in domains such as freedom of research and international engagement, practices concerning how and to what degree national politicians or governments influence, intervene in or restrict i) the freedom of research and ii) universities’ ability to engage with the international community. The presentation will reflect on both aspects drawing on studies on Danish higher education and the EU. The studies are still ongoing and based on extensive document analysis and interviews with policy officials from the Directorate General for Education and Culture, the Education, Audiovisual and Culture Executive Agency, the Eurydice network, members of the European Parliament, the European Commission and NGO’s such as the EUA, officials of various ranks from the department and agency level of The Danish Ministry of Higher Education and Science, and management and faculty members from two Danish universities.",Aarhus Universitet,,,,,,,,Aarhus Universitet,,Katja Brøgger,,,,,,,,Katja Brøgger,,European Union,Nationalism,Higher Education,,,,,,"Post-Cold-War governance arrangements in Europe: the university, the nation state, and international polities",https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64649&EventID=185
0,"The collapse of the USSR led to both enthusiasm and anxieties, inside and outside the former Soviet space. However, it could be argued that the psychological impact of the fall was particularly colossal on what was to be the Russian Federation: in just a matter of days, the Russians – notably the leadership and elite – were forced to at least acknowledge that they were no longer rulers over a transcontinental empire which had also been the gravitational centre for numerous satellites. This led to a heavy feeling of insecurity and weakness. Arguably the most painful dimension was that the Russians felt that their international status was severely deteriorated and that the Russian state was, at best, considered to be a regional power, which was a major plunge from the status of one of the only two world superpowers. Hence, there were changes recorded on multiple layers: modified territory and population, a new regime was struggling to draw its face, different perceptions of the Russian state on regional and international level. These all led to a notable identity crisis whose clarification was crucial not only for dealing with the inherent economic crisis, but also for the future of the Russian state itself and its relations with the international community.
Under these coordinates, the first elected Russian leader, president Yeltsin embarked upon the arduous task of declaring to the domestic and international public who and what Russia was. A brief look into his rhetoric unveils how, on the one hand, the new type identity president Yeltsin described would have made Russia a member of the democratic club; on the other hand, the role identity turned out to be problematic. While the president proclaimed Russia to have dropped its imperialist desires and the newly created CIS was a voluntary structure based on principles such as equality of states, it was also him to declare in 1994 that “Russia is the first among equals, it’s the gravitational centre of brotherly-states”, hinting at the past, rather than a new role identity for the new Russian state. Considering these preliminary observations, the paper aims to address the questions: How did president Yeltsin describe Russia’s personal identity? How did the president describe the system that was developing in the Federation? What role did Yeltsin envision for Russia? And, ultimately, how did the leader attempt to postulate a collective identity for the former Soviet space? These are all crucial aspects to investigate in order to understand not only the specificities of the 1990s, but also the current Russian system and its relations with the former Soviet states, especially with Ukraine. Analysing the president’s rhetoric with the help of discourse analysis and interpreting the main ideas Yeltsin presented to the public through the filter presented by the constructivist theory of IR are valuable tools in the endeavour of offering pertinent answers to the above questions and establishing whether the leader contoured a new national identity for Russia or added yet another link in the millennial imperialist Russian identity.",University of Bucharest,,,,,,,,University of Bucharest,,Iulia Mustatea,,,,,,,,Iulia Mustatea,,Foreign Policy,International Relations,National Identity,Constructivism,Identity,,,,Post-communist Russian Identity Crisis and its (Re)Definition as Transpired in President Yeltsin’s Rhetoric,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65061&EventID=185
0,"Post-New Public Management (NPM) thrives in worldwide bureaucracies. However, the practices of the post-NPM pattern are diverse due to the different politico-administrative institutions in each country. Specifically, the rise of populist activities impedes the neutrality of bureaucracy in policy implementation, and concurrently becomes one of the important driving forces in the bureaucratic reforms. By comparing the public reform in China with those in the main advanced industrialized countries after the 2010s, this paper examines the similarities and differences of the post-NPM reform practices from an institutional perspective. It explores the institutional impacts of populism on the post-NPM reforms in terms of historical context, component, implementation method, reform focus and phase, politico-administrative relationship, and value differentiation in China and the main advanced industrialized countries. 

(Note: core argument and data: The divergences between these influential post-NPM reforms are treated as the results of the path-dependent impacts of the original rules on the new post-NPM elements from a historical-institutionalist perspective. It is based on a three-actor model: (1) political rule makers, (2) bureaucratic rule takers, and (3) social context. The rule makers in bureaucratic reforms are embedded in a concrete historical context that is broadly influenced by populism. Populism is to be discussed as a part of social contentious movement due to the preceding market-centred, capitalist system. In the post-NPM reform, rule makers utilize the populist ideas to re-hierarchize the public-sector organizations after de-hierarchizing bureaucracies in the preceding NPM reform. Populism acts as both deconstructive and constructive dynamics in bureaucratic reforms. The data collections are mainly from the official Chinese documents and from the OECD iLibrary. The secondary sources are the academic works on comparative public reforms and institutionalism.)",Vrije Universiteit Brussel,,,,,,,,Vrije Universiteit Brussel,,Shuai Qin,,,,,,,,Shuai Qin,,China,European Politics,Populism,Public Administration,USA,Comparative Perspective,,,Post-NPM under Populism – A Comparative Analysis of Bureaucratic Reforms in China and Advanced Industrialised Countries,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63486&EventID=185
0,"Populist parties have long enjoyed a dominant position in Slovak politics. Support for such forces can be explained by multiple factors, including nostalgia for state socialism, nationalistic sentiment, and the repudiation of the political elites and (neo)liberalism in general. The aim of this paper is to identify the most significant populist actors in Slovakia, and to explore their influence on domestic economic policy over time. The foundations of populist policy making in Slovakia are found to rest on two pillars. First, the failure to resist the lures of short-termism undermines fiscal responsibility: the costs of redistributive policies are usually imposed on future generations. Second, the distrust of markets and the institutions of capitalism prompts populists to offer alternatives in the form of popularity-seeking rhetoric or measures with distortionary effects; reforms of the pension system constitute a prime example. Such alterations and other country-specific variations are evaluated through indicators on macroeconomy and human geography, while an overview of the personalized patterns of Slovak capitalism is also provided. Besides analysing the Fico cabinets (2006-2018), an emphasis is placed in the conclusion on how the current Slovak government, which comprises two populist parties, has addressed the social and economic implications of the COVID-19 pandemic and the issue of corruption, since anti-corruption fight was the political case along with the coalition had been formed in 2020.",Corvinus University of Budapest,,,,,,,,Corvinus University of Budapest,Corvinus University of Budapest,Bence Bánki,,,,,,,,Bence Bánki,István Kollai,Europe (Central and Eastern),Policy Analysis,Political Economy,Populism,,,,,Post-peasant populism: the case of Slovakia,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65844&EventID=185
0,"The need to regulate post-public office careers of former Members of Parliament (MPs) and ministers is increasingly acknowledged by countries. While regulations concerning post-ministerial careers have been established for a longer period of time, many countries also set up rules to guide post-parliamentary careers of former MPs. Consequently, a wide variety of regulations exists which set different standards for restricting and reporting post-public office employment. This paper uses newly collected data to categorize and analyse existing regulations that target MPs and ministers across GRECO member states. The main research question is ‘what factors explain the existence of post-public office career regulations of former MPs and ministers?’. After mapping the existing regulations in these countries, the paper tests the effect of institutional factors relating to the political system (such as the party system) as well as factors relating to the level of clientelism and patronage to explain the variation. The paper also discusses the normative implications of these regulations.","Departments of Political Science and Public Administration, Universiteit Leiden",,,,,,,,"Departments of Political Science and Public Administration, Universiteit Leiden",,Tim Mickler,,,,,,,,Tim Mickler,,Elites,Parliaments,Political Parties,,,,,,Post-public office career regulations: A comparative analysis,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64830&EventID=185
0,"This paper presents early work on the media strand of the new AHRC-funded project ‘Post-Socialist Britain? Memory, Representation and Political Identity amongst German and Polish Immigrants in the UK’. The project explores connections between collective memory and political identity in the process of migration, with a particular focus on countries with experience of state socialist rule. ‘Post-Socialist Britain?’ takes as its point of departure the growth in support for anti-immigrant, radical right and Eurosceptic parties across Europe. This phenomenon has frequently been explained in these contexts as underpinned by collective memory of authoritarianism. Yet, those who give such explanations usually assume that those remembering authoritarianism do so in their country of origin. Using the case studies of German and Polish migrants in the UK, Post-Socialist Britain? breaks out of this national mould to explore if and how memory is linked to political identity when the individual moves to a new national context.

The media strand of the project seeks to understand the discursive space in which Germans and Poles in the UK construct their political identities and how this might interact with memories of the country of origin. The public sphere is important for political identity: it is a space for democratic participation and solidarity but also a space of exclusion of marginalised groups. How far and in what way post-socialist migrants are addressed and can participate as members of the political community therefore becomes key. Using narrative frame analysis, we explore representations of German and Polish history and German and Polish migration in the most widely read online broadsheet and tabloid UK newspapers at key moments between 2014-2019. 

We focus on the question how representations of history and migration interact to create very different images of Poland and Germany that Poles and Germans in the UK encounter and respond to in negotiating their identities as migrants. In narratives on history, both Germany and Poland are mainly connected to World War II – the former as perpetrator, the latter as victim and as setting where events take place, rather than an actor. In relation to migration, Germany appears mainly as policy-maker and as receiver of migrants, whereas Germans as migrants are rarely discussed – although there have been some articles looking at the effects of Brexit on Germans in the UK. By contrast, Poles are mainly portrayed as migrants to the UK, rather than Poland being seen as an actor in international politics or a receiving country. Through our analysis, we explore the extent to which national histories are mediatized in ways that take into account the UK’s diverse patterns of migration.",University of Birmingham,University of Birmingham,,,,,,,University of Birmingham,,Maren Rohe,Charlotte Galpin,,,,,,,Maren Rohe,,Media,Migration,National Identity,Memory,Narratives,,,,Post-Socialist Britain?

0,"In the last decades, just war theory has dominated philosophical debates on justice after war. Its proponents are often interested in the analysis of the rights and responsibilities of victors once the violent conflict is over (Bass 2004; Bellamy 2008; McCready 2009; Orend 2008; 2002; Patterson 2012; Walzer 2012; Johnson 2012; Pattison 2015). This is often perceived as one of the latest developments in just war theory. US-led invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan and subsequent state-building operations, for instance, are normally regarded as archetypical scenarios of justice after war. The idea of justice after war in this framework is grounded on a sharp distinction between ‘just victors’, on the one hand, and ‘unjust aggressors’ or ‘inherently murderous regimes’ defeated on the battlefield, on the other. There has been, more recently, a growing interest in this normative framework with the development of new works on the interplay between victory and war (O’Driscoll 2020a; 2019; 2020b; Patterson 2017; Hom, O’Driscoll, and Mills 2017). 

The interest in the problems of justice after war, however, is not entirely new. In fact, it finds its historical roots in seminal debates on the rights and responsibilities of colonial and imperial powers in just war theory. In this paper, I trace back the origins of this focus on post-war questions to the connection between modernity and coloniality as two sides of the same intellectual tradition of political thought. Drawing on some of the decolonial accounts of just war theory (Mbembe 2019, chap. 1; Hutchings 2019; Whyte 2018; Cavallar 2008; Bohrer 2018; Mares 2020), I argue that an image of a ‘just victor’ with the moral responsibility to punish, protect and educate its enemies is not only of historical interest but it also influences some of the ideas of justice after war in their contemporary form. One eloquent example of this in just war theory is the analysis of the ‘rehabilitation’ and ‘territorial occupation’ of defeated enemies once the smoke clears. 

The paper is divided into three sections. The first section reconstructs and critically evaluates what I call here ‘the paradigm of victory’ in just war theory and its idea of justice after war. This notion revolves around the rights and responsibilities of victors in the aftermath of war. In the second section, I outline some of the decolonial critiques to just war theory and its colonial and imperial influences in modern times. This line of criticism calls into question the humanitarian origins and altruistic interests often associated with the notion of just wars. The third section assesses whether this critical interpretation sheds some light on contemporary ideas of justice after war. I illustrate my conclusion in this last section with the debate on the ‘rehabilitation’ and ‘territorial occupation’ of defeated enemies in just war theory. This paper is, most importantly, an invitation to reflect on the historical baggage of just war theory and our potential to imagine justice after war otherwise.",University of Edinburgh,,,,,,,,University of Edinburgh,,Camilo Andres Ardila Arevalo,,,,,,,,Camilo Andres Ardila Arevalo,,Political Theory,War,Normative Theory,Peace,,,,,"Post-war Justice, Victory and Coloniality",https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63112&EventID=185
0,"The study of legislative voting behavior almost exclusively focusses on national legislatures and the European Parliament. A large part of political decision-making however takes place in decentralized government bodies. Furthermore many countries have decentralized powers and tasks to regional and local government. At the same time political scientists have only very limitedly studied legislative behaviour at those levels and in particular on legislative voting in municipal behaviour in municipal councils. This paper will bring the study of legislative voting behaviour to the local level by analyzing voting behaviour in around sixty municipal councils during the 2014-2018 term in the Netherlands.

Earlier research on legislative voting behaviour has found that coalition-opposition dynamics and the left-right axis form the most important factors that structure voting behaviour. As for the Netherlands both the voting results for around a fifth of the municipal councils has been collected through webscrapping and data on coalition participation and the local manifesto positions of nearly every elected party are available it is possibly to test whether the explanations that have been derived in the study in national parliaments also hold up for politics on the local level. The question under what conditions and to what extent voting behaviour is structured by the left-right axis and/or coalition/opposition dynamics will be analyzed by combining a multilevel regression analysis with a dyadic dataset. This approach makes it possible to test in what proportion variables explain the result. 

Besides broadening the area in which legislative voting behaviour is studied the choice to focus on local governments in a single country also makes it possible to study multiple legislatures with uniform institutions and rules. That makes it possible to compare votes directly.","Departments of Political Science and Public Administration, Universiteit Leiden",,,,,,,,"Departments of Political Science and Public Administration, Universiteit Leiden",,Thijs Vos,,,,,,,,Thijs Vos,,Elites,Local Government,Parliaments,Political Parties,Coalition,Decision Making,Domestic Politics,Big Data,"Power or Ideology?

0,"This paper takes a multi-level perspective on ongoing socio-technical transitions in precision livestock farming in order to identify the influence of power relations on actors’ identities. While the multi-level perspective is an established lens for explaining long-term technology development that has been applied in the agri-food context for over a decade, there are also well-known critiques pointing to a niche-focused bottom-up approach with a lack of emphasis on incumbent regimes and an absence of agency at the landscape level altogether (Geels 2011; Smith and Stirling 2010). We build on recent work addressing these issues (Contesse et al. 2021; Derwort et al. 2021) as well as on a spatial contextualization of the multi-level perspective (Coenen et al. 2012) and argue that both matters, the (co-) creation of environments and their location within a multi-level system.
To illustrate our argument, we study the case of a novel technology for pasture grazing systems. Virtual fencing represents one among several technologies developed in precision livestock farming (Bos et al. 2018) using GPS-based collars to track grazing animals on pastures and keep them within virtual borders signaled when approached. Despite their considerable history of evolution (Umstatter 2011), virtual fencing is far from mainstreamed and still in an early stage of adoption in only a few cases (Norway, New Zealand). How does this socio-technical transition change power relations and the actors’ associated scopes for action? How do institutionalized power relations manifest in supporting or hampering conditions for the development of virtual fencing? Based on data from expert interviews, group discussions and participatory co-creation workshops, we answer these questions from a multi-level perspective for the ongoing development of virtual fencing in two German grassland farming regions as comparative cases and discuss the implications of our results for the analysis of power and legitimacy as political science key categories.

Absent other intervening variables, therefore, power shifts generate dyadic security dilemmas in which each side is incentivised to contain, retard, and ideally destroy the other’s ability to harm them. But of course, all else is not “held equal”, and there always are intervening variables of at least some kinds.

0,"Why do foreign aid providers invest in large-scale electricity projects in nationally disputed urban territories (“divided cities”), and how do the rival sides of the city perceive such projects? While there are multiple motivations for a third-party to assist in developing modern infrastructure in active urban conflict zones, literature on foreign aid tends to frame such programs as attempts to either strengthen the authority of the host government over the area (e.g. UN aid to Lebanon, Mali, Democratic Republic of the Congo), or promote integration between former warring parties (e.g. EU aid for East-Berlin, Mitrovica, Belfast). In this paper we focus on foreign-backed energy projects that seek to weaken, rather than strengthen, the host government's control over a disputed urban area as a peacebuilding strategy. Through the case of East-Jerusalem, we examine how and why does the European Union invest in solar electricity projects to strengthen the energy independence and cultural autonomy of the city’s Palestinian neighborhoods by taking them “off the Israeli grid”, thus preserving a possibility for a future division of the city, and why local Israeli authorities accept their involvement despite perceiving them as hostile to their long-term national goals.
To explain this puzzle, we focus on the constant discrepancies created between the day-to-day energy needs of the residents in a “divided city” and the broader national goals of the sovereign that controls it. We argue that in the context of nationally divided cities, the municipal and state levels of authority to set the city’s governance often clash with the national goals of the residents who refuse to expect their authority, creating incoherence in policy. This leads to a slow and drawn-out process to approve infrastructure projects designed to improve municipal services and the quality of life for the city’s residents, raising the risk for civil disobedience that may “spill-out” to the rest of the city. This process opens space for foreign actors to intervene in meaningful arenas and offer immediate and convenient solutions both for city’s officials and its embattled residents by serving as a “buffer” between them. In doing so, these actors can shape the political status-quo of the city through electricity infrastructure. 
To advance its argument, this paper examines the involvement of several European Union bodies in the development of East-Jerusalem’s solar electricity infrastructure in the past decade. Through Israeli government and municipal protocols, combined with two dozen interviews with EU representatives and ambassadors, municipal officials in Jerusalem, and Palestinian energy consumers, we flesh-out the puzzle of how third-parties utilize electricity projects to promote national goals in ongoing urban conflict areas.",The London School of Economics & Political Science,Bar Ilan University,,,,,,,Bar Ilan University,,Lior Herman,Elai Rettig,,,,,,,Elai Rettig,,Conflict Resolution,Development,Green Politics,Policy Analysis,Investment,Energy,Energy Policy,,Powering the Divided City: European involvement in renewable electricity projects in East Jerusalem as a Peacebuilding Strategy,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=62322&EventID=185
0,"Feelings of financial insecurity and precarity among the squeezed middle classes are often evoked in discussions on the recent rise of populism in Europe. However, there is a dearth of systematic research on their role in this process. This study fills this gap by theorizing about and empirically linking three aspects of subjective insecurity – the precarity of work conditions, job tenure insecurity, and financial insecurity – to populist outlook and the voting for populist parties. We analytically separate subjective insecurity from the objective economic status and hypothesize that it is has a positive association with an individual’s populist mindset/outlook. Such a mindset is likely to translate into voting for populist parties.

Our analyses use the 2018 European Voting Election Study and include respondents in 10 European countries. To connect insecurity to populist outlook, we build survey-based measures of subjective insecurity and populist attitudes and conduct regression analyses, while controlling for the level of income, overall economic activity, and a number of socio-demographic variables. To connect subjective insecurity to voting for populist left and populist right parties, we build multinomial logit models of vote intentions. 

We find a positive association between the precarity of work conditions and populist attitudes and between financial precarity and populist attitudes in all our cases. These factors also explain Populist Radical Right and Populist Radical Left voting in all cases except the vote for populist right parties in Poland, Hungary, and Italy. Among the dimensions of precarity, financial insecurity and the precarity of work conditions are particularly significant, while the precarity of job tenure provides mixed results, which suggests the need to investigate populist outlook and voting through broader measures of insecurity beyond the risks of losing one’s job, those that can be applied to the squeezed middle classes.

Thirdly, the main informal and formal means used by the Moldovan president will be identified to measure the level of success of presidential activism in these issues. This approach will underline the main similarities and differences with other Presidents in the post-Soviet space.

0,"Traditionally, patterns of presidential popularity (approval) have mainly been studied in the context of classical presidential regimes such as the U.S. and Latin American countries, and we therefore lack systematic empirical research on presidential popularity in other regime types. This paper addresses the gap by comparing presidential popularity in European semi-presidential regimes and presidential (and possibly parliamentary) regimes in the 21st century. Utilizing national public opinion surveys and relevant contextual data, it examines whether the level of presidential popularity varies between the regime types and if it does, could the strength of the presidency explain some of the variation. Overall, presidents are usually more popular than other politicians, and in the context of semi-presidential regimes, this might be explained by their limited constitutional powers and role above party politics. In presidential regimes, on the other hand, presidents usually possess quite considerable powers and the public might be more judgmental towards the presidents’ actions. This paper thus assumes that higher level of presidential popularity is connected to more moderate role of the president. In addition, popularity ratings should be more unstable when the president is the main political leader of the country.

the head of state plays a central and independent role in one very important area of the Israeli political system: the process of government formation.

This paper explores the strategies that the Presidents of Israel have adopted to structure processes of government formation including the organization of formal and informal meetings with party groups and party leaders, interpreting the latter’s recommendations about who should be entrusted to form the next government, and deciding when to grant the formateur an extension and for how long.

Some of these investigations have dealt the subject from a comparative point of view, identifying and analyzing the consequences of the democratization experienced by political parties (Kenig, Rahat and Hazan, 2015; Sandri, Seddone and Venturino, 2015; Cross et al., 2016; Sandri and Seddone, 2021), there are even those who have focused exclusively on the study of open primaries, pointing to them as a possible new international standard (Lefebvre and Treille, 2019). For the Spanish case, there are some seminal studies (Barberá, Lisi and Rodríguez Teruel, 2015; Astudillo and Detterbeck, 2020), but many of the questions that can offer us a complete vision of the phenomenon have not yet been answered. Are there differences in participation between the selection of leaders versus that of candidates? And between games? At what levels, local, regional or national is where they are most celebrated? To what extent has selection by primaries become widespread? Does the fact that the people in charge present themselves to these processes influence participation? How many are the outsiders who end up winning the election? what is the level of competitiveness? Is there a gender gap? Are they really participatory processes or do they simply serve to legitimize strategic decisions? How has the digitalization of the parties affected the primary processes?

As teachers are under stress of a heavy workload and as politics can be a demanding topic to teach, there seems to be a great interest among teachers for such resources that are sometimes available online, sometimes by visits. These actors thus represent an outsourcing of citizenship education, and in Norway a group of seven such private citizenship education centers (CECs) have made a contract with the national government to provide such educational resources to schools. These centers  shape citizenship education. 
Such centers enter the field in a situation where competing conceptions of citizenship education are up against each other. The disciplinary tradition, the state centered political education approach, the emphasis on students and their life worlds and a focus on deliberative skills are four such  approaches (Fallace 2017, Christensen 2015). Across such different approaches is also a growing divide between a traditional rationalistic approach and an approach more focused on emotions, empathy, and personal experience. There is also a basic divide between on the one hand, critical approaches to policies and political institutions, and on the other, system legitimacy and socialization. Who do the CECs position themselves in this field of tensions?
Theories of privatization assumes that private service provision implies more adaption to user preferences and may lead to commodification. It is thus assumed that as these centers depend on teachers seeing them as helpful in motivating students, and on positive student evaluations, they will be more inclined to emphasise the emotional and subjective, and that they will focus on citizenship education as related to personal experiences of young people. But it could also be the other way around, as these centers specialize in citizenship education it could be that their approaches are more systematic and thorough than what teachers with too many tasks and sometimes weak didactical training can manage.
CECs depend on being visible and accessible online in order to attract teachers. It can therefor be assumed that their websites offer substantial empirical data that can be analysed. This paper presents the results of such an analysis.

0,"To what extent are individuals willing to help others during the pandemic and how is this influenced by their religiosity, political trust and political orientation? The pandemic might have affected the pro-sociality towards out-groups. On the one hand, one could argue that inter-religious boundaries are more salient during the pandemic. On the other hand, religion also has the potential to unmake prejudice and lead to increased solidarity especially during a pandemic. This paper examines pro-social attitudes among 7,000 residents in Britain, Ireland, Germany, Serbia and Sweden by showing a fictitious scenario of an older neighbor who needs his groceries to be picked up from a nearby supermarket due to cocooning. Respondents were asked to indicate their willingness to help. The online survey experiment follows a 3x2x2 factorial design varying the ethno-religious origin of neighbors signaled by the name (Alexander vs. Mohammed), the length of their residence (< 1 year, 10 years, entire life) and if groceries, or groceries and beer need to be collected. We assess the role of religion, political orientation, trust, health, and a range of socio-demographic variables. Generally, individuals who show lower levels of trust into political institutions and display a stronger tendency towards the political right are less willing to help. As a result, we find that the pandemic has left the vulnerable more vulnerable, i.e. those of minority origin and those who have spent less than a year in a country and would probably need the support the most. However, there are national differences with Germany and Serbia penalizing neighbors of different ethno-religious origin most consistently, and Ireland and Britain the least. In Sweden, the solidarity with Mohammed who lived his entire life there is not significantly different from the solidarity with a native. Overall, religiosity turns out to decrease the willingness to help a neighbor named Mohammed particularly in Ireland and Sweden but not in other countries. This suggests that in states which tend to be located at the ends of the secular-religious spectrum, religious out-group boundaries are more salient. Overall, our results demonstrate the salience of boundaries between ethno-religious groups.",University College Dublin,,,,,,,,University College Dublin,,Sarah Carol,,,,,,,,Sarah Carol,,Migration,Political Psychology,Religion,Political Sociology,Immigration,Solidarity,Survey Experiments,,Pro-social attitudes towards ethno-religious out-groups during the COVID-19 pandemic: A survey experiment in five countries,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=62721&EventID=185
0,"This contribution interrogates the largely undiscussed assumptions about positionality embedded within the scholarship about the ‘local turn’ in transitional justice (TJ) by asking the question, what happens when context-based academics and practitioners, otherwise designated as ‘the local’, are acknowledged as producers of knowledge about conflict, atrocity, and justice? By posing this question, this paper aims to examine the problematic ways that the ‘local turn’ in (TJ) ends up reducing, simplifying, trivialising, and erasing, the rich, context-based, and complexly political processes of knowledge production that occur within (post)conflict settings. While driven by noble attempts at decentring western perspectives on international criminal law, Eurocentric ideas about justice, conflict, and democratic turns, the scholarship that has emerged within ‘the local turn’ insufficiently reflects upon the sort of positionality that transpires in the labelling and category ‘the local’, in TJ. Furthermore, this author argues that ‘the local’ is a largely undefined and general concept which inherently conveys a sense of interchangeability of whatever the concept subsumes. As such, whatever is designated as being ‘the local’ is stripped of its depth and nuance. Finally, conceptualising experiences of violent conflict experiences, and visions of justice as ‘the local’, not only perpetuates colonial visions of places and peoples as ahistorical, but also fails to turn the attention away from finding a purer and more representative ‘local’, to the politics of southern and northern co-production and the ways that they inflect the kind of knowledge about (post)conflict contexts that is produced. Given that the ‘local turn’ has been largely the concern of North-based academics studying (post)conflict contexts in the Global South, the question of positionality is central to problematising ‘the local’ as a dominant way of knowing in TJ.",University of Cambridge,,,,,,,,University of Cambridge,,Lyn J.-V.

0,"Shifts in voting patterns in Western European democracies have recently been connected to the ongoing transformation of the way election campaigns are fought, with more and more of it taking place online, especially via social media. The ‘permanent campaign’ logic that characterises digitalised campaigns has urged parties to adapt by reforming their organisational structures and further professionalising their communication. Previous research has focused on the profile of communication staff, questioning their degree of partisanship and professionalisation. But what is their level of autonomy and what does the overall coordination of tasks look like? To what extent do these tasks and roles vary across parties? And finally, how do parties’ organisational strategies influence their effective online communication? This paper proposes to answer these questions through a mixed-methods approach combining qualitative interviews with the digital communication staff of Belgian parties with a content analysis of social media data. We analyse the relationship of digital communication staff with the party hierarchy and find that respondents’ perceived level of autonomy is related to questions of resources, party discipline, size, and ideology. The analysis of social media content supplements these findings and shows that mainstream parties are present on a wide array of platforms whereas challenger parties are more engaging, in part due to their grassroot approach to online communication. Overall, our mixed approach enables us to better grasp the relationship between party organisation and campaign digitalisation.",Université Libre de Bruxelles,,,,,,,,Université Libre de Bruxelles,,Lucas Kins,,,,,,,,Lucas Kins,,Cyber Politics,Political Parties,Advertising,Campaign,Internet,Communication,,,Professionalized digital campaigns?

0,"Infrastructure policy requires transformation in order to meet the objectives of climate and environmental protection. For this purpose, long-term (inter)national policy programs are elaborated and implemented to change the relevant sectors for decades. With the Deutschlandtakt, German transport policy has launched a policy program designed to significantly increase the attractiveness of rail transport. The program was developed and put on the political agenda by a small group of stakeholders who are not directly involved in policymaking. Today, the program is supported by various actors from politics, administration, business and associations, and was set as a goal in the German government's recent coalition agreement. Using the Programmatic Action Framework (PAF), this paper examines the actors who led this change, what binds them together, and how their joint promotion of the policy program can be explained. In doing so, we focus on the role of biographical intersections, institutionalized forums, and a resulting programmatic identity for their cooperation. Methodologically, this is done through document and media analyses, biography analyses, and narrative interviews. The paper identifies the actor network behind the Deutschlandtakt and shows that pre-existing shared social identities can be a key factor in the formation of a programmatic identity.",TU Braunschweig,Universität Bern,TU Braunschweig,,,,,,TU Braunschweig,,Nils C.

0,"When and how do voters respond to group targeted pledge (non-)fulfilment? While research on the reasons why pledges are (not) fulfilled has been growing in the last couple of years, voters' reactions to government pledge fulfilment is still understudied. Previous research on citizens' retrospectively oriented reactions has mainly focused on studying the effects of a government's performance (sociotropic or egocentric) unrelated to election pledges. While there is initial evidence that voters punish governments for breaking their pledges, we still lack knowledge to which kind of pledges voters respond in a positive or negative way. We acknowledge the growing importance of group targeting and mobilization, i.e., the fact that parties make election pledges addressing specific groups of voters positively or negatively, such as business owners or migrants. We argue that two factors affect how voters react to the fulfilment of targeted election pledges: 1) their perceived deservingness of the target group and 2) their individual belonging to that group. To assess how voters respond to group targeted pledge (non-)fulfilment, we rely on a survey experiment based on real broken or fulfilled election pledges conducted during the election campaign for the 2021 legislative elections in Germany and for the 2022 presidential election in France (N = 12,000). We study voters’ reactions at different levels: specific support (performance evaluation of government and voting) as well as diffuse support (political trust and democratic satisfaction).

0,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms have become a prominent tool to govern many aspects of our public life. Despite its efficiency and the promise of enhanced public policies, the use of AI is not neutral. There is a current flood of conflicting scientific evidence related to the utilization of AI in citizens' sciences and particularly citizen participation. The European Commission has recently published the “European Union's Ethics Guidelines For Trustworthy AI” (EGTAI), stressing the fact that AI tools need to meet specific principles in order to be deemed trustworthy. One of the seven principles argued by the EGTAI focuses on diversity, non-discrimination, and fairness, which calls for the involvement of relevant stakeholders through the entire life circle of AI tools. However, research and practice have very limited knowledge on how stakeholders and citizens are involved in developing AI tools and their consequences for the quality and trustworthiness of AI algorithms. To address this gap, the present paper examines several case studies to identify how public or private organizations are considering the EGTAI guidelines with a specific interest in stakeholder participation. The core driving question of the research is: What are the consequences of stakeholder and citizen involvement for the trustworthiness of AI tools?","Department of Public Administration, Erasmus University Rotterdam",Universiteit Twente,,,,,,,Universiteit Twente,,Adrià Albareda,Islam Bouzguenda,,,,,,,Islam Bouzguenda,,Governance,Interest Groups,Technology,,,,,,Promoting a trustworthy Artificial Intelligence?

0,"The Coronavirus pandemic poses a major health and economic threat to societies around the world. The success of new measures that policymakers and health officials have introduced to combat the pandemic often relies on voluntary compliance by citizens. While the pandemic has brought increased relevance to prosocial and altruistic behaviour, it is unclear if the pandemic coincides with changes in self-reported dispositional empathy, and to what extent dispositional empathy affects support for governmental measures. I use a representative three-wave panel survey of UK citizens (N=7480) to analyse (1) if the Coronavirus pandemic led to an increase in affective and cognitive empathy from pre- to mid-pandemic, (2) what factors moderate change in empathy, and (3) in what way affective and cognitive empathy drive pandemic-related attitudes, including support for governmental measures to combat the pandemic and a sense of duty to follow new rules. I find that affective and cognitive empathy remained stable from pre- to mid-pandemic on average, but that personal experience during the pandemic helps explain subgroup variation. More empathic people feel a stronger sense of duty to follow the rules and report stronger support for measures to combat the pandemic, but there are significant differences between different types of measures. For some measures, there are significant differences between affective and cognitive empathy, but not for all. These findings improve our understanding of how affective and cognitive empathy shape attitudes and behaviour during a major crisis and imply that empathy plays a crucial role in explaining prosocial behaviour during the Coronavirus pandemic.",University of Oxford,,,,,,,,University of Oxford,,Florian Simon Schaffner,,,,,,,,Florian Simon Schaffner,,Institutions,Political Participation,Political Psychology,Political Sociology,Electoral Behaviour,,,,Prosocial Behaviour and COVID-19: How Affective and Cognitive Empathy Drive Support for Measures to Combat the Coronavirus Pandemic,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65966&EventID=185
0,"Since 2015, Mozambique has experienced an increase in the number of vulnerable people, particularly in the country's central provinces and mainly in rural areas. The rise of poverty and vulnerability is the result of a combination of several factors, such as the economic crisis, renewed violence in 2014, and reduced foreign aid flows due to the 2016 hidden debt crisis scandal. The escalating conflict in Cabo Delgado and COVID-19 pandemic have worsened the situation. Following two decades of progress in fighting poverty, it is important to understand what explains the growing numbers of vulnerable individuals and the measures implemented to address this problem. Drawing on a literature review, official documents, data, and interviews, this article discusses the impact of these emergencies on poverty and vulnerability in Mozambique, since 2015. It also explores the measures enacted by the government and by other actors – internationally and on the ground – to respond to this challenge.","Centro de Estudos Sociais, University of Coimbra",Faculty of Economics of the University of Coimbra,,,,,,,Faculty of Economics of the University of Coimbra,,Teresa Almeida Cravo,Maria Clara Oliveira,,,,,,,Maria Clara Oliveira,,Africa,Conflict,Development,Social Policy,,,,,Protecting the poor in difficult times: the case of Mozambique (2015-2022),https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=66126&EventID=185

0,"Created in 1972, the United Nations’ environmental programme (UNEP) provides expertise to
the United Nations organized by seven thematic subprogrammes and works with professionals
to conduct that mandate. Yet, the literatures in International Relations (IR) and Global
Environmental Politics (GEP) do not engage with UNEP’s expertise and its professionals and
rather choose to study scientific and technical advice provided by expert groups and panels such
as the IPCC or IPBES. More specifically, we know little about the sociology of professions in
the field of global environment at the United Nations.
Borrowing from Science, Technology and Society (STS) and International Political Sociology
(IPS) literatures, new research avenues can be explored to understand the fabric of UNEP’s
expertise through the circulation of experts and knowledge. How do these experts work with
and within the United Nations to provide advice on environmental issues? This paper offers an
analysis of their career and networks through a study of UNEP’s expertise. It provides
knowledge of how experts work and engage with UNEP’s mandate through science-policy
interfaces. It examines more specifically how these experts makes sense of and participate to
the conduct of UNEP’s mandate. Using a network analysis of 254 experts and a sociology of
professions relying on semi-structured interviews of 23 of them, it proposes a typology of their
professional ethos.
The typology identifies the career’s organizational principle that drives experts’ engagement
with UNEP’s mandate. The first type is scholar experts who are custodians of a specific know-
how acquired through their training and offered during their career to organizations. Secondly,
nomadic experts are driven by the cause they defend through organizations. Finally, the third
type is sedentary experts because they organize their career within the range of international
institutions’ bureaucratic permanent positions. Each of these type of career reveals the
characteristics of a professional ethos that uncover practices of reflexive-monitoring of UNEP’s
mandate. These practices demonstrate that experts’ role go beyond simply giving advice to
policymakers because they engage more than a piece of advice when they organize their career
with the mandate of UNEP.",University of Vienna,,,,,,,,University of Vienna,,Krystel Wanneau,,,,,,,,Krystel Wanneau,,Environmental Policy,Governance,UN,Knowledge,Global,,,,"Providing more than advice: a study of UNEP’s experts scholar, nomadic and sedentary careers",https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65486&EventID=185

The EU regularly uses economic sanctions against third countries in the framework of its Common Foreign and Security Policy in order to promote democracy. Yet at the same time, today with democracy being challenged within its borders by Hungary and Poland, the EU resorts to coercive measures to react to norm violations among its members. The effort of imposing sanctions under Article 7 as well as through alternative frameworks is meant to deprive member states which violate EU democraticnorms of certain perks in the EU context, such as Council voting rights. Taking the case of Poland, we investigate citizens’ reactions to EU intentions to impose sanctions and to influence state policies against EU members, non-members and Poland itself. Using a survey experiment administered to a representative sample of Poles (N=1000), we study whichfactors influence how respondents think about EU sanctions, as well as whether the sanction’s target matters.

To contribute to this gap in our knowledge, we investigate references to public opinion by policymakers in parliamentary debates. This also gives us insights into how policymakers and parties use public opinion strategically and rhetorically to achieve their own goals. We combine qualitative coding and semi-supervised, deep learning algorithms to identify and categorize references to public opinion in the Bundestag (German parliament) using transcriptions of all parliamentary debates from 1991 to 2017. Our first finding is that public opinion appears quite often in Bundestag debates. Our second finding is that machine-based prediction does a decent job in categorizing references to public opinion. Using the semi-supervised classification algorithm (BERT) we were able to distinguish public opinion references from noise (sentences that include public opinion terms but are not actually public opinion statements) with an F1 score of 0.76 and an accuracy score of 0.78. We are currently working on improving the accuracy of our algorithm. Our next findings are still in progress, but we will develop a descriptive picture of the many uses of public opinion and how these change over time and across both parties and policy domains.

Some have praised the latter for improving the quality of policy-making while others have argued that citizens are happy to be bystanders of democracy.

We expect citizens to judge policy-making processes more positively (1) the stronger the deliberative component, (2) the more citizens participate, and (3) when the policy outcomes reflect the position of the citizens participating as well as 4) the position of the majority of the public. We conducted a survey experiment with a random sample of 3,000 Danish citizens who are presented with a description of a fictitious policy-making scenario. Our findings present a sobering view of the potential of citizen engagement to boost legitimacy. Citizens generally do not care whether and which participatory elements are used. Instead, their assessments of legitimacy are affected by whether decision-makers act in line with the positions of the public and the participating citizens.

0,"In 2014, the Irish Government established Public Participation Networks (PPNs) in each local authority area in the country to enable the public to take an active formal role in local policy making and oversight committees of their local authority. PPNs also provide a means for local authorities to connect with community groups around the country and to benefit from their expertise. Any local group can participate in one or more of three different policy areas: Social Inclusion, Community & Voluntary; and Environment. This paper analyses survey data collected from over 100 groups that participate in the Environment section of their local PPN to investigate their organisational structure, their activities, their beliefs, and the extent to which they engage with the Environmental Pillar – the organisation representing ENGOs at the national level and who provide a channel for Government and other social partners to engage with the environmental sector. Results show that most groups are entirely made up of volunteers, have few members, are majority female, and do not have children as members. Nearly all groups have a strong “pro-ecological” world view (on the New Environmental Paradigm Scale, Dunlap, 2008) and believe that citizens, local government, national government, and industry are not doing too enough to protect the environment. Besides climate change, most groups are focused on issues related to biodiversity loss, water quality, planning & development and raising environmental awareness. The vast majority of the groups have few or no network ties (collaboration, information exchange, forum participation) with the national ENGOs that make up the Environmental Pillar. These findings are indicative of the fact that Ireland is one of the most centralized states in Europe, with local or regional groups having few responsibilities or resources. The consequences of the local groups being detached from national level ENGOs and from national decision-making authorities are that the government is less likely to be aware of their preferences and that these groups are unlikely to have much influence over decision-makers.",Dublin City University,,,,,,,,Dublin City University,,Valesca Lima,,,,,,,,Valesca Lima,,Civil Society,Governance,Local Government,Political Participation,Climate Change,,,,Public Participation in Local Climate Change Governance - The Case of Environmental Groups in Ireland,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63261&EventID=185
0,"What kind of misperceptions do citizens have when it comes to political authority in the EU? And what are the characteristics of individuals that hold misperceptions? This paper sheds light on these questions and presents results of a population based survey that was conducted in France, France, Italy, Sweden, Poland, and Spain (about N=1000 per country). 

We know little about the level of knowledge that Europeans have about the EU and the extent to which they might be misinformed. Misperceptions are however fertile ground for the spread of misinformation and “Euro myths”. Such myths can play a particularly important role when they are mobilised in a populist fashion. 

About two thirds of respondents know that MEPs are directly elected. Every second respondent knows that EU legislation cannot be passed against the will of the EP. A third of respondents knows that the European Commission cannot pass legislation against the will of a majority of member states. A substantively important share of respondents also holds nontrivial misperceptions. One in five respondents believe that MEPs are not directly elected. An even larger share of respondents believes that the European Commission could overrule the will of a majority of member states. 

We build on the American public opinion and political psychology literatures to theorize why citizens hold misperceptions. What we find is that interest in politics does not differentiate those with correct and incorrect perceptions much from one another, but it sets these groups of respondents apart from individuals who have no views on the matter. We also find evidence for motivated reasoning. Citizens’ predispositions shape how they perceive the political system of the EU: individuals who do not think of themselves as European (i.e. those who only identify with their nation) are more likely to hold misperceptions.",University of Exeter,University of Exeter,,,,,,,University of Exeter,,Jason Reifler,Florian Stoeckel,,,,,,,Florian Stoeckel,,European Union,Political Psychology,Knowledge,Comparative Perspective,Euroscepticism,Survey Research,,,Public Perceptions and Misperceptions of Political Authority in the European Union,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65245&EventID=185
0,"Public policy and policy analysis education have been recognized as trainings in both academic and professional fields(Geva-May & Maslove, 2007). Although sharing many characteristics with each other, the development of public affairs programs in each country is highly influenced by different political contexts and regional cultures(Geva-May & Maslove, 2007). As increasing attention has been paid to the education in public policy, an evaluation of current public policy curriculum design is necessary to provide useful information to develop high quality education in this field. Comparative public policy has been an important focus for researchers and policy practitioners to understand policy formulation, implementation, and evaluation in different governments or academic institutions across nations. The essence of the comparative approach is context-sensitivity, that is, awareness that context matters and should be incorporated into research. Contributions of this approach are practical for meeting curricular needs, and theoretical in making research more rigorous, revealing underlying, often US-oriented assumptions and exploring alternative contexts (Minnowbrook III, 2008).
The study examines public policy programs in Asia Pacific, North American and European universities (please see appendix). The public policy curricula of mater’s levels are carefully reviewed. The preliminary findings reveal that each public policy program places policy process and policy analysis as required courses. Global policy context and local policy context both gain importance on public policy curriculum design.

Yeung (2001) recognizes three possible attitudes available for researchers not from the centre: (1) to play the game as an insider, (2) to play the game as an outsider and (3) to exit the game altogether. For the purpose of our study we suggest a modification of the Yeung’s typology and we distinguish three types of scholars outside the centre  
•	Insiders. - staying in the academic institution located outside of the centre, but becoming recognized part of the mainstream academic life by the centre and having  well developed network of academic contacts in the universities of the core area “being admitted to the club”),
•	“Imitators” – researchers who desire to adapt to the methodological patterns imposed by the centre and attempt to be present in international academic circulation. They may participate in the international networks of academics, but their position in the network is less central than of the insiders.
•	“Separatists” - a characteristic attitude is the refusal to follow the patterns and forms of activity preferred by the centre. The researcher concentrates mainly on publication in local languages and in local journals.  
We expect that younger scholars are more open for internationalization and adjust more to the relatively new incentives to publish in reputable international journals rather than in local journals or chapters in edited books.

0,"As a result of limited resources, increased corruption accusations, widespread austerity and democratic crises sub-national and national governments have been pushed to find new, often technology-fueled and more participatory approaches to governance. Over the last decade, governments across the world have launched an increasing number of all sorts of e-government initiatives which hold the promise of enhancing transparency and participation, and thus reducing corruption as well as other innovative forms of citizen participation including citizen’s juries, hackathons, living labs and participatory budgeting. Not only new technologies have been used to facilitate the reporting of corruption and give access to official information, but also to keep different entities more accountable thanks to the transparency and participation of different stakeholders, citizens and beyond, in various decision-making processes that they would otherwise be excluded from. 
However, literature argues that despite significant developments in the field, people-oriented dimension of publicness is still missing from various city imaginaries. Responding to the critique that policies implemented by cities almost exclusively refer to technological improvements and provision of technological solutions, policymakers and researchers are now shifting towards the magnitude of involvement of citizens in devising city imaginaries and decision-making. Prioritization of people in smart city development and the subsequent construction varies modalities of techno-public assemblages is believed to be the missing element in governance. 
Study is set within qualitative paradigm within framework of constructivism, which rejects that the reality must be investigated through scientific enquiry. Study uses case study methodology which makes allowances for application of various data collection methods and subsequently a comparative case study multi-stage research design composed of document analysis and interviews with key stakeholders is adopted.
While technology is a vital enabler in the undergoing transformation, it only composes one element of governance, leaving a playing field for public authorities to encourage citizens to engage in new processes and practices. Thus, the resulting paper focuses on how citizens input into the governance processes in novel ways.

0,"The Advocacy Coalition Framework (ACF) is one of the most robust and frequently applied approaches for studying the policy process. While many of its components have remained static over its 35-year history, others have changed in response to a variety of forces. In this paper, we ask how the ACF arrived in its current form and what this says about the trajectory of ACF scholarship more broadly. To do this, we leverage the ACF “flow diagram” as an analytical tool. The flow diagram depicts how the framework’s various components fit together and can serve as a boundary object for both novice and advanced ACF researchers who use the framework in diverse ways. We trace the evolution of the ACF flow diagram over time by reviewing the myriad versions that have been published by a variety of scholars across many outlets. We include those that are fairly canonical, as well as those that make significant departures and modifications for specific contextual applications. Through an analysis of the content of and adaptations to the flow diagram over time, we evaluate how the ACF has evolved in response to empirical findings, as well as other idiosyncratic factors. In doing so, we seek to “pull back the curtain” on the development of the ACF to promote advancement in both theoretical and empirical applications. This exercise helps us to reflect on the many interpretations and applications of the framework by others. It also demonstrates how the ACF flow diagram can be used as a “schematic” for applying the framework in diverse contexts. Finally, it provides insight into how the ACF can be further developed for use in analyzing critical, emerging policy problems in a rapidly transforming society.",Universität Bern,University of Oklahoma,University of Nevada Reno,Uppsala Universitet,Oklahoma State University,Hitotsubashi University,University of Colorado Denver,,University of Nevada Reno,,Karin Ingold,Hank Jenkins-Smith,Elizabeth Koebele,Daniel Nohrstedt,Kristin Olofsson,Keiichi Satoh,Chris Weible,,Elizabeth Koebele,,Governance,Interest Groups,Public Policy,Coalition,Decision Making,Influence,Policy-Making,Theoretical,Pulling Back the Curtain: Tracing the Evolution of the ACF though the Flow Diagram,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63803&EventID=185
0,"Transitional Justice is characterized by its victim-centredness. As a toolkit of accountability measures to help states transition from histories of violence to peace, transitional justice prescribes what is today considered necessary and indeed inevitable for societies to successfully break away from their violent pasts. Beyond this, transitional justice further diagnoses its participant populations, into deserving victims, and damned perpetrators, adopting a largely binary framework of participation into which complex individual conflict experiences are subsumed, and within which the (externally defined) needs of designated victims are prioritized. 

The political construction of victimhood within transitional justice is increasingly criticized among scholars, who seek to illuminate the participatory shortcomings that emerge from the binary designation of conflict-affected populations into either victims or perpetrators, and the subsequent victim-centredness of transitional justice mechanisms. This paper advances these critiques of transitional justice, by examining the silences of everyday ex-combatants within Sierra Leone’s truth and reconciliation commission (TRC). It argues that frictions between ex-combatant justice hopes against restrictive institutional expectations around their role within the TRC interacted to silence this population. It advances calls for greater recognition of complex victimhood within transitional justice, away from static and binary understandings of victims and perpetrators as mutually exclusive categories, towards an integration of the fluid and intersecting experiences that characterize the reality of war among conflict-affected individuals.",University of Sheffield,,,,,,,,University of Sheffield,,Sayra van den Berg,,,,,,,,Sayra van den Berg,,,,,,,,,,Punishing silence: complex victimhood among everyday ex-combatants in Sierra Leone’s truth commission,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=66329&EventID=185
0,"Our paper would be well suited for Section 2 of the panel, i.e., Political Actor’s behaviour in Sub-National Politics

Economic voting relays on three assumptions: First, voters use assessment of regional and national economy to reward or punish regional/national incumbent governments at the time of elections. Second, representatives at each level are aware that voters hold them accountable, and third they act accordingly to maximize re-elections. 
Using two unique panel datasets, the Norwegian Citizens Panel and the Panel of Elected Representatives in Norway, our study confirms that at the first step, perceptions of the economy are associated with vote for or against the incumbent party. Secondly, we show that voters are motivated by sanctioning politicians, therefore keeping them accountable for the governing period. Thirdly, we show that representatives who perceive that their voters are motivated by sanctioning voting, are less inclined to have incongruent positions. We test this incongruence by using preference for income redistribution at the time of elections and agreeing to increase taxes several years after the elections. In addition, political representatives have a lower inclination to deviate from their own party position if they think voters are going to sanction their political behavior.
Finally, we also show that these assumptions hold when voters asses the regional instead of the national economy, where about one third of the voters assess the regional economy as better or worst then the national economy. In the regions where the regional economy is evaluated as worst then the national, we observe higher level of sanctioning voting, which is noted by politicians who subsequently have more congruent positions to the one they held at time of elections. 
These findings are even more remarkable considering that we find strong evidence of the above assumptions in a case such as Norway, a country with high level of agreement regarding the taxation policies and where the regional economic differences are relatively small. Our study not only confirms the economic voting model exist in multilevel context, but also reveals that economic voting plays out differently across the statewide territory.",Universitetet i Bergen,Universitetet i Bergen,,,,,,,Universitetet i Bergen,,Martin Okolikj,Arjan H.

0,"Transitional justice has been touted as the most promising framework for addressing conflict and atrocities globally, exemplified by the ICC – an international court which theoretically holds the power to bring perpetrators to justice. However, ‘justice’ at the ICC and beyond is often delivered by victors to 'survivors' in the form of punitive justice, which is branded as a success in international media – with a few perpetrators going to court, justice reigning supreme, and countries moving forward. This paper argues that pursuing punitive justice as the hallmark of transitional justice is a misguided approach at best. Whereas there are many voices advocating for harsher sentences related to human rights atrocities, this approach is vulnerable to exploitation by media-savvy authoritarian leaders institutionalising justice as a political tool. For example in North Uganda, global efforts to bring transitional justice have been co-opted by a government deeply involved in the atrocities in question – a government which now wields an international mandate to ‘pursue justice’, translating to increased suppression and political power. Indeed, similar case studies (such as DRC or Sri Lanka) showcase that confronting violence needs to return power to the people and promote reconciliation, including finding mechanisms for communities to grow together and shape a common understanding of memory, truth and history. This approach can challenge the perception of ‘justice’ as a form of punishment, and instead help communities approach the psyche of the ‘injustice’ as a separate entity that affected groups must grapple with. This is a spatial critique of justice/injustice, proposing bottom-up reconciliation as a tool of dealing with the past that not only aims to deliver a fair justice that is perceived as such even by the perpetrators, but also a tool that can foster pacification and ensure peace on the long term.",School of Oriental and African Studies,,,,,,,,School of Oriental and African Studies,,Jasper Kiepe,,,,,,,,Jasper Kiepe,,Africa,Conflict,Human Rights,Memory,Transitional justice,,,,Punishment Instead of Progress – The Psyche of Injustice as a Critique of Punitive Transitional Justice,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64377&EventID=185
0,"This paper explores the behavior of secessionist MEPs in the European Parliament and thereby seeks to better understand how European integration has affected secessionist political parties. Contrary to expectations, European integration seems to have sustained, rather than eradicated, the quest for independence in the EU by pro-European secessionist parties, which is effectively challenging the status quo and political organization of the EU. Secessionist parties have also been eager to use channels with access to European policy-making, despite there being little formal room to address independence. Hence, there is a need to better understand how and to what extent European integration plays a role in shaping secessionist party strategies. Previous research has so far overwhelmingly focused on the Europeanization of secessionist parties at the national level, even though mobilization in the European Parliament has been a consistent component of their strategy as well. Yet, we know surprisingly little about how and to what extent it is used as an international forum to promote secessionist interests and visions of independence in the EU. This study hopes to break new ground by offering a systematic comparative analysis of how secessionist parties have been making use of the European Parliament and draws on new data from the last twenty years. In particular, the paper explores how pro-European secessionist MEPs have balanced their interests in the European Parliament between 1999 and 2019 and to what extent they have Europeanized their separatist agenda by taking it to the supranational level.

0,"QAnon, the conspiracy theory followed by millions of social media users in the United States, has also significantly gained ground in a couple of European countries, among them Austria and Germany. The Covid-19 pandemic has functioned as kind of a fire accelerant, quite a number of European QAnon branches have sprung up online. Fears stirred up by the coronavirus outbreak have significantly contributed to the increase of European QAnon followers and believers in the “Deep State” model. More and more people in Austria and Germany have meanwhile joined QAnon on Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and especially on Telegram. QAnon symbols and references to the conspiracy theory are particularly visible also at so-called ""Corona rallies"". While such protests assemble heterogeneous groups of activists such as anti-vaxxers, government sceptics, white supremacists, and far-right activists, the influence of the far right, which is quite agreeable to QAnon's ideas, has grown over the months. The “theories” conveyed by QAnon perfectly fit Coronavirus conspiracy constructions such as alleged secret plans pertaining to vaccination programs or supposed dangerous manipulations by powerful individuals and arcane societies. Moreover, QAnon narratives can easily be connected to the main stories about ""The Great Replacement"" and ""The Great Reset"", propagated by diverse far right groups in Germany and Austria. They also relate to anti-pluralistic, anti-liberal, and anti-Semitic patterns that mold the political cultures of Austria and Germany.
The paper presents selected results of the comparative research project “Protests against governmental measures relating to the Covid-19 pandemic in Austria and Germany”. The data were collected first by means of an online survey complemented by short problem centered qualitative interviews with Corona rallies participants. Second, netnographic methods were used to observe relevant Telegram and Facebook groups and to collect textual and visual material online. In addition, media material has been collected, using the Austrian Media Corpus, one of the largest text corpora in the German language, the APA Online Manager, and the archive of the German News Agency. The analysis of the media material followed the principles of theoretical sampling, data have been selected for in-depth analysis on the basis of their potential representation of important concepts and constructs, and shall reflect as precisely as possible what is going on in the field. 
The multimodal analysis allows for the reconstruction of both text frames and visual frames as important and effective means of meaning making. The study combines statistical analysis of the survey data, both quantitative and qualitative text analytical tools, elements of critical discourse analysis, visual context analysis and image type analysis.
This is to explain why centuries-old conspiracy theories that have returned from the United States to Europe in new garments currently achieve such striking success. One of the results highlights the adaptation of QAnon’s US based narratives into EU-centered - or even local - narratives, where they merge with pre-existing conspiracy narratives. Moreover, it will be demonstrated that QAnon functions as kind of a conspiracy theory sponge which gives a home to diverse and even contradictory narratives.",University of Vienna,,,,,,,,University of Vienna,,Karin Liebhart,,,,,,,,Karin Liebhart,,Democracy,Extremism,Media,Populism,Social Movements,Social Media,Protests,Empirical,QAnon's Rise in Europe: A Multimodal Analysis of the Examples of Austria and Germany,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65530&EventID=185
0,"Queer thought identifies structures of heteronormativity that constitute straight and cis privilege. From a queer perspective, to assure equal rights is not enough, as regimes and normativities cannot be neutral or universalistic but always support particular cultures and identities. Thus, even when formally neutral legal rights are assured, straight and cis privilege prevails when such legal change is not accompanied by cultural politics against heteronormativity.  Queer politics, therefore, aims at fostering particularistic counter cultures. Only those can lead to the flourishing of non-heteronormative life; without them, the force of heteronormativity overrules queer life, as the critique of “homonormativity” points out. To content, then, that legal neutrality is universally good for everyone is thus a false universality. The paper suggests that political theory as a whole can learn from this queer hermeneutics against false universalities. False universalities that blend out privilege are a key fallacy in the contemporary critique against “identity politics”. For example, it is a false universality to answer Black Lives Matter by arguing that all lives should matter. As the appeal to false universalities is rather obvious in conservative and liberal critiques of identity politics, I will discuss it regarding a more subtle case: Nancy Fraser’s work on recognition and redistribution. I show that by interpreting queerness and deconstruction as aiming at the dissimilation of identity, Fraser’s critique, unintentionally, leads to the universalization of a cis-straight and white perspective. Queering universalities as a general method for contemporary political theory, then, entails identifying and critiquing false universalizations and to re-start research from the particular perspectives of minorities.",Albert-Ludwigs-Universität Freiburg,,,,,,,,Albert-Ludwigs-Universität Freiburg,,Karsten Schubert,,,,,,,,Karsten Schubert,,Political Theory,Representation,Critical Theory,Identity,Methods,Normative Theory,LGBTQI,Political Cultures,Queering False Universalities.

0,"Since the Brexit referendum and election of Donald Trump in 2016, scholars and commentators have spoken of the emergence of a ‘post-truth era’ characterised by a decline in trust in expertise and circulation of disinformation. The election of populist authoritarian ‘strongmen’ in a range of contexts has coincided with continued attacks on immigrants, ‘experts’, and mainstream politicians. The Covid-19 pandemic has exacerbated conflicts over scientific expertise and trust in ‘knowledge authorities’, and further encouraged the online proliferation of disinformation. The present moment is also one in which women, girls, people of colour and queer individuals are receiving an unprecedented amount of abuse facilitated by social media, with a significant amount of this abuse occurring online and being of a violent, sexualised and racist nature. Indeed, scientists who were launched into the public eye during the Covid-19 pandemic have reported sustained attacks and campaigns of harassment on social media. Online abuse is often understood as an act that is deeply rooted in the private sphere; it is often sent anonymously, is received on the laptop or phone of the recipient rather than in a public venue, and is obscured by the processes of silencing that it induces. Furthermore, it often constrains these individuals’ ability to engage in public discussion and debate, for fear of further abuse or threats of violence. Locating discrete acts of online violence within a global context in which the concepts of truth, trust and authority are being denigrated, we argue that existing frameworks struggle to capture the ways in ‘post-truth politics’ has particular effects on the most marginalised groups. 

Using Brexit as a case study and applying an intersectional feminist and queer theoretical lens, we explore the way in which different forms of expertise are given credibility or actively denigrated by ‘mainstream’ media and social media commentators. Analysing comments on UK right-wing newspaper social media pages under articles about academic/legal/scientific experts’ contributions to Brexit debates, this paper traces how (often violent) sexual, gendered and racialised discourses are deployed, and the extent to which this reflects colonial understandings of subjectivity that were exclusive to the white, European male. Drawing upon these themes, it unpacks how the figure of ‘the expert’ has been constructed and contested within these online spaces, with the ultimate goal of understanding how LGBTQ+ people, women and people of colour relate to and contest violent and exclusionary stereotypes of expertise. In so doing, we demonstrate the need for further theoretical and empirical work that unpacks the gendered, racialised and sexualised dynamics of ‘post-truth’ in a post-pandemic Europe.",University of Birmingham,,,,,,,,University of Birmingham,,Charlotte Galpin,,,,,,,,Charlotte Galpin,,European Union,Gender,Media,Populism,Feminism,Social Media,Brexit,LGBTQI,"Queering Post-Truth Politics: Silencing, Violence and Resistance in Online Debates about EU Integration",https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65948&EventID=185
0,"Building on my research on the history of radical sexual politics in France between 1945 and 1970, this paper aims to demonstrate that the history of sexuality requires a queer approach. Nowadays, the term queer has two meanings depending on whether it characterizes an identity or an approach. While these two meanings are related, they are very much in tension. As Jeffrey Weeks explains, ‘some self-defined queer historians see their practice as a break with lesbian and gay history; others see strong lines of continuity’ (2012).  Indeed, doing queer history can mean going against approaches that take sexual and gender identities and labels as obvious categories, ready to be applied to any study of the history of sexual politics.  The question of the use of categories of gender and sexuality identities has been at the heart of methodological and theoretical debates around the emergence of gender politics history in the late 1980s and of queer history in the 2010s (Scott, 1986; Scott, 1992; Downs, 1993; Weeks, 2012; Krylova, 2016). 
My call to queer the sexual revolution maps on the two meanings of the word queer. First, it means bringing out queer voices and recovering the importance of those intellectuals and activists who did not conform to the heterosexual norm. This is important because the sexual politics formulated before the 1970s in France tend to be described as ‘male and heterosexual’ (Coffin, 2020). Uncovering queer voices, therefore, reshapes the usual narrative about the pre-feminist and pre-LGBT sexual revolution. I am not just aiming at recovering marginalized voices, but also at writing the political history of the sexual revolution in a way that does not attach strict categories of gender and sexual identities to the actors I am studying. Indeed, pre-1970s French sexual politics did not rely on notions of identity, and historians of sexual politics, therefore, need to think beyond the paradigm of identity to understand their peculiarity. I argue that the absence of the rhetoric of identity in pre-1970s sexual politics is what led scholars to consider that these early sexual politics were dominated by heterosexual men. However, if we look closely at the intimate experiences of the activists and intellectuals who defended the sexual revolution between 1945 and 1970, we see that many of them had experiences that deviated from the gender expectations and sexual norms of the time. Moreover, if we look at their claims and their writings, they denote a complex relationship with feminism and gay activism, which shows they considered the issues faced by gay and lesbian people and women. French discussions on the sexual revolution before the 1970s offer a case study to critically reflect on how historians of sexual politics use categories of identity. It is this process of questioning the use of categories of identity that prevail in contemporary political analyses of sexual minorities that I call queering the sexual revolution.",University of Glasgow,,,,,,,,University of Glasgow,,Blanche Plaquevent,,,,,,,,Blanche Plaquevent,,Civil Society,Gender,Feminism,Identity,Methods,Narratives,Activism,LGBTQI,Queering the French Sexual Revolution: Reflecting on the Use of Categories of Identity in the History of Sexual Politics,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65152&EventID=185
0,"Secessionist movements involve sustained collective action by networks of actors claiming rights of withdrawal from formal state authority. Often, and especially in democratic contexts, these networks include both institutional and non-institutional actors. However, the relationship between the two has been regrettably overlooked despite literature has argued that political parties and social movement organizations are mutually dependent actors in shaping politics. Scotland constitutes an interesting case in this regard because while Scottish political elites called for an independence referendum in 2012, grassroots organizations appropriated the Yes campaign in the run-up to the referendum. This referendum campaign was characterized by a particularly high degree of eventfulness which is about the capability of producing new relations and resources that catalyze mobilization. Studies on eventful campaigns have observed that the latter impact on the very movements that carry them out. In the course of the referendum campaign, interactions among a plurality of actors were intensified and transformed. Secessionist networks expanded at great speed and debates were fueled by the interplay between different visions of independence. A qualitative study is conducted to explore the links between pro-independence parties and grassroots organizations both on the organizational and discursive level. By doing so, not only does this paper address the need to include non-institutional actors in the study of territorial contention but it also looks at them in interaction with institutional actors thus challenging the non-institutionalized vs. institutionalized divide.",Scuola Normale Superiore,,,,,,,,Scuola Normale Superiore,,Carla Mannino,,,,,,,,Carla Mannino,,Contentious Politics,Nationalism,Political Parties,Social Movements,Campaign,Mobilisation,,,Questioning boundaries: party-movement relations in the Scottish referendum campaign,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65674&EventID=185

One of the main conclusions of this study is that in most countries there have been minor to any changes over the last 30 years. This is potentially reasoned by the ideas that these countries have reached an optimal level regarding at least several dimensions of local autonomy. Another conclusion was that local autonomy significantly increased in Armenia between 2014 and 2018. However, it did remain behind the European average.

0,"The recent reform of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) has introduced a new delivery model (NDM), granting Member States more flexibility in implementing the CAP. It requires Member States to develop Strategic Plans (SPs) in which they specify their contribution to the CAP’s general objectives by translating these into national targets. The SPs (and their implementation and results) are assessed ex ante and ex post by the European Commission. The NDM can be seen as a way to deal with diversity among Member States, but also as a way to increase the performance of the CAP. In the recent literature and policy debates this new model is discussed in terms of a (re)nationalization of the CAP or in relation to Member States’ capacity for strategic planning.

0,"How do racial hierarchies affect the workforce of international organizations? Building on the concept of racialized organizations in American politics, we develop a theory of racialized international organizations. We argue that international organizations, like domestic organizations, are characterized by diminished agency of racialized groups, a racialized distribution of resources, Whiteness as a credential, and racial decoupling. Such processes in international organizations are affected by the racialized distribution of power and wealth in the international system, on the one hand, and racial hierarchies that exist in societies from which international organizations draw their workforce, on the other hand. Using the crucial case of UN peacekeeping, we demonstrate that the UN exhibits the four features of racialized organizations. First, staff hired locally in countries hosting multidimensional peacekeeping operations, which are situated in Africa, Asia, or the Caribbean, have fewer opportunities to exercise agency compared with international staff, who often hail from White-majority countries. Second, peacekeepers of color perform more difficult and dangerous jobs under worse conditions than their White counterparts, who thus hoard a common organizational resource – physical security. Third, Whiteness serves as a proxy for desirable skills in UN peacekeeping, while the knowledge and experience of peacekeepers of color are instrumentalized. Fourth, peacekeepers from White-majority countries demand and receive special treatment, thus deviating from UN-wide procedures, which constitutes racialized decoupling. We conclude by outlining a research agenda for applying the theory of racialized international organizations beyond UN peacekeeping, including in headquarters-focused intergovernmental organizations and international non-governmental organizations.",Kings College London,University of Reading,,,,,,,Kings College London,,Kseniya Oksamytna,Sarah von Billerbeck,,,,,,,Kseniya Oksamytna,,Governance,Representation,UN,Global,Race,Peace,,,Race and International Organizations,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63341&EventID=185

0,"Traditional Advocacy Coalition Framework (ACF) scholarship recognizes the stability of coalitions over longer periods of time, yet sometimes external events force rapid development of coalitions, especially when policy change is imminent and required. This is not a case of external shock within an existing subsystem, but rather the creation of a new – usually highly conflictual – issue area in which coalitions and their associated beliefs did not previously exist. An example is the policy response to COVID-19 in the United States. As scholars and practitioners, we need to know more about these situations because when they happen, they are significant. However, little research exists that tracks the emergence of a new subsystem, particularly when circumstances demand policy change and there is immediate conflict between evolving coalitions. 

This paper studies a four-year period before and after the 2020 landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision in McGirt v. Oklahoma. In McGirt v. Oklahoma, the US Supreme Court determined that the reservation of the Muscogee Nation was never properly dissolved by the US Congress and thereby implicitly returned criminal and other jurisdiction back to the tribal nation. Much of eastern Oklahoma would be impacted, including the city of Tulsa. Suddenly, substantial questions of jurisdiction had to be answered, and not just criminal. While allocation of property rights and mineral rights was never under question in the case, regulation of mineral extraction is now highly uncertain. This research uses a variety of text documents, such as amicus and policy briefs and news media, to map an emergent subsystem in Oklahoma. Our aim is to learn more about: When coalitions have to be gathered rapidly, how do policy actors convey their beliefs and establish relationships? We form our expectations based on past work in psychology and political behavior implying that actors turn to cognitive shortcuts and heuristics to form their belief systems in the absence of existing value signals. This paper advances ACF theory on subsystem emergence and belief systems and contributes methodologically to the field through the novel application of coding scheme that has been used in several other cases in recent years. For practitioners, this paper uncovers much of the beliefs driving policymaking in this particular case and lends insight into how policy actors react to novel, significant events.",Oklahoma State University,,,,,,,,Oklahoma State University,,Kristin Olofsson,,,,,,,,Kristin Olofsson,,Governance,Public Policy,Coalition,Policy Change,State Power,,,,Rapid Subsystem Emergence: When Policy Change Shapes Coalitions,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63315&EventID=185

0,"The notion of the ‘enabling state’ has often referred to unemployment regimes emphasising the importance of generating ‘welfare to work’ incentives. At the same time, the ‘enabling state’ is said to suffer from a legitimacy issue in that citizens are said to be increasingly ‘disconnected’ from the state. While the literature has largely focused on the policy content of these welfare reforms, less attention has been paid to the ways in which welfare states have sought to ‘connect’ to potential welfare recipients. This paper focuses therefore in particular on the ‘administrative’ side of the enabling state, pointing to a central source of ‘citizen disconnect’ as diagnosed in the wider public administration literature.

Drawing on cross-national research, this paper explores how understandings of administrative burdens have shaped the design and operation of unemployment regimes in the UK, Netherlands, Norway and Spain. A particular focus will be paid to the UK with its ambitious welfare reform, namely the move towards ‘Universal Credit’. Drawing on novel data, the paper explores the extent to which changes in the design and practices of welfare state reform across countries have been informed by concerns regarding administrative burdens and how feedback mechanisms have been used to inform ongoing administrative calibration.",The London School of Economics & Political Science,University College London,,,,,,,The London School of Economics & Political Science,,Martin Lodge,Alice Moore,,,,,,,Martin Lodge,,Public Administration,Social Welfare,Comparative Perspective,,,,,,Re-connecting access to benefits?

0,"What are the implications of shifts in EU regulatory governance for regulatory decision-making? Studies of EU regulatory governance have examined shifts from European regulatory networks to European agencies, including the conditions under which a network is (not) replaced by an agency, or why EU legislators delegate to a network or an agency. However, the implications of such shifts has received less attention. While the formal setup of networks has been compared to that of agencies, we know less about the implications of replacing a European network of national regulators with an EU agency in terms of regulatory decision-making and policy output.
In 2009, a European regulatory network was replaced by a EU energy agency. Energy was a latecomer to EU integration dynamics, and several observers have highlighted the lack of agreement across member states in how to harmonize existing regulatory and technical practices for managing electricity systems. During the years 2015-2017, the European Commission adopted regulations requiring detailed European methodologies for electricity markets and system operation to be jointly adopted by all the national energy regulators in the EU. Should the national regulators fail to agree within a pre-defined time limit, decision-making would move to the EU’s energy agency ACER.
This paper examines the outcome of decision-making made in a network setting by all regulatory authorities across Europe (network setting) with ACER-adopted decisions (agency setting). First, when does decision-making in a network setting fail, triggering escalation to ACER? Second, do decisions adopted in a network setting to a greater extent accommodate heterogeneity across member states by permitting differentiated practices, while decisions adopted by a EU agency entail more uniform, centralised rules? By examining the process and output of regulatory decision-making in network and agency settings, the paper adds to the literature on the implications of regulatory reforms in the EU.",Fridtjof Nansen Institute,,,,,,,,Fridtjof Nansen Institute,,Torbjørg Jevnaker,,,,,,,,Torbjørg Jevnaker,,European Union,Integration,Public Administration,Regulation,Energy Policy,,,,Re-organising the regulatory state: from network to agency governance in EU energy regulation,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64755&EventID=185
0,"There is an increasing political demand to engage a variety of stakeholders in decision-making processes around urban development. In the Netherlands, for example, a new Environmental Law (Omgevingswet) requires local governments to include a participatory element in all environmental development processes. The literature and practice, however, reveal that these processes often end up as conflicts by default. 

Scholars of planning have convincingly characterized the politics behind urban development processes as post-political (Swyngedouw, 2005). The theory of post-politics can provide an important explanation why citizen participation processes end up as conflicts by default. It does, however, not explain how this works in practice. Post-political theory has been criticized as a one-size-fits-all label and conceptual short-hand to group current hegemonic political forms (Puymbroeck & Oosterlynck, 2019: 103). In this paper I seek to better understand the post-political practices that shape citizen participation processes. Via an ethnographic account, I seek to unpack the post-political practices of local decision-makers and politicians during a citizen participation process in Amsterdam, pinpointing exactly which practices of citizen participation processes can be understood as post-political, how they impact the process and what it would mean to re-politicize citizen participation.",University of Amsterdam,,,,,,,,University of Amsterdam,,Nanke Verloo,,,,,,,,Nanke Verloo,,Citizenship,Conflict,Contentious Politics,Democratisation,Political Participation,,,,Re-politicizing Citizen Participation.,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65015&EventID=185
0,"Most contemporary anti-immigration actors in western Europe are not merely “nationalist”, but also positively identify as Europeans. To what extent and how do they reach out to close the borders of Europe? Research on the transnationalization of anti-immigration actors has mainly focused on social media data, often lacking information on the substance behind online ties. This article draws on structured interviews conducted with leading anti-immigrant actors within political parties, social movement organizations, and think-tanks in Germany and Norway. Based on this qualitative methodological approach, we assess the substance of anti-immigration actors’ transnationalism. More precisely, we study what forms of strong and weak transnational ties matter, distinguishing between inspiration, interaction, and cooperation. Moreover, we outline and explain differences between anti-immigration actors in both countries and among party politicians, social movement activists, and knowledge producers of and beyond the classical far-right. The results indicate that anti-immigration activists overwhelmingly draw on transnational ties, albert weak ones, in their political activism. Crucially, though, several individual brokers are the exception to the rule, relying on strong ties. The findings have important implications on how to understand anti-immigration transnationalism, contributing to ongoing debates in party politics research and social movement studies.",Universitetet i Oslo,Universitetet i Oslo,,,,,,,Universitetet i Oslo,,Manès Weisskircher,Katrine Fangen,,,,,,,Manès Weisskircher,,Democracy,Extremism,Political Parties,Social Movements,Mobilisation,,,,Reaching out to close the border?

0,"Deliberative mini-publics face threats to their integrity such as risks of co-option, manipulation and tokenism which have long been familiar to citizen participation experts (Cooke & Kothari 2001; Taylor, 2007; Christensen and Grant 2020). This paper explores further questions of deliberative integrity with relation to inclusion and power dynamics throughout the deliberative process: How might a mini-public process ensure that very marginalised groups and individuals have access to these spaces, and their voices listened to; are there grounds for purposive rather than random selection? During deliberation, how is the process and proximity to decisionmakers managed to avoid silencing the perspectives of very marginalised groups?
Participatory research processes can open up opportunities for intersectionally marginalised groups to share experiences, reflect, and construct knowledge, using a range of methods that enable different ways of knowing to be expressed. This knowledge is brought into dialogue, but usually in separate spaces that are ‘safe’, before entering some kind of public forum to engage with duty bearers (Howard, Ospina and Yorks, 2021). We see the process that leads up to engagement with duty bearers as crucial; it is where communicative confidence is grown, and divergent views amongst marginalised individuals can be expressed and acknowledged in order to move towards a sense of collective, and capacity for collective action (Shaw, Howard & Lopez-Franco, 2020). This paper will draw on research conducted in Uganda, India, and South Africa which sought to support marginalised groups to analyse their experiences of marginalisation and to engage with dutybearers to build more accountable relationships. Using Bradbury and Reason’s (2001) quality choice points, the paper will reflect on how concepts and practices of validity and ethics in participatory research can inform democratic practice (Brydon-Miller, 2008) and ‘integrity’ in deliberative mini-publics.

0,"Through city diplomacy, local activism has a global impact. The considerable rise of cities’ initiatives in recent decades has resulted in the growing number of informal arrangements that emphasize the multilateral hybrid structure of the international climate regime. The
less hierarchical code of conduct, evolving from the bottom-up participation in climate change governance, legitimizes some of the autonomous activities relating specifically to reducing greenhouse gases, climate change mitigation, and decarbonization.
The inadequacy of the central governments’ action to fulfil the international commitments influences the cities’ involvement in the international climate change agenda and nurture the emerging phenomenon of hybrid multilateralism. At the same time, hybrid multilateralism unlocks cities the possibilities of international exposure. The informal channels are critical for the cities to share common interests, act unilaterally against climate change, and follow the responsibilities steam from the international climate arrangements.
The question remains, does the frustration from the central government´s inaction encourage the cities to take action and join the international climate pledges. Do they seek support from the established trans-municipal networks? Unlike many other studies, this paper uses a quantitative methodology and a cross-sectional analysis to reveal which cities under which circumstances are more willing to join the transnational climate activism. The objective of this paper aims to uncover the rationale of the autonomous actions of cities related to the climate change battle in different parts of the world.",Prague University of Economics and Business,,,,,,,,Prague University of Economics and Business,,Nikola Adamovská,,,,,,,,Nikola Adamovská,,Environmental Policy,Governance,Local Government,Social Movements,Climate Change,Political Activism,,,Rebellious cities: on the march against climate change,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64912&EventID=185
0,"Of the vast wealth moved across the globe from corruption, estimated in the billions per year, only a small fraction has been identified, recovered, and returned to the country of origin. Over the past decade, the number of significant asset return cases has proliferated – from the Malaysian 1MDB case to the Karimova case in Uzbekistan and many more. The 2003 United Nations Convention against Corruption established that ill-gotten gains from corruption cases should be returned to their country of origin. However, there remains no coherent agreed framework for how assets should be repatriated. Principles for the disposition of stolen assets in corruption cases, developed for the 2017 Global Forum on Asset Recovery, proposed significant changes to the existing practice of asset return: chiefly, that the process should be democratized. As return models experiment with various innovations to the return process, such as centering the people of a nation as the party owed redress or integrating civil society monitoring in how funds are distributed, there remains a need for common agreed standards.  At the heart of this effort are fundamental questions around whose interests the asset return process serves, and how states respond to both populations and non-state actors in establishing the criteria for what constitutes a responsible return model. 
This paper examines normative alignment between state and non-state actors on democratizing asset return. Using text analysis of three case examples of Nigeria, Ukraine, and Equatorial Guinea, the paper analyzes where principles for responsible asset restitution have entered the mainstream. Furthermore, the paper offers insight into how the transformations that characterize globalization have led to contestation of the legitimacy of the state as an exclusive executor of accountability in cross-border corruption cases more generally, and how distributed agency to non-state actors contributes to democratized policy.",Hertie School,,,,,,,,Hertie School,,Katherine Wilkins,,,,,,,,Katherine Wilkins,,Civil Society,Democratisation,Globalisation,Corruption,NGOs,Normative Theory,Policy Change,,Recasting ‘accountability’: normative alignment between state and non-state actors for democratizing asset return,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64778&EventID=185
0,"Indigenous peoples worldwide have articulated their own claims of sovereignty, either by struggling for ‘a measure of real tribal power over their own lives and land[s]’ (De la Cadena; Starn 2002, p. 15; Lambert 2002), or by seeking ‘to reveal its multiple manifestations and refusal in a variety of contexts and texts’ (Moreton-Robinson 2007, p. 2). In a similar vein, Urt (2016) has explored the resistance of Indigenous peoples against sovereignty occlusion, ‘the practice of limiting an existing and legitimate sovereignty to the point where it presents the appearance of a non-sovereignty’ (Urt 2016, p. 866).
This paper focuses on resistance in the face of occlusion in the strategies of three contemporary Indigenous leaders in/from Brazil.  Davi Kopenawa, Ailton Krenak and Valdelice Veron, with very unique personal and collective histories, are leaders who have in different moments and institutional platforms performed the authorities inherited from their peoples. Founded in their cosmologies, their actions and thoughts express their peoples’ sovereignties. Their performances reclaim the idea of sovereignty from a self-referential Eurocentric standpoint, and subvert its modern/colonial political matrix towards politics based on ‘cosmopolitical proposals’ (Stengers 2007). Here understood as practices of Indigenous diplomacies, and taken in their own ontological significance, such performances encompass dealings with the modern diplomatic system (an international dimension), relations among different Indigenous societies (a pan-Indigenous dimension) and interactions with non-human and spiritual lifeworlds (a cosmic dimension).
This research is conducted from a methodology of Latin American feminist lineage, based on situated thinking and the centrality of the body (Gago 2020). Our perspective is inspired by the ‘three inseparable imperatives’ that guide the ethnographic work of Albert (2013, p. 430-431): ‘the first, […] to be scrupulous in doing justice to my [Indigenous] hosts’ conceptual imagination; the second, to think rigorously through the sociopolitical, local, and global context in which their society was embedded; and the third, to maintain a critical overview of the framework of the very act of ethnographic observation itself.’ Therefore, with an assumedly partial and procedural analysis, we engage with the trajectory of the aforementioned Indigenous leaders in three dimensions: the colonial situation of their peoples (Balandier 1951); their biographical accounts (Arfuch 2010); and the key contributions in their thought. The sources employed are their published texts, oral and written, as well as ethnographies about their peoples. 
Kopenawa, Krenak and Veron were chosen for their prominence in the Indigenous movement(s) in Brazil, as well as for each in their own way reclaim the concept of sovereignty. In an attempt to summarize: Kopenawa lies on his personal shamanic journey to affirm Yanomami cosmology as the foundation of his people authority over their territory (Albert; Kopenawa 2013); Krenak catalyzes the pan-Indigenous movement in Brazil, providing an intellectual grammar and willing to mediate worlds with Brazilian-settler societies (Krenak 1999; 2019; 2020); Veron struggles for the recognition of Kaiowá traditional lands, both embodying the strategy of reoccupation camps, and going on an intercultural quest towards ‘making paper speak’ about Kaiowá rights and ways (Veron; Maso; Urt; Terena 2021).","Universidad del Pais Vasco, UPV",Universidade Federal da Grande Dourados,,,,,,,Universidade Federal da Grande Dourados,,Tchella Fernandes Maso,João Nackle Urt,,,,,,,João Nackle Urt,,Political Theory,Qualitative,Power,,,,,,Reclaiming Sovereignty: Political Authority in the Strategies of Three Indigenous Leaders in Brazil,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63293&EventID=185

0,"""European civil societies have undergone extensive changes leading to a concentration of power and resources into the hands of a few large civil society organizations and their leaders. These large civil society organizations are key players in national and international arenas of policy-making. They are recognized brands with millions of members, generous donors, extensive turnover, and extraordinary access to corridors of power. Their central position allows civil society leaders to engage in shaping decisions that affect not only their members and beneficiaries, but also society more generally. While we have extensive knowledge of how recruitment of leaders occurs across political, administrative and corporate sectors, we have limited knowledge on the significance of recruitment actors, practices and criteria in leadership selection for prestigious positions in civil societies.

This paper fills this gap by comparing how civil society leaders are searched for, evaluated and selected for top positions in three different civil society regimes: Poland, Sweden and UK. The paper utilizes Jenkins (1986) distinction between suitability (formal merits and professional experiences) and acceptability criteria (personal qualities and cultural fit) to identify whether there is an overlap in the promotion of a preferred type of ‘civil society leader’ across regime divides. We draw on interviews with recruiters, HR professionals and civil society leaders in each context. Our findings point at national styles of recruitment patterns ranging from high informality in Poland and high formality in the UK, with Sweden in the middle. The paper contributes to research on political careers by looking at an under-studied category of political elites and how they are recruited for elite positions.""",Lunds Universitet,Lunds Universitet,,,,,,,Lunds Universitet,,Håkan Johansson,Milka Ivanovska Hadjievska,,,,,,,Milka Ivanovska Hadjievska,,Elites,Parliaments,Political Parties,,,,,,"Recruiting civil society elites: Comparing recruitment actors, practices and criteria in Sweden, UK and Poland",https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64829&EventID=185
0,"To contribute to combating climate change the city of Amsterdam wants to build extra wind farms. Groups of residents organised themselves in energy communities which aim to finance and operate the wind farms. However, there are also residents with major objections. These citizens are represented by the social movement organisation “Windalarm” which successfully delayed/blocked the wind energy plans of the municipality. Because many conflicts arose between politicians, members of the social movement organisation and members of the energy communities, a ‘reflection phase’ was announced in which no irreversible decisions were taken. 
In this phase a Participatory Value Evaluation (PVE) was conducted to elicit the values that underlie the considerations and worries of different groups of citizens – not only the citizens who were already engaged in the conflict, but also the silent majority. In the PVE, 5435 citizens gave an advice to the municipality. The essence of a PVE is that citizens are effectively put in the shoes of a policymaker. In this PVE, participants were shown eight possible additional requirements that the municipality could impose on plans for wind turbines. For each requirement, participants were given information about the consequences of recommending an additional requirement. After participants indicated their preferences, they were given the opportunity to explain this with arguments. These written statements were analysed by 10 researchers to elicit people’s values. 
The quantitative analysis of participants’ choices in the PVE show that citizens can be divided in two extreme clusters of supporters and opponents and three moderate clusters. The three moderate clusters all think that Amsterdam should do as much as possible to generate sustainable energy within its boundaries, but two of the moderate clusters have serious doubts about whether building additional wind farms is the right means to reach this end. Members from the moderate clusters think that the health effects of windmills should be rigorously scrutinized, and that alternatives for wind energy must be carefully explored. 
The PVE shows that health, responsibility, sustainability, intergenerational justice, intragenerational and nature/landscape are important values for a large majority of Amsterdam's citizens when it comes to making choices concerning Amsterdam's sustainable energy ambitions. However, citizens with opposing views operationalize these values differently which is a key challenge for the dialogue on wind energy. For instance, supporters of wind energy think that Amsterdam should take responsibility for combating climate change. On the other hand, opponents believe that the municipality should take its responsibility to prevent negative health effects of citizens.   
The PVE had a deescalating impact on the policy process because all stakeholders (even the citizen activists) identified themselves more with the moderate clusters than with the extreme clusters. Hence, after discussing the PVE results stakeholders found the perspectives of parties on the other side of the table more reasonable than before. Moreover, the PVE provided a starting point for dialogue as stakeholders learned that they shared values such as health, responsibility and intergenerational/intragenerational justice. The dialogue that was started after the PVE focused on solutions that respected these values.",Delft University of Technology,,,,,,,,Delft University of Technology,,Niek Mouter,,,,,,,,Niek Mouter,,Civil Society,Conflict,Democracy,Policy Analysis,Public Policy,Energy Policy,Policy-Making,,Recruiting the ‘silent majority’ to deescalate the energy conflict regarding wind farms in Amsterdam,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64879&EventID=185
0,"Qualitative research and in particular fieldwork has been heavily affected by the Covid-19 pandemic often motivating researchers to move online for data generation. This development has provided an important impetus for the ongoing advancement of digital research methods and has thus opened a space for innovation in research methods. 
In this contribution, I argue that, contrary to the common argument of physical fieldwork providing more in-depth insights than digital fieldwork, the chosen research approach depends heavily on the conditions of the studied field. In fact, by choosing digital qualitative research methods scholars can redefine their field. 
The field is redefined by and in turn impacts both the context in which research takes place and the methods available. If the field is online - for example when interviewees work from home or observation moments take place as online events - the researcher has to adapt and move online as well. Relying entirely on digital methods limits the possibilities of interviewing and observation but at the same opens new possibilities such as the coverage of multiple and distant research sites or fieldwork over a longer time period.
Borrowing from qualitative and interpretive methods with a particular focus on ethnography, I develop the methodological foundations of “digital multi-site fieldwork”. This research approach builds on insights from a research project on the role of counter-terrorism policy in EU enlargement towards South East Europe. This research project has entirely relied on digital methods and combines document analyses, multi-site digital ethnography and online interviews with counter-terrorism experts and practitioners based in different places in the EU and South East Europe.

0,"Research on citizens’ support of minipublic is mounting over the past few years, with studies indicating moderate support across different country contexts. But why do citizens support minipublics? The common narrative is that minipublics are appealing for they offer a citizen-oriented alternative to more conventional forms of political decision-making. In that regard, minipublics are more likely to reflect the preferences, information, and perspectives of the general public (e.g., Landemore, 2020). Thus, citizens tend to identify with participants in a minipublic rather than with elected representatives. Reasons include not only a general suspicion of political actors and alienation from conventional decision-making, but also trust in fellow citizens and trust in minipubics in general. The second narrative, however, presents a reverse story: citizens would have no reason to trust minipublics precisely because they cannot know who the participants are (e.g., Lafont, 2020). In that regard, lottocratic approaches tend to be individualistic and fail to reflect societal lines of conflict. Depending on the context, however, minipublics could still serve some additional functions. Yet, we know little about how perceptions of political and social trust affect support among non-participants. Drawing on conjoint experiments in Finland, Ireland, and the USA we examine support for various types of minipublics in different contexts and argue that support depends both on general political trust versus general social trust and on experience with minipublics.",Universität Stuttgart,Åbo Akademi,Universität Stuttgart,,,,,,Universität Stuttgart,,Saskia Goldberg,Marina Lindell,André Bächtiger,,,,,,Saskia Goldberg,,Comparative Politics,Democracy,Political Participation,Public Opinion,,,,,Reflecting the citizens versus reflecting individuals: When do non-participants support minipublics?,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64728&EventID=185
0,"The problem of plastics is one of the most complex global environmental challenges of our time. Despite increase of their ubiquitous use, they pose risks to human health and immense damage to natural eco-systems. Circular economy legislative approaches in the EU have been adopted to tackle the plastics problem, yet the circular economy is also immensely complex to achieve given the diverse motivations of regulated actors and uncertainty of what circularity for plastics actually is. The theory of reflexive environmental law looks at the legal mechanisms and characteristics required to govern complex challenges. Its focus on law that fosters beyond compliance, adjustable backstops, a reduction to juridification and legal system reflexivity shows great potential to help understand and improve the governance of plastics circularity. In this study, the relationship between reflexive environmental law and concepts of a circular economy for plastics are examined. Following this, a contextual analysis of legislative acts in the EU is presented to understand the diversity of reflexive environmental law approaches being taken to govern the circular economy for plastics. Included in the review are the packaging directive (2004/12/EC amending 94/62/EC), the single use plastics directive (2019/904) and transposed legislation from two member state countries considered to be big players in the global plastics market: Germany and France. Results show that all reviewed legislative acts demonstrate reflexive environmental law characteristics but also that there is diversity in the reflexive approaches being taken to govern plastics circularity. For instance, France’s new CE law places more emphasis on fostering beyond compliance and building adjustable backstops while German legislation for circular plastics focuses more on reducing juridification and building legal system reflexivity. This study is an important step in the theoretical development of regulatory approaches for governing, not just plastics circularity, but complex challenges in general. A next step to further evolve this doctrinal analysis would be to test these findings in practice and understand the extent that reflexive environmental laws identified in these legislative acts manifest and the wider driving factors for this.",Wageningen University and Research Center,Wageningen University and Research Center,Wageningen University and Research Center,Wageningen University and Research Center,,,,,Wageningen University and Research Center,,Violet Ross,Josephine van Zeben,Lucila de Almeida,Judith van Leeuwen,,,,,Violet Ross,,Environmental Policy,Public Policy,Regulation,,,,,,Reflexive environmental law for the circular plastics economy,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65620&EventID=185
0,"Wolf and van Dooren contend that “[d]emocracy is organized conflict” (2021, p. 1). The system of democracy sets the conditions for conflicts between rivalling parties to play out in a relatively organized fashion. The notion that conflict is the default in policy strongly echoes the literature on the politics and political economy of development in low-income countries (LICs), which describes development as predominantly a political struggle between rivalling groups over dominance over the political decision-making process and access to resources (e.g. Ferguson, 2020; Hutchison et al., 2014). Whilst authors on conflict in high-income countries (HICs) tend to focus on political strategies to de-escalate and overcome conflict, they operate in the context of strong nation states under the assumption of functional and impartial institutions. In contrast, conflict in democratic LICs takes place within a governance context characterized by a high degree of informality in political decision-making, a concentration of political influence by elite groups, severely limited government resources available for redistribution, and a weak social contract between state and citizens. 

This paper will investigate how the nature of policy conflict as well as policy repertoires differs in democratic LICs. It will do this by, first, introducing key concepts from the literature on the political dynamics in LICs, such as neopatrimonialism (Mkandawire, 2015). This will allow for a conceptual broadening of ‘conflict’ to highlight the importance of understanding the power and interests of networks of political agents and channels through which political influence is exercised. This in turn yields insights into why certain policies are prioritized, in which spaces policy conflict is resolved, and which actors maintain pivotal positions in the policy process. 

Second, it will review two case studies of reform coalitions in democratic LICs, supported by international aid organizations that have engaged in conflict with the state over policy reforms. The mobilization of reform coalitions has increasingly been of interest to the aid sector as a modality, because it is better able to address political challenges to development (Hudson et al., 2018). These coalitions usually consist of a combination of reform-minded politicians, civil society groups and business interests, who strategically pool their resources and influence to convince political leaders to support specific developmental reforms. Several case studies of reform coalitions have been documented in detail, providing a unique analytical window into the ways in which conflict is resolved in LIC contexts. These will show, amongst other things, the high degree of informality underlying policy processes and a broad set of repertoires used to engage with the state. The findings from the case studies will also have important conceptual implications for HICs, who may to different degrees be subject to similar dynamics.",Erasmus University,,,,,,,,Erasmus University,,Guido Maschhaupt,,,,,,,,Guido Maschhaupt,,Conflict,Democracy,Elites,Institutions,Political Economy,Developing World Politics,Coalition,Policy Change,Reform coalitions in neopatrimonial states: case studies into policy conflict in democratic low-income countries,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65805&EventID=185
0,"Mainstream parties across established democracies have recently been challenged with phenomena such as rapid membership- and electoral decline and are even in some cases kicked out of government. Many scholars investigated these challenges as perceived “shocks” by parties and linked this directly to the implementation of several types of party reforms such as programmatic- (e.g. position change), organizational- (e.g. implementation of party democratization processes), and personnel reforms (e.g. candidate or leadership turnover).  From these studies we know that parties who are in such a vulnerable environment are likely to implement party reforms. Yet, little is known if, and to what extent, these multiple party reforms actually pay off for the parties implementing them. By focusing on 34 mainstream parties across 10 established democracies over a period of 33 years, this paper investigates whether party reforms are able to make the party perform better in the next election. In doing so, this study adds to the existing literature on party reforms in several ways.

First, scholars mostly study party reforms as the dependent variable by disentangling the causes that leads to a certain type of party reform. Yet, party reforms are often implemented to serve a purpose, namely adapting towards a challenging environment. Thereby party elites expect certain results (e.g. electoral success) caused by a party reform. This study places party reforms as independent variable to explain electoral consequences. 
Second, there are no studies – to my knowledge – that investigate the electoral effects of different types of party reforms in an integrated framework. This is however highly relevant as the different party reforms often aim to address the same challenges into the scope of adapting towards a (same) changing environment. Thereby parties do not only present reforms on their programmatic profile for instance, but instead reforms on multiple components of a broader indivisible political product. In this paper, the components of the political product are programmatic-, organizational- and personnel identity. The literature has typically focused on identifying electoral success caused by reforms on an individual component of the political product (i.e. programmatic-, organisational- and personnel identity) (e.g. Abou-Chadi (2016) and Somer-Topcu (2015) on programmatic reforms, Gauja (2016) and Pedersen and Schumacher (2015) on organizational reforms, Cross and Pilet (2015) on leadership reforms and Hjermitslev (2020)). I argue, however, that the electoral effects of party reforms are conditional upon one another. 

Hence, this paper seeks to answer which combinations of party reforms that mainstream parties have adopted lead to immediate electoral success. In this paper I will conduct several multivariate regression analysis investigating the electoral consequences of different combinations of party reforms (i.e. a reform in policy position, a change of party leader, a change of democratization processes and a change of governmental status) in 34 mainstream parties across 10 established democracies during 1986-2019.",Ghent University,,,,,,,,Ghent University,,Jasmien Luypaert,,,,,,,,Jasmien Luypaert,,Comparative Politics,Elections,Political Leadership,Political Parties,Regression,Electoral Behaviour,Policy Change,,Reform to perform?

This aim is a much-diluted version of the radical goals of youth-led and youth-driven environmental movements calling for rapid and systemic change, as well as their radical repertoires of contention involving non-violent direct action and at times civil disobedience in the form of disruptive Do-It-Ourselves (DIO) politics.

Instead, Young Greens opts for a reformist approach to obtain change through lobbying, voting and standing for election, especially at the local level. Magid Magid (born 1989), a Somalian child refugee and Green Party member who became Lord Mayor of Sheffield in 2018 and then a Green Party MEP in 2019 is an exception rather than the rule regarding the successes of this reformist path. 

At a time when youth voice, young environmental activists and radical climate protest actions are so prominent, why do some young people choose to pay a membership fee and become a member of Young Greens? Why do they decide to join a youth and student wing that advocates reformist politics operating through hierarchical parliamentary structures? What is the appeal of Young Greens? Is there any cross-over between environmental movement activists and youth wing activists? Why don’t more young people join Young Greens? 

This paper is a case study of Young Greens in England and Wales today. It addresses the structure, sphere of influence within the Green Party, stated aims, campaigns, communication and methods of Young Greens. The paper draws on a long-term study of this youth wing and the author’s recent interviews with members (as well as its equivalent in France).",Université de Paris I – Panthéon-Sorbonne,,,,,,,,Université de Paris I – Panthéon-Sorbonne,,Sarah Pickard,,,,,,,,Sarah Pickard,,Political Parties,Party Members,Youth,,,,,,"Reformist and/not radical?

0,"The Brexit, EU’s green deal and the pandemic recovery package have facilitated transformation towards greater sustainability in several policy areas by impacting the actor preferences and the decision-making setting. The purpose of this paper is to explore the impact of the reformist context on EU’s agricultural policy by focusing on the CAP 2023-2027 reform. The paper argues that the reformist context has strengthened the position of pro-reform actors in the relations between and within the Commission, Council and European parliament, but that the impact depended on the extent to which status quo preferred by conservative players was actually changed and negotiaitons setting including various issue linkages and veto players. The analysis of preferences of the three institutions and  outcomes of the negotiations process in the period 2018-2021 supports the argument and further shows how the outcomes while falling short of more substantive reforms have introduced several symbolic wins corresponding to the attempts of the reformist players to save their image and the image of CAP.

0,"While the economic collapse prompted by the Covid-19 pandemic and culminating in the largest European fiscal stimulus package to date has revived the public debate on European fiscal integration policies, citizens’ opinions towards such policies remain to be fully explored. Particularly, the effect of subnational regional contexts is currently understudied. We add to this lacuna by joining regional level indicators with data from a conjoint survey experiment assessing European citizens’ preferences towards multidimensional fiscal capacity instruments in 5 European countries (DE, ES, FR, IT, NL; 8570 respondents, 87 regions). We exploit the fact that the conjoint experiment was fielded in a unique point in time, namely amidst the height of the Covid-19 pandemic’s first wave in Europe, to test whether early differences in regional infection rates impact European fiscal policy preferences. We find that regional level self-interest plays a significant role in moderating individual preferences. Citizens in poorer regions and in regions struck more heavily by the Covid-19 pandemic are more supportive of European fiscal integration policies if they are intended to be redistributive, if they increase taxation of the rich, if they refrain from budgetary conditions, and if they withhold automatic termination and fines in case of non-compliance. Furthermore, in wealthier regions, the positive effect of high incidence rates on support for packages that impose termination and fines in case of non-compliance increases. Hence, when formulating political opinions regarding European fiscal integration, people prefer what is best for their region while also considering the impact of the pandemic.

0,"The last decade has witnessed growing attention to the involvement of the so-called 'third level' of governance, i.e. the subnational or regional level, in EU affairs. Research focused e.g. on the emergence of regional offices in Brussels or institutional response to the Lisbon Treaty, which brought along a strengthening of the subnational dimension in multilevel EU governance – at least theoretically. Such institutional changes come along with an increased demand for information on European issues for regional-level political actors. In the context of the new provisions for subsidiarity control, this is also the case for regional MPs, who lack other formal mechanisms for shaping EU policy-making. To tackle this challenge, however, regional MPs can draw on informal ways to get involved in EU affairs. Our paper focuses on regional MPs' EU-related networking activities as one of these ways. Drawing on a survey conducted in seven EU member states, we examine the cooperation efforts maintained by regional MPs with various actors for the purpose of information exchange and influence seeking on EU affairs. We, first provide a descriptive depiction of such contacts: which actors do regional MPs address and for what purpose. Applying cluster analysis methods, we uncover the different  strategies that regional MPs tend to follow. Secondly, we seek to explain variation in the use of the various strategies by considering differences in the institutional framework at the national and regional level. Introducing new survey data, our findings contribute to the comparative study of subnational involvement in multilevel EU governance.",Danube University Krems,REGIOPARL | Regional Parliaments Lab,,,,,,,REGIOPARL | Regional Parliaments Lab,,Sarah Meyer,Mario Wolf,,,,,,,Mario Wolf,,European Union,Parliaments,Comparative Perspective,,,,,,Regional MPs' cooperation efforts in EU affairs from a comparative angle,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64614&EventID=185
0,"Brazil was, at some point, the epicentre of the global pandemic, having reached the excruciating figure of more than 600000 deaths, with peaks of more than 1000 deceased in a day in February and March 2021. The negationist rhetoric of Bolsonaro’s government highly contributed to the sketch of this scenario. The ineffectiveness in the purchase and distribution of vaccines and the propagation of discourses competing with the preventive health measures recommended by world health organisations were integral parts of this extreme right-wing government's performance. The absence of federal coordination against the pandemic made the work of state governments and parliaments very central to the development and application of policies aimed at mitigating the social and economic effects of Covid-19. 
Against this backdrop, this article proposes an analysis of the federative responses to the pandemic through a case study of the Rio de Janeiro Legislative Assembly (ALERJ). In this case, Rio de Janeiro stands for as a sample of Brazilian politics as one of Bolsonaro’s most relevant electoral wards, where he holds a considerable political and social base. On the other hand, Rio de Janeiro is the state of Marielle Franco, a Black women politician assassinated in 2018 who became a symbol of human rights defenders and an icon of the progressive left in the country. In this sense, at least on the regional spectrum, Rio de Janeiro is a stage on which Brazilian political antagonisms become even more evident. Concerning the Covid-19 pandemic, Rio de Janeiro was the second most affected since it is home to several densely populated metropolitan regions around its capital. Thus, this federal-state represents an interesting microcosm of Brazilian politics and a way of understanding the emerging and structural conflicts that arose from responses to this situation. 
With this in mind, my focus in this article is to analyse the parliamentary responses to Covid, between February and March 2021, at this particular Legislative House. By responses, I consider the proposed bills related to Covid-19 and the speeches and discussions that cover this agenda. I selected this period because these months were marked by the peak of deaths and infections and the arrival of vaccines on national territory. 
Employing Covid-19 as a lens, this article aims to answer the following questions: What issues are addressed in parliament with direct or indirect associations to the pandemic? How is the sanitary crisis utilised as a prism to address other structural problems such as the economy, public health and education? What antagonistic articulations are revealed, and how do they relate to the national political context? In answering these questions, I aim to understand what kinds of responses have been given to the pandemic in Rio de Janeiro and what other concerns arise through the pandemic as a rubric. Furthermore, I intend to situate the local debate within the national political context and understand how political/ideological positions are reflected in the legislative actions aimed at giving answers to the crises imposed by the pandemic.",University of Bielefeld,,,,,,,,University of Bielefeld,,Livia de Souza Lima,,,,,,,,Livia de Souza Lima,,Local Government,Parliaments,Representation,Political Sociology,Policy-Making,,,,"Regional Parliaments as Pandemic Stages: Emergencies, Structural Crisis and Antagonisms",https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=62701&EventID=185
0,"Tech companies’ growing responsibilities are well established in diverse areas including infrastructure, education, or health. Similarly, there is substantial research on the role of private security companies in border management, defence, and cybersecurity. Yet, this paper suggests that these different branches of literature do not speak to each other sufficiently, creating a gap between the branch that explores the diverse power sources of tech companies and the branch that investigates the challenges of capacity and accountability of private security companies. Insights on public-private interactions in digital security are typically limited to single areas such as cybersecurity or illegal content. To understand the challenges public actors face in regulating them, this paper suggests that we need to grasp the role of tech companies as security agents more comprehensively. To bridge the existing gap, this paper analyses different types of tech companies and their security decision-making in the European context. Conceptually, it distinguishes between reactive and proactive tech security companies. Reactive companies hold data or content that is relevant to law enforcement agencies and have to judge on the legitimacy of cooperation requests, such as Microsoft. Proactive companies develop software or technologies that enable security decision-making, such as the Israeli NSO Group or the US company Palantir. The paper shows that while reactive companies may have more to gain from regulation, both types create similar regulatory difficulties. The informal and/or opaque nature of cooperation as well as asymmetrical dependencies incentivize security actors to limit rather than extend regulation. The paper discusses a third, hybrid type of companies that both develop technologies for security decision-making and hold significant amounts of data, such as Amazon or Google. It argues that for these hybrid companies, regulatory difficulties are intensified because of the multiple roles they assume in the negotiation of regulation. The paper illustrates the typology in the context of three key areas that represent typical challenges of regulating tech companies in security: electronic evidence, private surveillance technologies and spyware, and the use of artificial intelligence in law enforcement and defence. Three qualitative case studies focus on key controversies and regulation attempts in Europe. These areas are subject to ongoing processes of negotiation and political debate, making their thorough understanding a key objective for the development of adequate regulatory responses.",University of Vienna,,,,,,,,University of Vienna,,Anke Sophia Obendiek,,,,,,,,Anke Sophia Obendiek,,Cyber Politics,European Union,Governance,Business,Technology,Big Data,,,Regulating security decision-making by private tech companies,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63658&EventID=185
0,"This paper aims at providing a systematic stocktaking of the policy measures taken as part of a Circular Economy (CE) agenda to address health, environmental, and resource challenges posed by plastics. CE is an economic system that replaces the ‘end-of-life’ concept with reducing, alternatively reusing, recycling, and recovering materials in production and consumption processes to accomplish sustainable development. It has become a key concept that guides the environmental policy agenda in many jurisdictions across the globe, including Asia and Europe. With the CE policy agenda gaining traction, we see a growth of CE-oriented policies,  as many governments have gradually intensified their efforts to improve the efficiency of primary resource use, reduce waste production and increase material recovery and reuse. In parallel, there is increased effort by corporations to adopt industry standards, voluntary agreements and develop CE business models
The purpose of the research is twofold: first, to assess empirically the degree of adoption of policies and regulations addressing plastics in OECD countries; second, to explore theoretically and empirically the conditions and drivers under which this policy output is emerging.
While in past years, the importance of CE policies has grown significantly, the evolving interdisciplinary literature on CE has not systematically taken stock of the increase and diversity of CE policies and regulations. Compared to other areas of environmental law and policy-making, there is a crucial lack of systematic cross-temporal and cross-country data on this emerging field of regulation. 
To systematically address the dynamics in CE plastics regulation, the paper uses analyzes the private and public regulation adopted between the years 2000 to 2021  in a sample of 12 OECD countries (both EU and non-EU). The paper uses a two-dimensional policy portfolio approach that captures the policy targets (‘what is regulated?’) and the policy instruments (‘how is it regulated?’). Using this two-dimensional approach promises to capture both the number and the diversity of policy instruments used to achieve CE goals in the plastics value chain. It will allow us to refine our understanding of how comprehensive the scope of regulation is in different countries in terms of the targets and the legal and regulatory tools used to address these targets.",Friedrich-Alexander Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg,Open University of Israel,Universitetet i Oslo,,,,,,Friedrich-Alexander Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg,,Sandra Eckert,Orr Karassin,Yves Steinebach,,,,,,Sandra Eckert,,Environmental Policy,Regulation,Comparative Perspective,,,,,,Regulating the Circular Economy and Plastics in the OECD World,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65622&EventID=185
0,"The revolving door is a socio-economic phenomenon whose policy salience is steadily gaining momentum among policymakers. Focusing on executive branches in charge of government debt management – debt management units (DMUs) –, this article delivers a case study systematically identifying circumstances and operations wherein the revolving door could lead to adverse side effects, and assesses whether the regulatory framework across OECD jurisdictions is adequate addressing the phenomenon’s risks. In government debt management, the revolving door is the horizontal movement of public officials to the dealers, and vice versa. Dealers are financial institutions appointed by DMUs to participate in government securities auctions, or exclusively enhancing sovereign debt market liquidity. Showing how the revolving door could exacerbate conflicts of interests inherent such principal-agent relationship, this paper reveals that the regulation in force presents limitations. Policy recommendations advocate broadening the legislation’s scope, the mandatory disclosure of public officials’ personal assets, the introduction of ad hoc cooling-off periods, and greater transparency in DMU’s ‘grey’ areas of governance.

This contribution sheds light on two dimensions of policymaking. First, providing a taxonomy of circumstances wherein the revolving door poses a potential risk, the article aims at safeguarding the integrity and sustainability of sovereign debt management.

0,"Derecognition of statehood by international organisations, states and other entities of the international society is a constituting element of the international sphere. Besides the practices of recognition and non-recognition, it contributes fundamentally to the formation of the international society. Moreover, this phenomenon is of elementary importance for the reality of the existence of the affected subject itself.
In contrast to its relevance, the phenomenon of derecognition itself is currently characterised by the existence of an extensive research gap. This lack of research not only manifests itself in the issue that the number of concrete acts of derecognition is often contentious even for specific subjects but is also accompanied by a conceptual fuzziness. 
This paper aims to shed light on this fuzziness by discussing the interrelation of different sub-ordinated and linked phenomena like frozen recognitions, suspensions of recognitions and direct and indirect withdrawals. Furthermore, the often misinterpreted relation between recognition and derecognition, while the latter is more than just the absence or negation of the former, is reflected as well.
Based on these theoretical debates, the practice of derecognition of the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic or so-called Western Sahara is elaborated more deeply. In doing so, the paper addresses to what extent SADR’s derecognition is based on external factors instead of configurations of the derecognised object itself. This includes addressing aspects of patronage and an actively involved base state.
Furthermore, this paper provides first insides in ongoing methodological considerations on the study of derecognition and therefore moves beyond a purely conceptual discussion.",Otto-von-Guericke University Magdeburg,,,,,,,,Otto-von-Guericke University Magdeburg,,Tina Rosner-Merker,,,,,,,,Tina Rosner-Merker,,Africa,Foreign Policy,International Relations,Qualitative Comparative Analysis,Empirical,,,,Rejecting statehood in various forms - Reflection on different forms of Derecognition by States: A Case Study on Western Sahara,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63623&EventID=185
0,"Religion has a significant – and under-appreciated – effect on how Europeans feel about the European Union and has had an important impact on how people voted in the UK’s ‘Brexit Referendum’.

Using the British Election Study and the Understanding Society data, we show that while religion was certainly not the only or most influential characteristic to explain Brexit or the tumultuous years that followed, it did play an important and under-appreciated role in explaining why a sizeable chunk of British voters were more likely to vote ‘Leave’ in 2016 than we may otherwise expect. It also contributed to the rising salience of Euroscepticism as a political issue that helped put pressure on David Cameron to hold a referendum on EU membership in the first place, and the stunning victory for Boris Johnson’s Conservative Party in the 2019 general election that all but confirmed that the UK would in fact leave the European Union.

0,"My contribution will focus on the role of religion in electoral behaviour among voters of the Rassemblement National (RN) of Marine Le Pen, the most central populist radical right (PRR) party in contemporary France. Various quantitative surveys have established that the majority of French PRR voters are secular voters or Catholic/Christian non-practicing believers. Drawing on a qualitative study made of in-depth interviews with RN voters (n = 42), my presentation will confirm that, when asked about their religious beliefs, RN voters indeed answer that they are non-believers or of little faith, often even suspicious towards religious institutions. However, I will argue that religion still subjectively plays a role in their electoral choices, but as the expression of a cultural – more than religious strictly speaking – identity. Indeed, when they talk about religion, RN voters most often refer, in a positive way, to a strong national attachment, or, in a negative way, to Muslim religion, considered as a threat to ‘French’ traditions, lifestyles and values. On this last point, my empirical material shows that it is not Islam per se (as a religious dogma) that is criticized, but a set of attitudes and practices attributed to French extra-European immigrants. 
To sum up, my contribution will demonstrate that religion plays a role in RN vote not as a marker of individual religious socialization nor as a set of religious beliefs, but as a ‘thin’ identity which can be subjectively activated in electoral behaviour. The presentation will also be an opportunity to highlight the advantages of qualitative analysis in the study of electoral behaviour and of religious subjectivities, in a complementary manner to quantitative studies.

0,"Introduction

Space heating accounts for more than a quarter of the final energy demand in the EU and is still largely based on imported fossil fuels. Natural gas remains the main energy carrier for generating heat in buildings in many European countries, e.g. Germany, Belgium or Italy. This makes the heating sector a primary target for decarbonization. However, as long-lived fossil-fuel systems are only slow to be replaced, short-term solutions are becoming important: Drop-in renewable gases like Biomethane or Synthetic Natural Gas (SNG) could play a central role in this regard. On a supranational level directives like the RED II already mandate an increased uptake of renewables in the heating sector. Furthermore, many countries have created political frameworks for voluntary renewable gas markets. However, the share of renewable gas in the European gas grid is still only marginal. Robust green demand for renewable gases could help fulfilling the targets set in the Paris Agreement. Yet existing research focuses on the supply side and technical aspects of renewable gases, leaving the demand side and consumer preferences largely neglected. Against this backdrop we raise the following research questions:
(1) Which attributes of renewable gas products are how important to consumers in the heating market?
(2) Which consumer groups can be identified based on their preferences for different product attributes?

Methods

Our study builds upon a Discrete-Choice-Experiment implemented through an online survey. We determine consumer preferences and their differences between consumer segments through part-worth utilities on a pseudo-individual level. These utilities are derived from a hierarchical Bayes estimation approach. 
Our study design comprised 11 choice tasks, where participants had to make a decision between four renewable gas products and one default option (=100% natural gas). The products were made up of the combination of six relevant attributes (e.g. share of renewable gas, labels, price) and their levels (e.g. 5% SNG share, two labels, 10% price increase). We calculated an individual yearly price of the default product for each participant using individual residential parameters (i.e. dwelling type, refurbishment status, living space).
Data collection in June 2021 yielded 523 responses. Our study is situated in Germany, however we consider our results applicable to other national settings with an existing and developing biomethane market and a high dependency on natural gas. 

Results and discussion

Our first (preliminary) results indicate that the share of renewables and the yearly price influence the purchasing decision comparably strongly. While labels and the biomethane feedstock are equally, but of lower general importance, the supplier type and the aspect of regionality can be considered as relatively unimportant. Zooming in, we see that especially products with lower renewable shares and lower prices are preferred. Regarding labels attached to products, quantity seems to matter: Products with more labels are clearly preferred over those with less labels. Our results can help explaining individual behavior patterns regarding renewable gases. Furthermore, they can inform political decision making in developing voluntary green markets (further) and help meeting the targets as e.g. formulated in the RED II.",Nuertingen-Geislingen University,Ruprecht-Karls-Universität Heidelberg,,,,,,,Ruprecht-Karls-Universität Heidelberg,,Carsten Herbes,Benedikt Rilling,,,,,,,Benedikt Rilling,,Quantitative,Decision Making,Public Opinion,Survey Research,Technology,Energy,Energy Policy,,Renewable gases in the heating market: Identifying consumer preferences through a Discrete-Choice Experiment,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65176&EventID=185
0,"In our current age characterized by significant technological development, tools such as artificial intelligence have been gradually applied in the search for solutions to various issues and challenges society has encountered. The emergence and progress of technology within the era of globalization and internationalization have transformed the paradigms of time and space, generating multiple devices applied to the work place, education systems, urban planning, the health field and many administrative functions, among others, including new regulations and strategies employed in the control of individuals.
Following the so-called 'refugee crisis' in 2015, the European Commission resolved to vastly expand its border control resources in order to tackle migration flows coming through its external borders. In particular, new automated high-tech tools were seen as a natural transition on the path to finding a unified solution for “managing” the migratory phenomenon. However, certain policies and measures implemented created a number of legal quandaries.
Apart from the efficiency that comes from the use of automated systems, there is an on-going debate about the biases and risks that weigh on people's rights - which, in turn, can generate or deepen an increase of discrimination, social segmentation and even exclusion of migrant groups. From this perspective, it is important to determine the impact of technological innovations when they call into question or undermine enshrined human rights recognized by the European Union.

0,"The last decade has seen the rise of Twitter as one of the most essential instruments of political communication and power. It appears that Twitter has been far more effectual in reaching the masses and even voicing the masses than what the traditional media has historically been able to do. In this proposal, we investigate narratives surrounding Islam on the French Twitter, its correlation with gender discrimination and the EU immigrant crisis and how it is construed as a social threat in media. I begin by underlining that there is no country devoid of gender disparity and no Western country is immune to discrimination towards Muslims either. Based on my preliminary Twitter data, and using femonationalism as an ideology, critical discourse analysis and mixed methods the paper tries to study that Twitter users are observing a principally malicious label of Muslims perpetrated by the usual suspects like big media houses and politicians, as identified by actor analysis. We use mixed computational methodologies like topic modelling (top2vec) to observe their varied theme surrounding Islam . 

This large-scale investigation of divisive inequitable discourse on Twitter with gendered narratives is expected to advance our sociological understanding of communal methods that (re-)produce disparities in France. Overall, the paper is expected to enhance understanding of the link between framing, power, group, interests, and inequalities. Moreover, these narratives could prevent the ‘native’ French people from properly comprehending the true nature of Muslims, whom they would continue to fear, discriminate and otherize from the 'native' French, thereby constructing a France that is the very opposite of the nation it was founded to be – a nation built on the ideals of liberté, égalité, fraternité. Finally, the project would also help us understand if the emergent political ecologies like Twitter voice the margins at all, and if so, 'Can the subaltern speak?'",Sciences Po Paris,,,,,,,,Sciences Po Paris,,Sreya Nath,,,,,,,,Sreya Nath,,Gender,Islam,Media,Migration,Feminism,Mixed Methods,,,Representation of Margins in Emergent Political Communication Ecologies:  Narratives around Islam on French Twitter,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63202&EventID=185

However, while CAs on diverse topics are increasingly popular among scholars, citizens, and policymakers alike, little is known about how and to what extent CAs represent its constituents, particularly the women and marginalized groups. This paper aims to informing this important inquiry based on the empirical findings from eight neighborhood level CAs (tolebhela) across Nepal. I interviewed in-depth 63 participants and non-participants of tolebhela along with local representatives. I also recorded deliberations as they happened; and administered a random household survey (N=237) at the neighborhoods that organized tolebhela, and at the neighborhoods that did not. Drawing on these along with the municipal government’s archives, this paper seeks to answer 1) what does representation mean in this context? 2) how do women and marginalized represent their agendas at tolebhela and why do they succeed (or fail) to include them in government policies? and 3) what representative functions do the tolebhela and the local representatives serve particularly to include minorities in municipal governance?",Australian National University,,,,,,,,Australian National University,,Souvidhya Khadka,,,,,,,,Souvidhya Khadka,,Democracy,Democratisation,Local Government,Political Participation,Representation,Agenda-Setting,,,Representative functions of neighborhoods level citizens assemblies in Nepal,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65901&EventID=185
0,"The literature on representative bureaucracy argues that public administrations achieve better outcomes for the population they serve if they are similar in sociodemographic features and attitudes to this population (e.g., Riccucci & Van Ryzin 2017). Empirically, the literature focuses primarily on representativeness in terms of class, ethnicity, and gender (Ding et al. 2021; Bishu & Kennedy 2020). An assumption that is central to the theory but often remains implicit is that similarity in sociodemographic features leads to a similarity in attitudes. This project explicitly explores similarity in attitudes, especially attitudes related to national identity. It builds on recent advances in sociology about the conceptualization of nationalism and the multiple dimensions of nationalist attitudes: attachment, membership, pride, hubris (Bonikowski & DiMaggio 2016; Bonikowski 2017; 2021). The main purpose is exploratory and descriptive: Using various surveys (World Value Survey, European Value Survey, International Social Survey Program), the paper maps nationalist attitudes among public employees in several countries. These attitudes are compared to those of the general population, and the relative gaps (or overlaps) between public and public servants’ attitudes are compared across countries.

This comparative-descriptive mapping is a useful first step necessary to address causal questions: Does sociodemographic similarity explain or ensure similarity in nationalist attitudes? Which country-specific factors can explain a larger or smaller gap in nationalist attitudes between the public and public servants: civil service systems (Van der Meer et al. 2015), administrative traditions (Painter & Peters 2010; Peters 2021), or others? The paper also discusses normative implications: Is representativeness good when it comes to nationalist attitudes? Or does it reproduce stereotypes of societal majorities to the detriment of minority groups, leading to the biased provision of public services?

The paper further contributes to the growing literature on populism and bureaucracy (Bauer et al. 2021) by discussing the role of public servants’ attitudes in turbulent political environments. Norms are an important dimension of the bureaucracy (Bauer et al. 2021; Bauer & Becker 2020). Bureaucrats’ norms and ideas about who is a legitimate member of the nation and how central the nation should be in public decision-making and service delivery are particularly relevant when the bureaucracy is instrumentalized by populist politicians whose narratives and ideologies are often linked with nationalism. How compatible bureaucrats’ norms are with such ideologies and goals may be one explanation for cross-country variation in bureaucratic resilience to populist influences.",Bocconi University,,,,,,,,Bocconi University,,Marlene Jugl,,,,,,,,Marlene Jugl,,National Identity,Nationalism,Populism,Public Administration,Representation,Comparative Perspective,Public Opinion,Survey Research,Representative nationalism?

0,"Refugees are underrepresented in political decision-making on migration politics. Would the inclusion of refugees in democratic innovations such as citizens’ assemblies improve their underrepresentation or would it merely gloss over the more fundamental problems of refugee agency? I show that refugee inclusion in democratic innovations raises a number of political challenges relating to the institutions’ intended purpose, design, process, and competence. In this paper, I focus on one major problem: the problem of territorial presence. Many proposals restrict participatory entitlements to resident migrants and refugees, overstating the the “premium of territorial arrival” (Shachar 2020; Benhabib 2020). But how can we rethink democratic inclusion and representation in processes of migration politics without overemphasizing territorial presence? How can refugees and migrants who are still on the move be included and represented in times of shifting borders? I argue that rethinking refugee representation can contribute to democratizing both democratic innovations and migration politics. I build on a recent contribution to feminist democratic theory to call for the institutionalization of affected representatives, account giving and group advocacy in the context of refugee representation in democratic innovations (Childs/Celis 2020).

0,"Research on organizational reputation of public sector agencies gained significant attention in the last years. Scholars explored how reputational concerns influence the behavior of public bodies and how bureaucratic autonomy is linked with reputation and reputational management. Regardless of these stimulating debates, the international organizations (IOs) scholarship has largely remained quarantined from these developments. This article aims to fill the gap in our understanding of organizational reputation in the context of IOs and international public administrations (IPAs). It rectifies the concept of organizational reputation for the study of change, behavior and activities of IOs/IPAs. In addition, it identifies four specific challenges IOs/IPAs face in their reputational management. The empirical section illustrates the new insights that accounts based on studying organizational reputation offer to the field of IOs/IPAs. The first case study discusses the emergence of the World Bank as a global economic research center in the mid-1960s; the second case analyzes the Bank’s response to an unprecedented public controversy about its Doing Business report in late 2021.",Università di Bologna,,,,,,,,Università di Bologna,,Mirek Tobias Hosman,,,,,,,,Mirek Tobias Hosman,,Development,Governance,International Relations,Public Administration,Constructivism,Global,International,World Bank,"Reputation, Bureaucratic Autonomy, and International Organizations: Research at the World Bank and the Doing Business Controversy",https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63250&EventID=185
0,"Research funding agencies play a key role in the governance of public research. Universities rely on their funding to cover research projects and to pay temporary, and sometimes also permanent, staff. The funding agencies, on their part, rely on peer reviewers in assessing the projects to fund. Thus, the steering of public funding for research is regulated with peer review as a buffer – or mediator – between politics and science.
While the role of peers in grant review is perceived a cornerstone in the autonomy and self-governances of science, we see that researchers complain about how their research projects are assessed by funding agencies and often display distrust in their review procedures. With increased external funding comes an increased reliance on grant peer review, but we also see a system under pressure. Funding agencies often need to handle higher numbers of proposals within flat budgets while the grant applicants face low success rates and are critical to review systems, and the trust in the system seems to be weakening. Researchers complain that the evaluations of their proposals are biased, favouring specific research topics and methods or review outcome appears random, and also decided by luck. Meanwhile, success in prior grant competitions appear to increase possibilities for success in future grant competitions, as well as being crucial for research careers. Grant peer review has thus become a more important part of the research system.
In this paper we will explore the conditions under which researchers have confidence in assessments of their research and trust grant review. May trust in grant review be kept in a system with low success rates and reviewer fatigue? Trust is called the glue of society – it keeps us together and makes things run more smoothly and flexibly. It is also a key component for a resilient research system. Trust in science seems generally based on the sources’ expertise, integrity and benevolence (Hendrics et al 2016). For trust in peer review, previous research points to competence – as defined by the reviewed – as the important factor (Hattke et al. 2018).
In the paper we draw on a rich survey material on researchers’ views on who has the ability to evaluate the quality of their research. The data covers researchers in three fields in five countries (economics, cardiologist and physicist in Denmark, Norway, the Netherlands, Sweden and the UK) and is coupled with bibliometric data. 
The data indicates that researchers’ trust in the competences of grant reviewers is far lower than their trust in the competences used for reviewing papers submitted to journals, or their colleagues’ ability to assess their research.

0,"According to many experts, intra-European radical beliefs have their roots in group-based feelings of insecurity, discrimination, deprivation, unfairness, injustice, and perceived threat. We propose to look at the question of radicalization from a perspective of group membership. If radicalization is a product of group membership, investigating the (mis)perceptions that groups have about each other’s values, worldviews and intergroup intentions becomes crucial. Indeed, people interpret their social context (i.e., relationships between groups, or intergroup relations) in terms of 'us' versus 'them': what is the current social norm in my group, and what does the other group think about my group? These (meta-)perceptions are often negative and inaccurate, causing fundamental and seemingly unbridgeable misunderstandings within and between groups. 
In this paper, we first study the concordance and divergence between three perspectives: own attitudes about the outgroup, ingroup attributed beliefs (what I think my ingroup thinks about my outgroup), and outgroup attributed beliefs or meta-perceptions (what I think my outgroup thinks about my ingroup). We empirically investigate how grievances and feelings of resentment translate in (biased) attributed beliefs and (mis)perceptions between group, and how perceptions of ingroup-outgroup polarization manifest. Second, we scrutinize how these three perspectives may crystalize in negative intergroup attitudes, prejudice and support for radical behavior. 
We have recent data from a large random probability sample in Belgium (Belgian National Election Study 2021, N = 1500) to study these questions, while taking into account potential geospatial variation in attributed beliefs. Preliminary results point out that the tendency to follow one’s own beliefs, regardless of the position of the outgroup, defines negative intergroup attitudes and support for violence in protest activities against the building of a mosque. At the same time, it is the ingroup that plays a role, not the outgroup if one wants to show the influence of attributed norms.",University of Leuven,,,,,,,,University of Leuven,,cecil meeusen,,,,,,,,cecil meeusen,,Extremism,Political Violence,Immigration,Quantitative,Public Opinion,,,,"Resentment, (mis)perceptions of ingroup and outgroup beliefs, prejudice and support for radical behavior",https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64106&EventID=185
0,"Over the last few decades countries around the world have become increasingly likely to provide their citizens living abroad with electoral rights and many countries are also making it more convenient to use these rights. The expansion of electoral rights and discussions about the form they should take have spurred a vivid scholarly debate. But very little is known about what citizens living in the country of origin think about these rights. Considering that the electoral rights of citizens living abroad in some cases could have a substantial impact on the outcome of elections, this relative dearth of knowledge on the perspective of resident citizens on this topic is problematic. That said, asking resident citizens their views about electoral rights for non-resident citizens requires a carefully calibrated approach. First, it is a complicated issue on which political theorists hold diverging opinions, and where practical electoral arrangements vary greatly across countries. Some countries provide wide-ranging rights; others provide their citizens living abroad with no or very limited electoral rights. Second, it is an issue that is quite distant from the daily lives of most resident citizens. They generally have no experience of voting from abroad and little knowledge of what that may imply. To address these issues and to gain a more informed (resident) citizen view of the electoral rights of non-resident citizens we employ a survey experiment using vignettes in five European countries (Belgium, Finland, Poland, Portugal, Ireland) with very different legislation on electoral rights for non-resident citizens (n=5x1200). We study how attitudes toward external voting rights and the right to stand as a candidate from abroad are affected by vignettes where different combinations of arguments in favour and against external electoral rights are presented to the respondents. This will reveal how citizens evaluate central claims from the literature on the electoral rights of non-resident citizens and it will also assess how the country context makes a difference to how attitudes on the issue are formed.",University of Helsinki,University of Warsaw,"Instituto Português de Relações Internacionais, IPRI-NOVA",University of Helsinki,University College Cork,,,,University of Helsinki,,Staffan Himmelroos,Magdalena Lesinska,Marco Lisi,Johanna Peltoniemi,Theresa Reidy,,,,Staffan Himmelroos,,Citizenship,Migration,Voting,Experimental Design,,,,,Resident Citizens’ Attitudes to Electoral Rights for Non-resident Citizens in Five EU Countries,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64067&EventID=185
0,"The rise of new revision powers presents a challenge to the rules, norms, and practices underpinning many current IOs, created and hitherto dominated by liberal western states. Contestation also emanates from within liberal democracies due to growing suspicion of globalization and the rise of populism. As a result, deadlocked negotiations, membership withdrawals, boycotts, and budget cuts or freezes are common challenges for many contemporary IOs. How can IOs respond to such challenges? To explore this question, it is instructive to consider how IOs have been affected by, and reacted to, global power shifts and growing nationalism and populism in the past. The last period of hyper-nationalism, deglobalisation, and IO membership flight began in the late-1920s and lasted until the end of WWII. Protectionism rose, authoritarian populism spread in Europe and beyond, and many states withdrew from League of Nations and other multilateral organizations. Many IOs terminated during this period or saw their memberships, mandates and budgets significantly reduced. Yet others survived and continued to thrive. My paper will use archival research to explore how IO secretariats and supportive policymakers sought to mobilize institutional resources to withstand populist-nationalist challenges and reinforce institutional legitimacy during the first era of deglobalization. My preliminary research points to a set of successful ‘coping strategies’ which IOs have utilized in the past, including withdrawing from highly politicized issues, adopting a more intergovernmental decision-making approach on contentious matters, seeking new bases of support among ‘neutral’ governments and transnational communities, and drawing on resources from private actors. By further exploring these strategies I hope to advance our understanding of contestation management in IOs, and thus their resilience in times of pressure.",University of Cambridge,,,,,,,,University of Cambridge,,Mette Eilstrup-Sangiovanni,,,,,,,,Mette Eilstrup-Sangiovanni,,Contentious Politics,Institutions,Nationalism,,,,,,Resilience in the face of crisis: How IOs survive member state contestation,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63414&EventID=185
0,"Among the many aspects of social life that changed during the pandemic, the area of social movements represents a particularly interesting part. In the first time and during the first lockdown, civil society activists often argued that the pandemic had set civic activism on hold, which could lead to a democratic decline. No long after that, however, protest activism increased - but it was activism and protest against state measures of pandemic containment. Starting in Mai 2020, the ‘Querdenken’ movement in Germany and similar movements in other countries increased, forming a broad coalition of political sceptics, as well as their own particular interpretation and argumentation schemes.
Since then, the ‘Querdenken’ movement, which was active with demonstrations in numerous cities, is characterized by strong heterogeneity and currently consists of a wide variety of social groups. Initial studies such as the Basel Study on the Political Sociology of the Corona Protest (Nachtwey et al. 2020) were able to show that participants in these protests are predominantly from the middle class, relatively often have an academic education, and in some cases pursue very conscious lifestyles - such as anthroposophy. Xenophobic or authoritarian attitudes were not overly pronounced, but a strong alienation from democratic institutions, parties, media, and procedures was obvious.
One of the most interesting aspects of this movement is its particular approach to science and knowledge: some of the movement activists are physicians or scientists who deny the danger of the virus, or they are autodidactically committed laypeople who in part intensively acquire scientific knowledge that supports their argumentation. However, the space of counter-knowledge built up in this way is highly selective, since it fundamentally eludes the method of dialogical contradiction or questioning of existing knowledge.
The question therefore arises how this counter-knowledge is produced by selective scientific perception and how it is used for mobilization. The article focuses not only on the scientific-medical perspective, but also on social-scientific knowledge about structures and procedures of complex democratic systems. The alienation of large parts of the movement from the democratic political system points to a ""democratic illiteracy"", as Margret Canovan (1999) has called the stimulus of authoritarian populism. To what extent, then, does the construction of medical-scientific and social-scientific counter-knowledge have the effect of reinforcing authoritarian attitudes? The central thesis of the paper is that the selective framing of scientific knowledge as part of mobilization contributes to the radicalization and thus the resilience of authoritarian and anti-pluralist movement patterns.",Europa-Universität Viadrina,,,,,,,,Europa-Universität Viadrina,,Susann Worschech,,,,,,,,Susann Worschech,,Democracy,Extremism,Populism,Knowledge,Political Sociology,Political Activism,Protests,Activism,"Resilience of the Authoritarian?

0,"At first glance, the European Union (EU) has reacted quite differently to the COVID-19 pandemic than to the Eurozone crisis when it comes to EU/Eurozone financial support mechanisms. The Eurozone crisis was an asymmetric crisis with presumably clear fault lines between “creditor” and “debtor” states. The COVID-19 pandemic is more symmetric, and has seen a shift in positions on the mutualisation of debt. While we are beginning to understand the effects of the pandemic on EU economic governance, we know surprisingly little about its implications for actor and policy coalitions in the European Parliament. Therefore, our paper asks: Which actor and policy coalitions emerged in the European Parliament as a response to the COVID-19 recovery efforts? 

Drawing on previous studies of EP coalition patterns during the Eurozone crisis, we conduct a Discourse Network Analysis (DNA) on debates focusing on the Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF) in order to determine to what extent the different coalitions were shaped by ideological (left-right; GAL/TAN) or geographical cleavages (North-South; East-West; “frugal four” vs. “friends of cohesion”). In doing so, this paper aims to understand which discourse coalitions were dominant, who formed them and why they were more successful than potential (policy) alternatives.",Universität Salzburg,Universität Salzburg,Universität Salzburg,,,,,,Universität Salzburg,Universität Salzburg,Ermela Gianna,Lucy Kinski,Ariadna Ripoll Servent,,,,,,Ermela Gianna,Lucy Kinski,Cleavages,European Union,Parliaments,Representation,European Parliament,,,,"Resilience, Recovery… and Fragmentation?

0,"Cities are seen as key for shaping the climate future. Many cities engage in transnational municipal networks and public policy mechanisms to mitigate and/or adapt to climate change and future challenges. A currently promoted public policy mechanism in the climate change adaptation literature is transformative adaptation. Transformative adaptation in climate literature and practice seeks to merge the concepts of resilience and sustainability to prepare for uncertain futures. Experimental, participatory, and reflexive planning modes take into account specific shocks and systemic stresses of (urban) systems. In this way, transformative adaptation assumedly advances profound systemic change in coping with disruptive events instead of dwelling upon (incremental) business-as-usual strategies. Empirical evidence on urban climate change adaptation points, however, to a technocratic, top-down understanding of adjustments to specific shocks without integrating system-wide stresses. The city strategies of the transnational 100 Resilient Cities (100 RC) initiative seemed promising for boosting a transformative turn in this regard as participating cities were required to link resilience actions to their most urgent shocks and stresses. However, 100RC received critique for reinforcing a neoliberal agenda that aims to activate self-help in vulnerable populations, shifting the security responsibility from the government to the citizen. Political science scholars frequently believe that in general, the resilience concept pays insufficient attention to justice and equity, and, thus, reproduces unequal or unjust systems and structures as an apolitical paradigm.

Against this background, we ask: Do RC strategies live up to the notion of transformative adaptation envisioning resilient and sustainable urban futures? Which notions of adaptation shape urban resilience planning over time and geographical location? And, are more transformative resilience strategies linked to more comprehensive sustainable adaptation practices in urban spaces? We examine 30 of the published 74 RC strategies from the timeline of first-, second-, and third-generation cities that balances geographic representation from the Global South and North. First, we develop a three-tier coding scheme that assesses (1) the perception of crisis and vulnerabilities, i.e. main perceived shocks and stresses for the city, (2) local participation in this assessment and respective planning, as well as (3) the strategic planning employed, which includes planning coherence, content, and mode in the envisioned approach within the resilience strategy. With this coding scheme, we aim to reflect transformative adaptation through the procedural policy approach a city engages with. Second, we assess whether more transformative resilience strategies are linked to more sustainable adaptation practices in urban spaces by examining the coverage of and balance between social, economic, and environmental Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) addressed in resilience strategies. Third, we perform a cluster analysis to trace whether the identified notions of adaptation vary or persist over time and/or geographical location. First results show that not only climate-related shocks but also social stresses, such as housing scarcity, are frequently considered. The main planning mode follows strategic partnerships with businesses to challenge such stresses, which reiterates the criticism of a neoliberal or apolitical understanding and implementation of resilience.",Leibniz Institute for Research on Society and Space,,Leibniz-Institute for Research on Society and Space,,,,,,Leibniz Institute for Research on Society and Space,,Elisa Kochskämper,Lisa-Maria Glaß,Wolfgang Haupt,,,,,,Elisa Kochskämper,,Environmental Policy,Local Government,UN,Climate Change,,,,,Resilient and sustainable?

0,"Every day both at the local and global scale, we experience and try to mitigate the negative consequences of decisions about land-use changes. The importance of the topic is well recognized among public and private actors, which is reflected in the current political agenda and fostered by the constantly growing interest in academia. Well-developed theories explaining the phenomena help to gain insights into the topic. However, they were mainly tested in urbanized areas. Hence there are missing answers to the questions of whether, and if so, to what extent these theories are helpful to explain land-use changes in non-urbanized areas. The dilemma posed is significant because property rights become more strict when the value or/and size of a resource is threatened. Therefore, this paper aims to fill this gap, and to this end, we apply comparative perspective between areas with greater resource scarcity and greater resource availability. 
With the above in mind, we embed our research in the theoretical concept of the political market and assume that land-use changes are the physical outcomes of interactions between land suppliers (local government) and land demanders (interest groups). Local governments are perceived as moderators of interest group pressure set in a specific context, and they favour those groups that can deliver greater political profits. The theoretical concept helps to answer the question: “What are the results of interaction between various interest groups and local governments for land-use changes in Poland?”. The research focuses on the actual policy outcomes, as we use Corine Land Cover (CLC) data intersected at the municipal level in Poland.

The results show that in the space of interaction in urbanized areas interest groups play a more important role in the observed changes meanwhile, in non-urbanized areas, the characteristics of local government have greater explanatory power.",University of Warsaw,University of Warsaw,,,,,,,University of Warsaw,,Justyna Ślawska,Katarzyna Szmigiel-Rawska,,,,,,,Katarzyna Szmigiel-Rawska,,Institutions,Interest Groups,Local Government,,,,,,Resource scarcity versus availability: comparative perspective on interaction between local government and interest groups in land-use changes in Poland,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64364&EventID=185
0,"Decision-making in many international organizations takes place in the shadow of differences in the representation of member states in decision-making bodies. Yet weak states occasionally block proposals of more powerful states and initiate change themselves. How? Approaches that approximate influence by voting shares and other structural features are ill-suited to explain this phenomenon. In this article, I examine the micro-foundations of state action by looking at the behavior and traits of representatives in governing bodies of international organizations. Drawing on an interdisciplinary literature on negotiation, I identify psychological and social-environmental features of successful negotiators. To assess which of those attributes apply to state delegates in global governance, I have conducted 16 interviews with former members of the International Monetary Fund’s governing body, its Executive Board—a typical case of decision-making in international organizations. Based on the analysis of these interviews, I develop the concept of ‘respected individuals’—state representatives who enjoy particular standing in decision-making bodies. Their influence and prestige depend on two conditions: first, autonomy vis-à-vis their home authorities; and second, relevant experience and negotiation skills. This concept plausibly extends beyond the IMF to other international institutions and multilateral negotiations. Taken together, I show how to combine institutional and individual-level features to advance our understanding of decision-making in international affairs.",Freie Universität Berlin,,,,,,,,Freie Universität Berlin,,Timon Forster,,,,,,,,Timon Forster,,Governance,Representation,Global,IMF,Influence,Member States,,,Respected individuals: How state representatives overcome structural constraints in international organizations,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63338&EventID=185
0,"Recent research has problematised the civic integration paradigm and aggressive integrationism, referring to (immigrant) integration as to be achieved by coercing, testing, penalising and, ultimately, excluding. This paper studies integration as a category of practice in Switzerland, where naturalisation and residency permits are increasingly predicated on integration requirements such as ‘respecting the values of the Federal Constitution’. Building on critical approaches to integration governance and what has been conceptualized as boundary liberalism, the paper enquires into the social imaginaries re/produced by integration policies and discourses. In line with Hadj Abdou, integration is understood and approached as a phenomenon that reveals more about those who articulate ideas about integration and decide on integration measures than it does about those who are the target of integration. Based on a qualitative approach, the empirical data consists of official documents and legislative processes, fieldwork and qualitative interviews among public authorities and street-level bureaucrats (both in the domain of naturalisation and foreigners’ law), and case law. The analysis reveals how everyday practices and the knowledge produced on integration and especially its value dimension presuppose and reproduce the social imaginary of society as a community of value (Anderson). As has been shown for other contexts especially in Europe, the extent to which those expected to integrate are believed to have acceptably liberal values has become a site of boundary making. The paper elaborates how, in the Swiss context, the value dimension of integration draws a bright, gendered, and nativist boundary against an imagined Swiss or European community of value. Analysing integration regimes and administrative practices in Switzerland, the paper shows how ideations of integration policies and regimes are re/produced and shape everyday practices, discourses and policy-making. On the basis of these empirical and theoretical perspectives on the Swiss context, the paper thus attempts to contribute to the ongoing and highly contested transnational debates on integration/ism. Above all, the paper concludes with a plea to leave behind integration imaginaries that picture society in terms of either social fragmentation and collapse, or complete harmony, stability, and cohesion.",Université de Neuchâtel,,,,,,,,Université de Neuchâtel,,Stefan Manser-Egli,,,,,,,,Stefan Manser-Egli,,Integration,Qualitative,Policy Implementation,,,,,,Respecting the Values of the Constitution: Integrationism and Boundary Liberalism in Switzerland,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64491&EventID=185

Socio-economic inequality, spatial segregation, and lower involvement of certain groups in political decision-making have led to growing participatory inequality in Amsterdam. Lower-educated young (16-27) people and young people with migrant backgrounds in particular believe that politicians speak a different language, do not recognize themselves in politicians, and do not see the topics that are important to them in the political debate. Most importantly, this group within the Amsterdam electorate displays very low levels of institutional and political trust, in addition to the low levels of political self-confidence (internal efficacy) that they hold. This is due to personal experiences of institutional exclusion and discrimination, low levels of political representation, and numerous recent examples of institutional racism in the Netherlands.

Our multivariate analysis showed that women are significantly less Eurosceptic on average, and people living in small and medium towns (compared to Budapest residents) are less likely to support HUXIT in a potential referendum. In accordance with our hypotheses, we confirmed that being a supporter of the governing Fidesz party, sharing culturally right-wing and economically left-wing political views significantly increases the individual level of Euroscepticism. Support for Fidesz and economic left-wing position increased the probability of HUXIT support. Our hypothesis about populist Euroscepticism could not be confirmed, as fear of losing social status and economic grievances did not influence our Euroscepticism index, while anti-elite stance had an opposite effect than expected. Economic grievances had a significant positive effect on the probability of voting for HUXIT. Authoritarian personality traits had a significant effect on both our Euroscepticism index scores and the probability of supporting HUXIT. Our hypotheses about the positive effect of international openness and psychological well-being were only partially confirmed. In line with our expectations, not being lonely in general, having foreign friends, and identification with cosmopolitan values significantly decreased Euroscepticism scores. Subjective well-being had a negative effect, but only on the probability of being pro-HUXIT. Speaking foreign languages did not have significant effects, while intense foreign experience positively correlated with Euroscepticism scores, and previously living abroad even increased the probability of supporting HUXIT.",Centre for Social Sciences,,,,,,,,Centre for Social Sciences,,Áron Szászi,,,,,,,,Áron Szászi,,European Union,Political Psychology,Euroscepticism,Survey Research,,,,,"Rethinking Euroscepticism: Affective, Behavioural and Cognitive Attitudes toward the EU in Hungary",https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65505&EventID=185
0,"Since the launch of the Lisbon strategy in 2000, considerable efforts have been made at the European level to advance integration in higher education under two separate yet interlinked pillars: the European Higher Education Area (EHEA) and the European Research Area (ERA). Grounded in the principle of differentiated integration, the EHEA and ERA have represented important drivers in the construction of a single market for education, even though characterized by an uneven implementation, overcrowded priorities and interests, and significant limitations in two of their key overarching aims: mobility and the achievement of convergence around common values. More recently, the Covid19 pandemic further challenges higher education, with different dynamics at play regarding funding allocations, student and researcher mobility, and knowledge exchanges among European universities. Within this challenging context for the governance of European higher education, this paper explores a very recent initiative in the field of higher education, the European Universities Initiative (EUI) alliances. The EUI is characterised by a hybrid type of university collaboration based on transnational alliances linking education, research, and innovation. Using the lenses of differentiated integration, the paper discusses whether the EUI alliances can lead to a trajectory of “integration without supranationalisation” with (trans) national institutions as key actors driving the alliances.",University College London,,,,,,,,University College London,,Marina Cino Pagliarello,,,,,,,,Marina Cino Pagliarello,,European Union,Governance,Integration,Differentiation,Higher Education,,,,Rethinking integration in Higher education: the (differentiated) governance of the European Universities Initiative (EUI),https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64195&EventID=185
0,"Retirement migration refers to the movement of elderly people to a different region or country for lifestyle motivations. Retirement migrants may enjoy the benefits of moving to a region/country where prices are cheaper, but their migration is not mainly driven for economic reasons but rather, to the search for better climate, amenities or social life. Previous studies on EU retirement migration show that elderly Europeans move from Northern and Central Europe to Southern countries, clustering in certain spots in the destination areas and being little or no integrated at all with the local institutions and population. I.e. retirement migrants frequently cannot speak the language of the destination country, are not aware of national regulations and institutions, and their social relations tend to include mostly members of their same country. Research carried out in Spain demonstrated that local populations do not resent (too much) this apparent isolation of retirement migrants, welcoming instead their presence as a source of jobs and money. However, this win-win equilibrium was impossible since the Covid19 crisis began. Suddenly, the isolation of retirement migrants made them unable to understand national, regional and local Covid regulations; their needs could not be meet by means of their usual self-help networks, and the local social services were overwhelmed with demands. In this paper we make use of 40 qualitative interviews with social workers, retirement migrants, and local actors related to retirement migration to describe and analyze how the pandemic impacted the lives of retirement migrants in Spain, and what strategies they developed to get ahead. Interviews took place in five Spanish “destination spots” for retirement migration.

0,"Driven by a commitment to making energy systems more just, energy justice scholars strive towards understanding what is (un)just. To do so, several approaches have been formulated, including the often-used tenet-based approach to energy justice. This approach categorises phenomena, such as claims of (in)justice or energy policies, into different tenets (i.e.  distributive, procedural, recognition, or restorative justice). Such categorisation could have a descriptive purpose in order to gain insight in the reasons behind energy conflicts, or a normative purpose to evaluate policy processes and outcomes in terms of justice, often leading to policy recommendations. However, making just energy policies ticks the boxes of a wicked problem; i.e. many stakeholders with different worldviews and interests are involved, giving shape to a complex network of bodies of knowledge, values, and principles. The tenet-based approach faces two limitations in these wicked contexts. First, it fails to explain why different stakeholders often articulate conflicting claims of (in)justice leading to contestation and, second, when conflicting claims are articulated, the question of which claim is more legitimate remains unanswered, leading to uncertainty about what just policy decisions are. 
This paper aims to add normative rigour to the energy justice scholarship, by adding the notion of normative uncertainties as situations in which there are competing normative claims. In so doing, it identifies and disentangles the normative assumptions that inevitably underlie claims of justice. To do so, this study investigates which types of normative uncertainties underlie claims of (in)justice. This has been illustrated by using the Flemish solar panel controversy case, which is a critical case helping us to explicate the descriptive and normative challenges of the tenet-based framework. In so doing, the voiced claims of (in)justice and their reasons were scrutinised for their normative assumptions. Five categories of normative assumptions in articulating energy (in)justices were found, namely assumptions regarding (1) knowledge, (2) the actors to whom principles of justice apply, (3) the time-frame, (4) the scope of justice and (5) the principles of justice. The choices made regarding these dimensions are inherently normative, and they affect what is considered (un)just. The results are presented in the form of a novel energy justice framework that can identify the normative uncertainties that underlie claims of (in)justice. 
Reviewing normative assumptions can lead to a better understanding of conflicting claims of justice amongst stakeholders. After all, if people adopt different normative premises, different conclusions about what is (un)just might be drawn, leading to stakeholders contesting each other’s claims of (in)justice. Furthermore, it helps to narrow down the big question “Which justice claims are legitimate?” to “Which normative assumptions are more legitimate?”. Unwrapping this question does not provide a final answer to the moral legitimacy question, but it helps to understand what it is exactly that requires legitimization. This will make the normative dimensions of wicked energy problems more tangible to deliberate, which is the first step towards addressing the legitimacy of claims and subsequently to making justified policy decisions.",Delft University of Technology,,,,,,,,Delft University of Technology,,Nynke van Uffelen,,,,,,,,Nynke van Uffelen,,Energy Policy,Policy-Making,Transitional justice,,,,,,Revisiting energy justice: from wicked problems to normative uncertainties,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65046&EventID=185
0,"The paper offers greater scrutiny for and elucidates the conceptual and empirical ambiguity, which makes France too frequently appear as both a promoter of Europeanisation of defence and security and a loyal protagonist of independent state action. It is argued that the debate about the French-driven political integration of defence policy is generally a faux débat, insofar as it does not provide grounds for empirically sound inference. The paper underscores two significant reasons for that. First, onto the contemporary perception of Europeanisation has been too easily projected France’s historical position with regard to political integration. As the notion of strategic autonomy is context-dependent and therefore shifts across time, France’s past political vision of Europe as a defence actor needs not translating into the country’s effort to upload its strategic culture to the European level during the contemporary period, particularly as regards the most recent advances in the Common Security and Defence Policy. Secondly – and specifically –, the contemporary political dimension of integration lags behind the economic one and is significant to the extent that French defence industry interests become those of the country’s political elites. The focus on these issues allows for more adequate inferences about the present but also the future of the European Union's defence policy.",General Jonas Žemaitis Military Academy of Lithuania,,,,,,,,General Jonas Žemaitis Military Academy of Lithuania,,Ringailė Kuokštytė,,,,,,,,Ringailė Kuokštytė,,European Union,Integration,Security,,,,,,Revisiting France’s Commitment to Defence Integration: A Case of Political Functionalism,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65767&EventID=185

Yet, notwithstanding such concerns, judicial review of allocative decision-making has become a relatively common phenomenon in recent decades. In light of this development, this paper seeks to reassess the arguments that the judiciary is lacking in institutional and constitutional competence in this field.

0,"The definition of far-right parties and movements has generated a fruitful debate in political science. Are modern far-right organisations populist, nationalist, or both? If these parties can be considered both populist and nationalist, what is their ultimate defining characteristic? The political science literature has explored these questions, questioning the centrality of the concept of populism in analyses of the far-right phenomenon (Mudde 2007, 26; Rydgren 2017). In particular, scholars from Discourse theory, such as Benjamin De Cleen and Yannis Stavrakakis (2017), have sought to construct a clear conceptual distinction between populist discourses, on the one hand, and nationalist discourses, on the other (Brubaker 2020; De Cleen and Stavrakakis 2020). According to these authors, the confusion between these two notions would lead to the reification of the link between populism and the far-right (Stavrakakis et al. 2017). The work of B. De Cleen and Y. Stavrakakis, which postulates the existence of an empirical and analytical distinction between these two concepts, has been reinforced by research on transnational populism (Moffitt 2017; De Cleen et al. 2020), and has been relayed by empirical studies aiming to demonstrate the accuracy of this discrimination (Breeze 2019; Katsambekis and Stavrakakis 2017; De Cleen 2016; Stavrakakis et al. 2017).

This paper aims to contribute to this literature trying to identify the link between nationalism and populism by mobilising the gender politics of the far-right (Spierings et al., 2015; Köttig, Petö and Bitzan 2017; Dietze and Roth 2020). To this end, this research is structured in three stages. First, the paper revisits the aforementioned debates surrounding the distinction between populism and nationalism in far-right discourses. Secondly, it reviews the literature on the gender politics of the far-right, identifying four pillars of these politics: (1) recent anti-gender mobilisations (Graff and Korolczuk 2022; Kuhar and Paternotte 2018), (2) femonationalisms (Farris 2017) and homonationalisms (Puhar 2017), (3) family and sexual politics (Akkerman 2015), and (4) representative and organisational politics (Mudde 2007, 90-118; Campion 2020). Third, by mobilising the gender politics of the far right, this paper shows how, although fundamentally intertwined, nationalism and populism respond to two different logics of political identity construction. The paper concludes that, contrary to Niels Spiering's (2020) assertion, gender is neither trivial nor pivotal in the politics of the far right, as it is a nodal element of far-right ideology.",Université de Liège,,,,,,,,Université de Liège,,Archibald Gustin,,,,,,,,Archibald Gustin,,Democracy,Extremism,Gender,Nationalism,Populism,,,,Revisiting the nationalism/populism distinction : a gender approach of far-right politics,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=62426&EventID=185
0,"The question concerning the specific contribution of relational egalitarianism to a general theory of global justice remains largely unexplored, as relational egalitarian theorists have mostly focussed on spelling out the core ideal’s requirements for the domestic, political society. In this paper, I discuss one reason for explaining this research lacuna, the influential so-called scope-based argument that has been levelled against relational egalitarian theories of justice. This argument holds that, since its conception of equality stresses the existence of a specific kind of normatively significant relations as a necessary condition for its requirements to apply, the apparent lack of such relations across and beyond states’ borders positions relational egalitarians directly and exclusively within the camp of statist theories about global justice. Thus, it suggests that the value of relational equality is mostly exhausted by requirements of social justice. In contrast, I argue in this paper that the scope-based argument ought to be rejected since it misconstrues our fundamental reasons for valuing relational equality: the normative features which ground demands for egalitarian relations are not uniquely instantiated in domestic relations of democratic reciprocity, social cooperation, or coercive institutions. By tackling the premises that serve to establish the statist conclusion, I claim that a global scope represents the best interpretation of the foundation of the relational egalitarian ideal. On the basis of that, I eventually aim to demonstrate the content and value of relational equality in accounting for globalised social and economic relations, as an example for the specific contribution that relational egalitarianism has for contemporary theorising about global justice.",Central European University,,,,,,,,Central European University,,Clemens Loidl,,,,,,,,Clemens Loidl,,Globalisation,Political Theory,Social Justice,Normative Theory,,,,,Revisiting the Scope-based Argument against Relational Egalitarianism,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65820&EventID=185
0,"The revolving door, or the hiring of former public officials by organized interest, is often associated with better access to policymakers. Specifically, political connections and process-oriented knowledge, often accumulated through professional experiences in the public sector, are seen as valuable access goods. This paper provides an in-depth analysis of the relation between the revolving door and access in the context of the European Union: to what extent and under which conditions do revolving door practices facilitate access to the European Commission? The revolving door hypothesis is tested by combining two data sources: a dataset with publicly available records about the meetings between interest organisations and senior EC officials and evidence collected through the Comparative Interest Group-survey. We demonstrate that especially highly professionalized organizations, in which staff and organizational leadership dominate, benefit from the revolving. In contrast, the extent to which the membership decides on political positioning and advocacy strategies has no impact on access. These results show that revolving door practices are primarily connected with a logic of influence and therefore such practices are particularly advantageous for strongly professionalized organization. Groups driven by a logic of membership will profit much less from the revolving door when seeking access.",Universiteit Antwerpen,Universiteit Antwerpen,,,,,,,Universiteit Antwerpen,,Sharon Belli,Jan Beyers,,,,,,,Sharon Belli,,European Union,Institutions,Interest Groups,Representation,NGOs,,,,Revolving door and access to policymakers.

My study contributes to the understanding of Chinese investment in CEE by examining whether it follows a ""divide and rule"" strategy. I argue if such a strategy holds Chinese capital should increase disproportionally in CEE countries that have recently joined the EU after adjusting for the inflation that can be attributed to the economic advantages of EU membership.

0,"The paper looks at two foundational principles of international law – the right of territorial conquest and the freedom of the seas – and discusses their role in the establishment of the global order of rights to natural resources. The origins of these two principles are traced to two European colonial projects – the Spanish conquest of the Americas and the establishment of the Dutch trading empire in the East Indies. The paper analyzes how particular historical conditions of each of these colonial projects provided fertile ground for the forging of the two legal doctrines, how they justified the colonization of distant peoples and their lands and resources and with what consequences – and how they continued to facilitate the accumulation of natural resources in the long history of imperial expansion. 
The main point of the paper is to show that both of these rules of international law shaped and structured two distinct modern legal regimes of rights over natural space – territorial sovereignty and global commons – which now complement each other in the geospatial global order of rights to natural resources. The paper argues that the uncovering of the colonial origins of this order enables to identify the main dimensions of resource injustice which continues to characterize the appropriation and the use of natural resources to this day. Three main categories of resource injustice associated with this dual order of territorial sovereignty and global commons are identified: 1) the injustice of lawless capture of resources (forceful, violent, unlawful, or illegitimate establishment of property rights), 2) the injustice of distributive inequality (inequality of the distribution of opportunities, benefits, and burdens related to the use of natural resources), and 3) the injustice of corrupt rule (the use of natural resources for the exclusive benefit of the sovereign and the perpetration of an unjust rule).",Friedrich-Schiller Universität Jena,,,,,,,,Friedrich-Schiller Universität Jena,,Petra Gümplova,,,,,,,,Petra Gümplova,,Political Theory,Developing World Politics,Critical Theory,Global,International,,,,Right of Conquest and Freedom of the Seas.

0,"Immigration studies have developed typologies of welfare provision available to migrants, the most significant of which to date are Sainsbury (2012) and Pennings and Seeleib (2018). However, these studies focus on particular visas, at key points in time, rather than the full array of temporary and permanent visas and their variation over time. Further, accurately understanding the intersection of welfare-migration nexus is legally complex, requiring construction of detailed legislative and legal regimes. In the study of the welfare-immigration nexus, the devil is in the detail. In this paper, an interdisciplinary political science and legal team presents a fresh methodology to analyse welfare provision to migrants across country, visa type and where relevant, sub-national unit. Welfare studies generally must face the challenge of defining what welfare is (Ferragina and Seeleib-Kaiser 2018). This paper takes a capacious definition of welfare that includes not only cash benefits but also services and access to education for school-age migrant children. It explores this methodology through preliminary examination of three most-different welfare and immigration systems: Australia, the UK, and Italy have varied temporary migration landscapes.  Australia has the highest rates of economic-based migration of the three.  Italy has faced unique pressures with humanitarian and undocumented migration from North Africa.  The UK provides an example of a country that has moved from a closed to an open migration state, during the 1990s, and closing again with Brexit in 2020.  The welfare systems of these three countries also vary. In developing this methodology, the paper presents fresh and more accurate ways to consider the rights of those at the margin and the intertemporal dynamics in provision.",Università degli Studi di Torino,University of Sydney,University of Sydney,University of Sydney,Griffith University,,,,Università degli Studi di Torino,,Tiziana Caponio,Anna Boucher,Terry Carney,Michelle Peterie,Juliet Pietsch,,,,Tiziana Caponio,,Social Policy,Welfare State,Immigration,Comparative Perspective,Policy-Making,,,,Rights from the margins: Migrant welfare rights in comparative perspective,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63374&EventID=185
0,"Different policy instruments can serve the same policy goal, such as climate change mitigation, while serving very different individual interests. The question whether carbon should be stored primarily as a standing stock (forest sink) or in harvested wood for material use (wood sink) is a prime example of such a goal that can be pursued with different strategies. As more countries commit to achieving a net zero carbon emissions goal within the next decades, this question becomes ever more relevant. Using the case study of Swiss constituent state of Lucerne, we evaluate stakeholders’ preferences of a variety of policy instruments, promoting either forest or timber sinks. We differentiate between instruments according to the degree of government intervention: informational, cooperative, economic, and regulatory instruments. Using data from an online survey conducted in 2020 to evaluate existing instruments (e.g. information campaigns) and potential novel instruments currently used in other policy fields (e.g. direct payments to forest owners, similar to those used in agricultural policy), we provide an overview of preferred policy instruments in relation to forest and timber sinks. In the Swiss corporatist system, the stakeholders – and their preferences - can significantly influence (future) decisions on the distribution of funding and resources. Hence, we explore the discrepancy between the evaluation of individual policy instruments and support for a specific strategy (wood sink versus forest sink) in the context of a first-mover advantage and its ripple effect on subsequent policy choices.","ETH Zurich / Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow and Landscape Research WSL",,,,,,,,"ETH Zurich / Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow and Landscape Research WSL",,Tamaki Ohmura,,,,,,,,Tamaki Ohmura,,Environmental Policy,Climate Change,Policy Implementation,Policy-Making,,,,,Rippling into a forest or wood sink approach to climate change mitigation: Actor Preferences for Policy Strategies and Instruments,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63568&EventID=185
0,"The ethical considerations of research projects are integral to methodology: “method is ethics, ethics is method” (Markham). Methodology shapes the ethical questions that we must consider, which then shape methodological choices. Ethics is institutionalised in Research Ethics Committees (RECs) and Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) with the process intended as a measure to prevent ‘undue harm’ (Morrison et al). However, literature is replete with ‘horror stories’ of committee overreach, oversight, and the misapplication of ethical principles. Research on extremism and the internet is one intersection that can face a challenging ethical review process, with Morrison et al noting that such research is often considered ‘inherently high risk’ even when it does not need to be. Traditional research ethics and institutional processes have been more broadly critiqued for not keeping up with the evolving risk landscape and ethical dilemmas facing researchers. For researchers of extremism, the power balance can be upended with researchers rendered vulnerable in front of the far right's ‘gaze’ (Massanari).

The advent of the internet and neoliberal developments in academia such as ‘publish or perish’ and success measured on output and impact have reshaped the landscape of potential threats and the risks researchers are exposed to. Academics are increasingly understood to be at risk of networked harassment, watchlists, vicarious trauma, and institutional critique, with the far-right training its ‘gaze’ on critical research in particular (Massanari). These developments have coincided with an explosion in the volume of scholarship on the far right.

Drawing from 21 interviews with researchers of the far right, this paper situates lived experience within literature on neoliberal academia and the libertarian internet to critically analyse the environment in which we operate and its impact on how we research. In particular, the paper focuses on how institutional ethics processes have responded to developments in methodology, research environments, and the risk environment. The findings indicate that risk and harm are embedded in the practice of such research. Exacerbating this, institutional ethics processes are experienced as incompatible with supporting research and researchers, perceived to lack fundamental knowledge, and maintaining an overwhelming focus on responsibilising risk and liability. Rather than developing with innovative research, respondents found that ethics committees judged their projects based on traditional research ethics and mediatised understandings of the far right and the internet. This paper argues that institutional ethics review processes are an insufficient way to assess and manage risk due to the focus on liability, and emphasis on the researcher as expert. This has significant ramifications for institutional and individual protection of researchers, especially when confronting broader trends of academic microcelebrity.

0,"The literature on informalization usually distinguishes between ‘hard’ (legally binding) and ‘soft’ (non-legally binding) rules. This paper suggests a different distinction: between primary rules (parliamentary law) on the one hand, and secondary rules (delegated legislation) and tertiary rules (non-legally binding rules) on the other. Both primary and secondary rules are legally binding, and, therefore, hard law. But secondary rules have in common with tertiary rules that they are promulgated by the executive instead of the legislator and that procedural and publication requirements are not always regulated (Baldwin 2005). The legal implications of using secondary or tertiary rules as regards democracy and rule of law are, therefore, similar.  Migration law is part of administrative law. In administrative law, delegation of rulemaking power from the legislator to the executive is common. However, migration law also suffers from ‘migration exceptionalism’, i.e. the idea that migration law is so different from the rest of the regulatory state, that general constitutional and administrative law doctrines do not apply (Rubenstein and Gulasekaram 2017). A lack of constraints stemming from these fields of law increases the risk of arbitrary power, i.e. power that is uncontrolled, unpredictable or unrespectful (Krygier). This paper discusses the results of an empirical case study into rulemaking in the Netherlands as regards sanctions for asylum seekers who live in reception centres. It will examine the relation between primary, secondary and tertiary rules on this issue, map the constraints for the executive stemming from the primary rules and general constitutional and administrative law and analyse to what extent these constraints are complied with. This paper concludes that there is not enough protection against the risk of arbitrary rulemaking power on this particular issue. The results of this case study support the more general hypothesis that the risk of arbitrary rulemaking power in migration governance is too high, seen from the perspective of the rule of law and freedom as non-domination. It shows the need to also pay attention to formal rulemaking practises, as they might have similar implications as informal ones.",Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam,,,,,,,,Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam,,Lieneke Slingenberg,,,,,,,,Lieneke Slingenberg,,Migration,Public Administration,Regulation,Social Policy,Immigration,Asylum,State Power,,Risk of arbitrariness?

0,"As demonstrated by the COVID-19 pandemic, many political decisions involve a high level of uncertainty. Policy outcomes are subject to a variety of factors that lie beyond the scope of influence and cognition of the decision-makers and are thus – at least from the point of view of the politician – subject to chance. However, when evaluating the past performance of politicians, several studies suggest that voters tend to focus on policy outcomes rather than on the political decisions and the circumstances under which they were taken, leading to less than optimal voting decisions. In this study, we examine this so-called outcome bias and its effect on the delegation process. In an online experiment, subjects assigned the role of a politician decide how much to invest in a risky policy, whereas subjects assigned the role of a voter decide whether to re-elect the politicians based on the politicians’ decision and the outcome. The treatments, which vary the potential reward and risk of the policy as well as information about the outcome of the risk decision, allow us to assess whether risk preferences and outcome bias affect voters’ decisions and whether politicians are responsive to voters’ risk preferences and biases. We find evidence that politicians adapt to the assumed risk preferences of the voters and that voters are significantly more likely to elect politicians who advocate for policies that are closer to the voters’ risk preferences. Our results provide (weak) support for the existence of an outcome bias among voters. Furthermore, we find a strong incumbency effect, with voters being more likely to re-elect incumbents even if they are farther away from their own risk preferences than potential other candidates.","Institute for Advanced Studies, Vienna",University of Vienna,Carl Von Ossietzky Universität Oldenburg,,,,,,"Institute for Advanced Studies, Vienna",,Monika Mühlböck,Manuel Schwaninger,Jan Sauermann,,,,,,Monika Mühlböck,,Political Psychology,Representation,Voting,Experimental Design,,,,,Risk Preferences and Outcome Bias in the Delegation Process,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64259&EventID=185
0,"Automated decision-making processes and artificial intelligence (AI) are becoming increasingly prevalent across all sectors of society. However, such applications are also accompanied by significant risks, which have prompted regulatory responses. One of the most significant regulatory efforts in this domain is the so-called AI Act proposed by the European Commission in 2021.  The Act itself adopts a risk-based approach, where the suggested regulatory framework foresees three categories of AI practices structured along their envisaged degree of risk: 
First, most risky practices are prohibited.  Those include procedures such as social scoring,  certain detrimental nudging tactics , or specific types of remote biometrical identification by law enforcement.  The next category covers so-called high-risk AI.  This includes both, the use of AI in types of products which EU law already requires to undergo third-party conformity assessment;  as well as certain areas of application which are deemed high risk, such as biometric identification, critical infrastructure, education, etc.  Such high-risk AI applications then need to undergo themselves conformity assessment procedures, similarly to the one for product safety as mentioned above. Lastly, all applications that do not fall within the categories just described are deemed limited or minimal risk. There are no specific requirements linked to their development or application other than transparency obligations in some cases.  
Despite being the first comprehensive attempt to regulate AI technology, the proposed AI Act and public regulation in the area more generally faces many challenges. One major constraint concerns the evolving nature of the technologies involved, where sufficient understanding is often limited to developers and professional users. As a result, for the regulation of risks created by these complex technologies the work of those (usually private) actors configuring the technical details is highly relevant. Technical standards produced by private actors are therefore crucial as they specify the parameters within which new technologies operate.

Our paper analyses the underlying theoretical understanding of risk in the regulatory context just outlined. Two aspects are of central importance for this analysis: 

1. The role of risk as a factor for regulation regarding a technology that is under constant development with unknown outcomes; and 
2. Risk as defined not only by public regulators but also by private actors involved in the development and application of risk creating activities. 

In our analysis we adopt a genealogical approach to provide a critical perspective of risk as adopted in the AI Act. Notions such as risk are not coherent or have a transparent meaning.

0,"Not only is the public use of deliberative minipublics on the rise around the globe, some have claimed that this is accompanied by increasing consequentiality (OECD Report, 2020). But the issue of minipublic consequentiality is contested (Achen 2022) and under-researched. A few pioneering studies have addressed this issue, especially Font et al. (2016) who found that minipublic recommendations are “cherry-picked”, but this finding is limited to the Spanish context. Similarly, Smith et al. (2015) found out of the Participedia database that the more deliberative minipublics are, the less policy effects they create; again this result is based on a limited number of crowd-sourced cases. The OECD (2020) has compiled an extensive database on deliberative minipublics, but despite an update in 2022 information on the uptake of minipublic recommendations is limited - especially with regard to antecedents of mini-public success or failure - and fairly scattered across different contexts. In this paper we introduce a new dataset based on the Participedia platform, enhanced by an “observer survey” complementing missing cases and updating missing information. The databank comprises over 150 minipublic cases conducted at the national and regional level in Great Britain, Germany, France, Ireland, Italy, Denmark and Finland as well as the European level in the period from 2000-2021. By focusing on a wide-range of potential antecedents of minipublic uptake, ranging from process design (e.g. initiative, purpose, size, composition), issue type (complexity and salience), political support (especially alignment of recommendations with preferences of political elites), and characteristics of the country context (e.g. open vs closed political systems), the dataset provides a new springboard for exploring the antecedents of minipublic uptake. We will provide first results exploring whether there is a “technocratic” or “democratic” road to minipublic success, i.e. whether minipublic uptake – defined as full, partial or no implementation of minpublic recommendations - only happens when minipublics are organized top-down, are designed for policy appraisal and do not contest the preferences of political elites (“technocratic” road) or whether uptake also happens when some procedural features are more democratic (bottom-up organization, allowance for policy development and non-alignment with elite preferences).",Universität Stuttgart,Universität Stuttgart,,,,,,,Universität Stuttgart,,Seraphine Arnold,André Bächtiger,,,,,,,Seraphine Arnold,,Democracy,Policy Implementation,Empirical,,,,,,Roads to minipublic success: Exploring “technocratic” and “democratic” pathways to uptake based on a new dataset of deliberative minipublics,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=62769&EventID=185
0,"Co-management is increasingly seen as the way forward especially, when it comes to management of urban commons. Co-management entails not just sharing of power between government and users but includes exchange of information, allocation of resources and numerous other forms of coupling including changes in regulations and development of common goal among actors. In this paper, we identify and analyse how authority, information and resources (financial and human) influence collaboration between diverse actors engaged in lake management in areas under urban transformation. Drawing from cases located in Greater Bengaluru Metropolitan Region (GBMR), India, we highlight that collaboration mainly between state and non-state actors can range from state sponsorship  to bottom-up citizen collective movement with minimal government involvement. To understand how this process unravels in the face of urban transformations, we analyse five lakes, within a single watershed along a rural-urban gradient GBMR. Our analysis suggests that actors tend to work within their administrative boundaries in terms of collaborations between state and non-state actors, both in urban and rural contexts. This we suppose is mainly to overcome incapacities as is seen in our urban case (resources) and rural case (information), sometimes in the presence of third-sector organisations who facilitate collaborations. Our research highlights how collaborations between actors vary across the rural-urban gradient, based on actor legitimacy, shared understanding and access to resources, and how these interconnections are shaped by community dependence on these commons along a rural-urban gradient.",University of Kassel,University of Kassel,,,,,,,University of Kassel,,Arvind Lakshmisha,Andreas Thiel,,,,,,,Arvind Lakshmisha,,Asia,Development,Governance,India,Local Government,Public Policy,Coalition,Decision Making,"Role of Authority, Information and Resources in Co-management of lakes in areas under urban transformation: Cases from Greater Bengaluru Metropolitan Region (GBMR), India",https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65389&EventID=185
0,"It is empirically well established that modern authoritarian regimes cannot survive by giving material benefits to the elite of the ruling circle and repressing dissidents alone; they also need to develop ""legitimation strategies,"" discourses, and policies that show their competence to rule to the broader public. The empirical literature provides strong evidence for the causal effects of economic and institutional strategies authoritarian regimes use to increase their legitimacy. However, the causal effect of ""ideological legitimation"", a set of ideas political elites use to justify their rule, on authoritarian regimes remains ambiguous in the literature. Specifically, the literature only focuses on closed authoritarian regimes with no multiparty competition when analysing the impact of regime ideology on authoritarian stability. Even in those examinations, the literature does not consider the issue of endogeneity and reverse causality between authoritarian stability and the development of an ideological narrative. Recognizing the causal effect of ideological legitimation on authoritarian regimes as an empirical gap, I try to understand whether regimes that use ideological legitimation strategies to higher degrees are more likely to survive. In the analysis, I combine data from regime legitimation strategies data of Varieties of Democracy Institute with original coding of authoritarian regime country-years (1991-2020). To test the proposed relationship, I use large-n macro-level comparison and fit a multivariate random-effects logistic regression model to account for country-level heterogeneity in the data. Furthermore, recognizing the endogenous nature of ideological legitimation to authoritarian stability, I use instrumental variable estimation techniques to ""randomize"" the degree of ideology. Being inspired by previous studies that show a relationship between colonial history and ""exclusionary ideologies"", I use the length of colonial or patrimonial rule in a country to instrument for the degree of ideological legitimation. My findings suggest that while the degree of ideological legitimation has a significant, positive effect on authoritarian stability, this effect is smaller when instrumental variable techniques are used. Overall, my study consolidates the role of ideology on authoritarian regimes' stability while also emphasizing that its effect should not be overestimated. These findings imply that the ideological claims of authoritarian regimes should not be treated as cheap talk, and they should be taken seriously.

0,"Paper proposal for consideration for Panel 2: Political Actors’ Behaviour in Sub-National Politics.

One of the established findings in the literature is that elected representatives have different role perceptions and they may privilege representing their constituents/voters over representing their party, or vice versa. What is less known is which factors are driving representatives to lean towards their voters or to their party. We develop two sets of hypotheses. First, representatives who have strong subnational attachments and who come from a rural or peripheral jurisdiction are more likely to find it important to represent their constituents. Second, we theorize that the extent to which elected representatives are inclined to follow their voters instead of their party depends on the identarian and distributional consequences a policy or decision has on the constituency. Representatives will be more in line with their constituents when a policy concerns the local identity or welfare of their jurisdiction and when the benefits of a policy are likely to be shared by the whole nation while the costs are likely to be imposed on the jurisdiction of the representative.

These hypotheses are tested through a survey experiment fielded to around 2,000 elected municipal and county representatives in Norway in February 2022. Respondents were asked to indicate their support for each policy in hypothetical scenarios whereby representatives randomly received one of the two treatments: their political party is against this policy but their constituents support it, or vice-versa. This question and the treatment were repeated for six policies, all of which concerned the building of a new infrastructure that vary on their identarian and distributional consequences for a jurisdiction: building of a new road, a new hospital, a new nursing home, a new museum about the history of their municipality/region, a new wind park, and a new waste recycling plant.

The results support our hypotheses: representatives –and especially those with strong subnational attachments—are more inclined to deviate from their party when it concerns an infrastructure that concern the identity or welfare of the subnational jurisdiction (museum, hospital and nursing home). In addition, representatives –and especially those from rural and peripheral jurisdictions—are more inclined to deviate from their party when the costs are largely borne by the subnational jurisdiction (road, wind park, waste recycling plant). These findings are important because they reveal that role perceptions of representatives change depending on the decision/policy at hand as well as on the characteristics of the jurisdiction of a representative.",Universitetet i Bergen,Universitetet i Bergen,,,,,,,Universitetet i Bergen,,Berkay Alica,Arjan H.

0,"Is the current democratic slump connected to the predicaments of ethnic minority groups and identity conflicts? Despite efforts by previous literatures, we still lack an assessment of the effect of ethnic inequalities on regime transformations away from democracy. The proposed paper represents a first step of a doctoral project, which will address this gap through a nested analysis, integrating quantitative and qualitative techniques to study the effect of economic, political and social inequalities between ethnic majority and minority groups on autocratization episodes after the Cold War. Overall, I hypothesize that these structural factors can boost the actions of authoritarian entrepreneurs, with detrimental consequences for democracy.
After the end of the ‘democratic optimism’ of the 1990s and a new ‘pessimism’ in the 2010s, only recently have experts on regime developments proposed new frameworks to scrutinize democratization ‘in reverse’. These efforts are increasing, but still at the beginning: autocratization and its causes are not properly addressed. The paper first contributes to redefine autocratization on the Sartorian ladder of abstraction, as an umbrella term of different phenomena (e.g., decline of democratic quality or democratic backsliding, and democratic breakdown). Also, it will demonstrate that many currently autocratizing countries (such as India, Turkey, Serbia, Benin, Niger, the US, Israel, or Brazil) resemble ethnically divided societies – where ethnic, national, regional, religious, linguistic identities are politically salient. This does not amount to saying that in these contexts autocratization is always connected to ethnicity or identity issues. Yet, the analysis will focus on economic, political, and social inequalities – rather than simple cleavages – between ethnic groups.
Practically, after the conceptual part, the paper will consist of some empirical tests of the hypothesis that, increasing ethnic inequalities in different spheres of the societies, a country will be more likely to autocratize. Accordingly, with polarization between or exclusion of ethnic groups (social ethnic inequalities), majoritarian institutions where the ‘ethnic’ winner can take it all through elections (political ethnic inequalities), and economic inequalities between ethnic majority and minorities (economic ethnic inequalities), would-be authoritarian entrepreneurs may find fertile soil for dismantling democracy, winning elections and then restricting liberal safeguards to the benefit of their associates. The global analysis will be based on multinomial logistic models for analyzing regime transitions (such as from liberal to electoral democracy, from electoral democracy to electoral autocracy, etc.) or other episodes of autocratization, and OLS models to scrutinize the decay of democratic quality across regime-types. It will specifically test these sets of explanations related to ethnic inequalities for different types of autocratization. The paper concludes presenting the findings of the analysis and the next steps of the doctoral research, in particular on the application of these results in a case-study-based analysis of some path-way examples of autocratization episodes related to ethnic inequality.",Université Libre de Bruxelles,,,,,,,,Université Libre de Bruxelles,,Guido Panzano,,,,,,,,Guido Panzano,,Comparative Politics,Democratisation,Ethnic Conflict,National Identity,Nationalism,Identity,Mixed Methods,Political Regime,Roots of Ethnic Authoritarianism: Autocratization and Ethnic Inequalities in the Contemporary World,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64207&EventID=185

0,"Prof. dr. Maarten Hajer  Maarten is distinguished professor Urban Futures and Director of the Urban Futures Studio of Utrecht University. He will reflect upon the paper “Places of Hope: how a heterotopic intervention made the future present” that Wytske Versteeg, Jesse Hoffman and himself wrote together. High modernist policy making seems unable to respond adequately to the mounting climate disruption, which has led to calls for a reimagination of democratic institutions (Dryzek & Pickering 2019; Mert 2019; Tremmel 2019; cf Hajer & Versteeg 2019). The paper discusses a practical example of reimagining, with which all three authors were closely involved: the Dutch transdisciplinary intervention Places of Hope. Places of Hope was an exhibition focused on the spatial future of the Netherlands, commissioned by the Dutch government. In an address the Minister for the Interior stated: By giving the commission for this exhibition (...) the national government leaves its traditional role and consciously searches for other actors with which to share knowledge and solutions. Places of Hope consisted of a parade, an exhibition, a series of events and collaborative sessions for stakeholders in a depoliticized setting, intended to explore ways to give citizens a renewed 'appetite for the future'. It was open from April until November 2018 and attracted 12.646 officially registered visitors. Post hoc evaluations show that the manifestation had a lasting positive impact on the majority of its visitors, who ranged from vulnerable citizens to high-level policymakers.

The paper reflects on the evaluations the authors received and seeks to theorize the role of exhibitions like Places of Hope and speculate on its future potential. According to Raymond Williams (1989: 4), ‘[t]he making of a society is a finding of common meanings and directions, and its growth is an active debate and amendment under the pressures of experience, contact and discovery, writing themselves into the land.’ A society leaning too much on what is already known runs the risk of losing its ability to adapt to new challenges, whereas a failure to connect new meanings with already existing structures might critically damage the ability to perceive, let alone work towards, a common good.

The authors argue that the imaginative and relational quality of transdisciplinary interventions such as Places of Hope can play a crucial role in this regard. Ideally, they act as heterotopias (Foucault 1967), existing in close connection to policy circles yet providing a sheltered space within which relations that are typically taken for granted can be suspended and reinvented. This allows for temporary changes in social roles and for a postponement of usually entrenched binaries such as ideal/real, future/past, nature/culture, public/private and body/mind, as we will show building on visitors' reactions to Places of Hope. Interventions such as PoH thus allow space for political experimentation and engagement with a joint future which cannot be found in routine forms of citizen participation or in the often cognitively oriented practices of the conventional science-policy interface of environmental politics.",University of Utrecht,,,,,,,,University of Utrecht,,Maarten Hajer,,,,,,,,Maarten Hajer,,Civil Society,Conflict,Political Theory,,,,,,Roundtable discussion based on Places of Hope: how a heterotopic intervention made the future present,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65253&EventID=185

0,"The paper discusses experiences and prospects of using the policy lab approach to teach the basics of public policy design to students majoring in disciplines different from political sciences.
The rationale for the course is that modern policy problems are complex (Head, 2019). To address them effectively requires the collaboration of different stakeholders across the sectors. Thus, helping business students understand how policy design works could build future cross-sectoral cooperation and better public policies.
The practical challenge of the course was to find a formula that (a) allows presenting basic policy design concepts, (b) provides the possibility to demonstrate the practical value of the subject matter, and (c) provides engagement and collaboration in the digital environment. 
We have chosen a policy lab formula. Policy labs are broadly defined as teams and organizations set up for innovative activities of public policymaking. Their practice has been emerging in recent years (Wellstead, Gofen, & Carter, 2021). At their core, stakeholders engage in the collaborative design of policy solutions. 
The paper presents the experimental use of policy lab formula in five courses with 143 business and management majors students throughout the semester. Students worked in 41 teams, drafting policy solutions to food waste problems in the Warsaw metropolis.
In the introduction to the paper, we outline the policy lab approach in more detail, explaining how an earlier behaviorally-informed design framework (Olejniczak, Śliwowski, & Leeuw, 2020) was simplified and adapted to the course requirements.
At the core of the paper, we discuss the results of our experimental course presented around three major themes and backed up with data collected from course participants during the semester. 
(1) Participants' perception of the process. The clarity and user-friendliness of the process are discussed based on survey results before-after the course, the facilitator's observations during the course, and exit interviews with students about the positives and negatives of the lab experience. 
(2) Quality of outputs generated in the lab. This issue covers the comparative assessment of design solutions developed by the teams of students. The quality of ideas was graded by the instructor and evaluated by practitioners from Warsaw City Hall.  
(3) Knowledge gains. This point covers reflection on the knowledge gained by students and their takeaways beyond the course. It is discussed based on students' test results, self-assessments, and their general reflection on the utility of the lab experience for a future career. 
In the conclusions we sum up our assessment of the value of the policy lab formula for the teaching public policy. Furthermore, we put forward three broader takeaways coming from this individual practice. These are (i) ideas for implementing experiential learning in a digital environment, (ii) lessons on keeping the engagement in the design process throughout the semester, and (iii) lessons on improving the user-friendliness of policy design concepts and procedures to the general public.

0,"In recent years, a number of studies have diagnosed a growing resentment of rural residents towards political elites. Ruralites seem to increasingly lose trust in the way the political system works, culminating in a feeling of being ‘left behind’ by the political establishment. However, in most democracies around the world, citizens have to deal with political institutions located at several different levels of government. In this regard, it has been well documented that political institutions at lower tiers elicit higher levels of political trust than institutions on the upper tiers of a country’s political system. Drawing on this observation, this paper argues that the ‘crisis of trust’ in rural areas is not to be understood as a loss of trust in the political system per se, but rather as an increase in skepticism directed at national level institutions specifically. Using original survey data from Germany, multilevel regression models show that increasing levels of rural resentment are strongly correlated with lower trust in the national parliament, but higher trust in political institutions at the local level. This result carries important implications for fostering political trust in ‘left behind’ rural communities. Besides place-sensitive economic policies, continuing to devolve political authority to local institutions might present a viable solution to counteract widespread feelings of rural neglect.",University of Zurich,,,,,,,,University of Zurich,,Sven Hegewald,,,,,,,,Sven Hegewald,,Local Government,Regionalism,Public Opinion,Survey Research,,,,,Rural resentment and political trust in local and national institutions,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63989&EventID=185
0,"This paper will draw on the sustainability transitions literature to analyse how Russia is depicted as a factor influencing the energy transition of small Nordic European countries – Estonia, Finland and Norway – with differing energy profiles and relationship with Russia. The aims are (1) to conceptualise and operationalise landscape more closely in sustainability transitions research, (2) to explore how global energy super-power Russia can form a landscape pressure for smaller countries in the interface of energy and security, and (3) how this pressure interlinks with the decarbonisation of the energy system.

Landscape is a central concept in sustainability transition studies, by being one of the three core elements of the multi-level perspective. It is the selection environment for niches and socio-technical regimes, determining the conditions for their operation (Berkhout et al., 2009). Landscape can be understood in a metaphorical sense, as something that sustains us and we are part of, for example as a society, and in a literal sense, such as geography and economics (Rip and Kemp, 1998). It is often described as a slow-moving and a relatively stable heterogenous grouping of things, such as environmental problems, demographical trends, political ideologies and macro-economic patterns, while it can also comprise rapid shocks, such as wars and pandemics (Kanda and Kivimaa, 2020). It has been criticised as difficult to operationalise (Rock et al., 2009). Smith et al. (2010) have described landscapes as “spatially distributed across policy jurisdictions at different scales”, while “the boundaries of a socio-technical regime are not necessarily identical with those of a geographical landscape”. Thus, the landscape for low-carbon energy transitions looks different from the perspective of different countries. 

Based on literature review, we will create a framework to explore Russia as a landscape factor. Due to this context, we omit natural events without direct human intervention as an element. Instead, we explore (a) concrete developments based on the performance of vast groups of actors, i.e., social and institutional constructions, (b) geographical location and overall scale, i.e., the spatial element, and (c) perceptions of actors regarding these developments and the value and importance assigned to these pressures, i.e., the actor element.

The research method is an analysis of 46 interviews of expert actors in energy and security domains of the three countries, and how they construct Russia as a landscape pressure in relation to zero-carbon energy transitions. We compare both the three case countries and the perceptions of energy and security experts. Russia is portrayed as a geopolitical entity with large influence on other states, and hence a landscape pressure. Tentative insights indicate that despite all three countries sharing a border with Russia, it is depicted differently as a direct security threat involving caution (Estonia, and security actors more generally), or a desecuritised energy market actor (Finland, and many energy sector actors). Norway faces less direct landscape pressure from Russia due to its significant energy resources.",University of Sussex,Tampere University,,,,,,,University of Sussex,,Paula Kivimaa,Marja Helena Sivonen,,,,,,,Paula Kivimaa,,Political Economy,Security,Climate Change,Energy,,,,,Russia as a landscape factor in the energy transition of small European countries,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64734&EventID=185
0,"When, why, and how does Islamization of secular institutions take place? How do Islamist political elites justify the Islamization of the existing formal secular institutions? To answer these questions, this study examines Islamization process in Turkey, a Muslim-majority country in the global south with a secular political system. The study utilizes data derived from parliamentary discussions, official statements, and several interviews to advance the following arguments: Turkish Islamization constitutes an intriguing case of incremental, gradual Islamization, which involves multiple stages, levels, forms, issue areas and mechanisms and processes. 1) In the first stage of incremental Islamization in a secular political system, an Islamist movement needs to control political power through electoral victory, which requires establishing a broad coalition. However, controlling electoral majority is necessary but not sufficient for the Islamization of the extant secular legal-institutional structures because several endogenous and exogenous factors might still constrain the incumbent coalition. Hence, in the second stage, two conditions should coalesce for Islamization to occur: a) pro-Islamization faction should gain the control of the ruling coalition (endogenous facilitator), b) the existing secular power centers should be eliminated or weakened to facilitate Islamization initiatives endorsed by the dominant pro-Islamic faction within the ruling party (exogenous facilitator). Even under these circumstances, instead of sacralizing the state and society in a top-down fashion using its incumbent advantage, the ruling Islamists might still prefer to build coalitions behind legal and institutional changes through both ideational (Islamic legitimacy) and material (i.e., expected utility) arguments and reasonings. The article also addresses the broader implications of the Turkish Islamization for sacralization processes in other national settings (e.g., Israel, India, Poland, and Hungary).",Middlebury College,Bilkent University,,,,,,,Bilkent University,,Sebnem Gumuscu,Zeki Sarigil,,,,,,,Zeki Sarigil,,Institutions,Islam,Religion,Southern Europe,,,,,Sacralizing the Secular: Islamization Process in Turkey,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=62498&EventID=185
0,"Population ecology and niche theory are key concepts used in current research into interest groups, used to explain the birth and death of organisations, as well as their adaptation to external challenges. A key concept used in this literature is that of a “niche” (Lowery and Gray 1996). Niches have been examined in a plethora of ways, focusing on the issues that groups focus on; their membership; strategies; and even the broader concept of identity. Yet, thus far, few studies have examined the different ways that groups can define their niches simultaneously. This exploratory paper thereby aims to explore whether – and how – new climate organisations in the Netherlands construct niches for themselves. Climate organisations provide a useful case study as there has been a sharp increase in the number of new climate organisations over the past years, thereby increasing the potential resource pressure on groups. The empirical section draws on document analysis and interview data from Dutch climate organisations founded in the past 5 years to assess the various ways in which groups construct niches and deal with organisational challenges.

0,"Recent research has challenged the traditional approach to party competition that parties campaign on their own issues and downplay the issues owned by their opponents. Empirical studies show that rather than talking past each other parties often trespass on their opponents’ issues. Real-world events impact political agenda putting into public spotlight issues that parties would prefer to neglect forcing them to engage in issue dialogue. A growing number of researchers argue that parties use framing as a complementary strategy that facilitates issue dialogue. Framing allows parties to distinguish themselves through the way they talk about the issue at stake. That is, how parties define the issue, what justification or what result of the proposed policy solution do they promote. In combination with a selective issue emphasis choice parties face a choice of a framing strategy, as they decide whether they should reframe the issue owned by their opponent or adopt the opponent’s frames. As social media become an important campaign communication channel, new challenges emerge in party competition. Parties are increasingly confronted with a need to react to their opponents and the public in a high-paced environment that allows for engagement.  Thus, issue selection and framing choice happen in a more dynamic setting than the traditional campaign communication channels, such as manifestos or even press releases that allow more time to craft a message. My paper explores the strategies on the issue and framing dimension on social media and in traditional campaign communication channels in federal election campaigns in the federal elections in Germany (2009-2021). I investigate the changes in issue and framing dynamics over time, accounting for the exogenous shocks, party-specific factors, and the election context.

In this debate sanctuary figures as a place where people are at least temporarily safe from deportation. Next to churches, municipalities have played a prominent role in resisting state attempts to deport people whom they regard as “well-integrated” into the local community. Understood in this way, a sanctuary is local site of resistance and a temporary arrangement. For certain migrants, however, stronger claims have been made that they should enjoy a legal status that makes them non-deportable. There are two distinct normative grounds for non-deportability. One is that people should generally not be expelled from places that have become their homes; the other one is that states should not have the power to expel their citizens.

For example, the coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19 pandemic), which began in spring 2020, is a crisis that brought numerous disruptions of normality, including drastic policies like school closures which were greatly debated in stories and narratives by many policy actors.
In March 2020, New York City (NYC) became an early epicenter of the pandemic in the US, with a case fatality rate of over 9% (Thompson et al. 2020). NYC’s public school system is the largest in the US. The shutdowns (State of New York 2020) affected over 1.1 million students (The New York Times 2020) and caused an enormous breakdown in the preexisting order.
With great efforts regarding safety regulations, schools were reopened in September, only to be shut down a second time shortly after in November 2020 (The New York Times 2020). Both shutdowns came along with narratives by policy actors against and in favor of school closures. These narratives were based on (competing) scientific evidence on both sides, likewise arguing with the safety of students, teachers, parents, and the overall population.
Against this backdrop, the following thesis analyzes how scientific evidence was used in the narratives surrounding the school shutdowns in NYC. As a relatively new and emerging approach in policy-based scholarship (Stauffer and Kuenzler (2021) in Special Issue of European Policy Analysis), the Narrative Policy Framework (NPF) is an ideal tool to analyze this research question. Narrative policy scholars that draw on Positivism and Postpositivism claim: It is through narratives that debates about policies are held (Shanahan et al. 2017, 173). Thus, to fully understand the policy process, the role of narratives must be studied.

Following the two separate school shutdowns, two time periods are studied and compared: First, from the end of January 2020, when China announced the closing of their schools to the first school shutdown in NYC on March 16, and second, from September 21, when schools were reopened in NYC to the second shutdown, November 19.
The examination of this case study is a non-experimental research design. Policy narratives are constructed and circulated by several policy actors (Jones, Shanahan, and McBeth 2014, 15). This study examines data from the Mayor, NY State Governor, the NYC Council Speaker, teachers’ organizations, the health care workers’ union, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), NYC Public Schools, and NYC Parents Union. Furthermore, narrative data can be sourced from any communication such as text, video, or symbols. For this case, study data are generated through content analysis of the communication involved in the policy debate. Relevant narratives in text form are analyzed, which were used in press briefings and conferences, media interviews, and messages from the social media platform Twitter.
The analysis focuses on what narratives were told for each shutdown and what differences can be identified with particular regard to the use of evidence.",FernUniversität in Hagen,Hertie School,,,,,,,FernUniversität in Hagen,Hertie School,Sonja Blum,Nikolina Klatt,,,,,,,Sonja Blum,Nikolina Klatt,Public Policy,Social Policy,Knowledge,Education,Communication,Narratives,,,Scientific evidence in policy narratives.

0,"This article examines how scientific knowledge was channeled to policymakers in three different crises in Switzerland: the financial crisis, the Fukushima nuclear accident, and the Covid-19 pandemic. In recent years, governments have established institutions and processes to facilitate the use of scientific knowledge in policymaking. These science-for-policy mechanisms were, however, not always designed to channel scientific knowledge to policymakers in times of crisis. Crises are characterized by epistemological uncertainty and a high urgency to take decisions. The proposed paper draws on over 20 interviews with representatives of the Swiss public administration, government, and scientific community to investigate the use of scientific knowledge in the three different crises and to evaluate the observed science-for policy-mechanisms using criteria based on the concepts of input, throughput, and output legitimacy. Switzerland’s institutional setting with its neo-corporatist features, semi-direct democracy, and strong federalism favors democratic decision-making based on input legitimacy over technocratic decision-making based on evidence. The comparison of the three crises shows how pre-established science-to-policy mechanisms in the financial, nuclear, and health fields differently reacted to the crises. Preliminary results suggest that, in the financial crisis, scientific knowledge generated inside public administration was used in a technocratic decision-making process that enhanced output legitimacy, whereas in the nuclear field, established scientific advisory bodies were consulted but political decision-making and input legitimacy prevailed. During the Covid-19 crisis, the pre-established scientific advisory body and knowledge internal to public administration were replaced by an ad-hoc scientific task force that was created by members of the scientific community acting, at first, as issue advocates. While technocratic decision-making prevailed in the beginning of the pandemic, the prolongation of the crisis witnessed a change towards political decision-making and a questioning of the legitimacy of scientific advisors. In conclusion, the article discusses options for crisis resilient and legitimate science-for-policy mechanisms.

0,"This paper examines the contemporary movement “Scientists for Future” by applying the theory of “Contentious Politics” and with it the theory of “Contentious Performances” to the movement.  Defined by Charles Tilly (Tilly, Tarrow 2015) as interactions in which actors make claims bearing on someone else's interest, in which governments appear either as targets, initiators of claims, or third parties and based on a set repertoire of claim making tactics (Tilly 2008), the theories of contentious politics and contentious performance provide excellent theoretical frameworks for the analysis of this first-of-a-kind movement taking scientists out of their offices and onto the street.
Firstly, the paper introduces the movement “Scientists for Future” and by focusing on specific regional groups within the broader movement, provides a definition of the movement, it’s claims, portrays its forms of action and objectives. Key to this definition is also the consideration of any “self-definition” the groups might have given themselves and how these will later play out in the analysis of the movement as a potential actor of contentious politics. 
To this definition, the theory of contentious politics and with it that of contentious performances is applied. 
An introduction into the theories is given, key contributors and examples of groups that have been classified as movements within the realm of contentious politics as well as key forms of contentious performances are introduced. Key criteria of both theories are defined and applied to the defined Scientists for Future movement: their claim making, the addressed parties, their forms of action and performing thereof and processes identifiable within the movement.
The paper results in a novel definition of Scientist for Future as a movement of contentious politics and performances and with that it can achieve two things:  1) lay the base for further research into future actions and achievements of this group as a defined group within the realm of contentious politics and 2) serve as a practical insight into the processes of claim making and performance of this group to use these insights as guidance to make use of the theories of contentious politics and contentious performances for future successful actions to achieve the aims of the group.",International Solar Energy Society (ISES),,,,,,,,International Solar Energy Society (ISES),,Arabella Liehr,,,,,,,,Arabella Liehr,,Civil Society,Contentious Politics,Social Movements,Climate Change,Protests,Activism,,,"Scientists in the Streets – Science, Activism and a New Form of Contentious Politics and Performance?",https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64444&EventID=185
0,"Mass shooting incidents such as the shooting in Boulder, Colorado that left 11 people dead have drawn attention to the issue of gun violence in America. The issue of mass shootings, though troubling, only represent a small fraction of a gun violence problem in America that is struggling to be addressed in a hyper partisan American political landscape. Gun-related violence resulted in 44,910 deaths in America in 2021 according to the Gun Violence Archive.  While much focus is paid to regulation at the federal level, there has been little change in terms of federal firearms law enactments. There has been more activity at the local level in the regulation of firearms. Two cities, Seattle and Pittsburgh have attempted to regulate firearms in response to public health and safety concerns such as the shooting in Boulder and the shooting at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh. This paper considers the case studies of Pittsburgh and Seattle efforts to regulate firearms at the local level in order to illuminate the difficulties faced by local governments in America attempting to regulate firearms within their respective jurisdictions due, in part, to the perceived plenary power held by state governments within the intrastate legal systems in America. The local firearms regulations passed by the city governments of Pittsburgh and Seattle have faced legal challenges from individual and organisational plaintiffs that have argued such regulations are preempted by state law. From this, the paper shows the precarious position of local autonomy and local government authority with the US Federal constitutional system generally and specially in relation to the regulation of firearms.",Birmingham City University,,,,,,,,Birmingham City University,,Matthew Davis,,,,,,,,Matthew Davis,,Constitutions,Democracy,Federalism,Local Government,Political Parties,USA,,,Seattle and Pittsburgh: local regulation in the face of intrastate firearms preemption,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65839&EventID=185
0,"In summer 2021, thousands of People on the Move approached the Polish-Belarusian border. They were lured by the promises of smugglers and Belarusian authorities to access relatively safe passage to Western Europe. Migrants and asylum-seekers from the Middle East and North Africa, brought by airplanes to Belarus, joined the so-called Eastern Borders Migration Route through Belarus and Poland. Before, it was a path to safety for asylum-seekers from FSU (predominantly from North Caucasus). However, since 2015 Polish ruling party has been actively securitizing (Muslim) migrants and asylum-seekers (Cap, 2018; Follis, 2019; Krzyżanowski, 2017, 2020; Narkowicz, 2018). This discourse and practice resulted not only in refusal to accept the relocation of asylum-seekers from Italy and Greece but also in pushbacks of asylum-seekers from North Caucasus and Central Asia at the Polish-Belarusian border in the period of 2015-2019 (Klaus, 2021; Klaus et al., 2018; Szczepanik, 2018). 
The key argument of the study is that the securitization of asylum-seekers and the Eastern Borders Route by the Polish government led to exploitation of the issue by the external actor - Belarus. Within constructed political identity, based on the discourse of threat, the Polish government could not react differently than enhancing further securitization of migrants and asylum-seekers and declaring the state of emergency. This increased polarization in the public debate concerning asylum policy and human rights when humanitarian organizations attempted to counter governmental discourse and practice. The study’s primary goal is to understand the evolution of security and humanitarian discourses and practices in Poland before and after the intervention of external actor. 
Theoretically, the study lies down within the scope of Securitization Theory and constructivist approach to Human Security. It focuses on internal discourse and practice evolution and the role of external actor exploiting constructed identities and threats (Léonard & Kaunert, 2021; Webb, 2020).

0,"Since climate change adaptation has risen on the political agenda of the EU, so has the tendency to securitize it. This seems apparent from the recently published EU mission statement on climate change adaptation. But what about securitization at the national level of EU member states? This paper aims to understand how and to what extent climate change adaptation has become securitized in national policy in The Netherlands. It does so by comparing the level of securitization for different adaptation issues, based on content analysis of 18 sectoral national policy documents and 6 in-depth interviews with national policy makers and experts. Manifestations of riskification and threatification - representing different levels of securitization - are analyzed with respect to the discourses used, and the actors and tools that are put forward to address the climate risk/threat. The results show that climate change has made Dutch flood risk governance even more prominent: it has been framed as a wake-up call to speed up the plans of the longstanding Delta program to protect The Netherlands against flooding. There is also a clear difference between the level of securitization for different adaptation issues. Where flood risk governance has become ‘securitized’, mainly in terms of tools such as a dedicated Act, Program, Fund and Commissioner, health related climate issues have not. Furthermore, most attention goes to adaptation in the built environment, while neglecting the social and health care domains and the need to take account of the characteristics and capabilities of at-risk citizen groups. We conclude that adaptation is both advocated and dealt with in a decentralized manner, as manifested in the collaborations of different public and private actors at different scales of governance and in different governance sectors. Nevertheless, some recent developments propagate the need for more centralized guidance from the national government.",University of Utrecht,,,,,,,,University of Utrecht,,Heleen Mees,,,,,,,,Heleen Mees,,Climate Change,Domestic Politics,Policy-Making,,,,,,Securitized or not?

0,"Several countries introduced their strategies for transition to a circular economy (CE). China adopted The Circular Economy Promotion Law in 2008. The European Commission put forward an initial CE package in 2014 led by several EU countries introducing national CE strategies (Finland, Sweden, Spain, France, etc.). Transformation of linear economy practices into circular economy implies innovations on a systemic level to change production and consumption patterns in societies. Several studies on circular economy suggested that implications of circular policies go beyond the geographical borders of a country. For example, the European CE package was followed by collective initiatives in specific areas (the European Battery Alliance, the European Plastics Alliance) that address security concerns of European countries and can affect security perceptions of other countries. The literature explored the role of recycling in the supply security issue of critical materials. However, the broader security implications of the circular economy transformation are unexplored. 

This study synthesizes academic literature on circular economy in connection with security perspectives on different levels (national, international, human, environmental). The research aim is to identify conceptual connections between circular economy and security and create an analytical framework for policy analysis. Two research questions formulated for this study are: what security concerns affect circular economy policy design, and what are the effects of the circular policies on security? The analytical framework contributes to understanding driving factors behind circular economy policies, to a comparison between circular policies in different regions, and to an assessment of possible outcomes of these policies.

0,"While the public bureaucracies across South Asia, including in Indian-administered Kashmir, are generally- and rightfully- represented as glacial in their functioning, in the context of India’s military rule of Kashmir, these same bureaucracies can assume a periodic efficiency. In the aftermath of the abrogation of Kashmir’s nominal legal autonomy in 2019, this periodic efficiency has been demonstrated by civil bureaucracies in a much starker way to massively accelerate what has been described as India’s settler-colonial goals in the region. In the paper, I describe the modalities of these periods of efficiency- which I call selective efficiency, the aims of this efficiency in Kashmir and, more importantly, how people at the receiving end of this efficiency perceive it. 

In this context of sustained conflict and military occupation, I will question the otherwise desired efficiency of public/state bureaucracies while proposing that, in certain situations/places such as Indian-administered Kashmir, the glacial- even corrupt- nature of public bureaucracies may in fact produce positive results for the local population.

0,"The manuscript explores a recent development of China’s efforts as a peacekeeping policy leader. China is a key node in the UN peacekeeping regime; simultaneously, a UN Security Council permanent member setting political guidance; the second largest peacekeeping budget funder, and the largest troop contributor amongst its permanent peers, for example. However, for all its contributions, China offers comparatively little in terms of peacekeeping policy design. One area that China is emerging as a policy leader is on peacekeeper safety and security.  This paper explores why China – a state that has only recently fielded combat troops in its three-decades of troop deployment – focuses on peacekeeper fatalities.  The manuscript argues that China’s combat peacekeeper fatalities due to ‘malicious acts’ are a catalyst for PRC policy leadership on peacekeeper safety and security. Drawing from Chinese-language authoritative and semi-authoritative sources, I find that China’s approach to addressing peacekeeper safety and security has three trends. First, China actively seeks to manage accident and illness-related fatalities with a top-down, state-led, technical approach of better training and equipping of detachments. Second, China sees the host state as responsible for ensuring peacekeeper safety and security. Third, China offers less comment on the ‘more dangerous’ environment or the use force, though China is critical of overly-expansive mandates and the robust use of force.",Macquarie University,,,,,,,,Macquarie University,,Courtney Fung,,,,,,,,Courtney Fung,,China,UN,Peace,,,,,,Sending Talent to International Organizations: A Case study of China,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63360&EventID=185
0,"Party group coordinators are key actors in the European Parliament's committees given their participation in coordination meetings that decide on procedural and substantive aspects of committee work (e.g. the allocation of rapporteurships; committee hearings), or their role in the formulation of the group's position and in steering negotiations on specific policies (Hix and Hoyland 2014; Ripoll Servent 2019). 
Daniel and Thierse (2018) focused on group coordinators in EP8 and showed that their selection was positively influenced by committee seniority and by having been a group coordinator in the past, whereas pure expertise, ties with interest groups and the degree of loyalty to the party group do not seem to matter.

0,"Hydrogen is widely expected to become a globally traded commodity, and several countries are preparing to become importers or exporters (IRENA, 2022). Considering the similarities between natural gas and hydrogen in terms of transport and storage, a global hydrogen market is often expected to develop in a similar way to the global natural gas market. However, little attention has been paid to what exactly these similarities are and what they can teach us about the timing, sequence and consequences of creating an international hydrogen market. To shed light on this question, this paper examines the evolution of natural gas import dependencies in Belgium, drawing on literature on the history of technology and trans-border networks and infrastructure (e.g. Hogselius et al, 2013). Similar to natural gas and LNG, Belgium is expected to import nearly all of its hydrogen demand. We review how the Belgian natural gas market evolved from the time the first natural gas molecules crossed the Dutch-Belgian border in 1966 until today, where Belgium like other European states is hit by high gas prices due to overall shortages. By mapping this evolution we seek to identify tipping points, opportunities, and pitfalls that may be relevant for the development of a hydrogen market in Europe as a whole, and Belgium in particular. The paper attempts to provide insights into what to expect from the development of a regional or global hydrogen market in terms of timing, volumes, sequences, etc. and prevent us from making the same or similar mistakes.",Ghent University,Ghent University,,,,,,,Ghent University,,Marie Dejonghe,Thijs Van de Graaf,,,,,,,Marie Dejonghe,,Trade,Energy,Energy Policy,,,,,,Setting up international hydrogen value chains: lessons from natural gas trade,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65652&EventID=185

Indeed, about a third of all coalitions terminate early due to coalition conflict. This paper examines how the power asymmetries among coalition parties affect conflictious government turnover. One main factor, we argue, is the PM party's credible options to exit the current government and to form an alternative one. The higher the probability leading to an alternative, ideologically more compatible government, the lower the costs of replacing ``trouble makers'' in the ruling cabinet. For the empirical investigation of our theoretical expectations, we rely on a newly compiled data-set that combines the coalition-inclusion probabilities of parties in 25 parliamentary democracies with data on coalition conflict and cabinet duration. With the help of survival analysis, we estimate cabinet stability for 356 coalitions between 1945 and 2020.

0,"Public agencies communicate strategically to protect and advance their reputations when representing themselves to the public via social media. Particularly during crises, such as the Covid-19 pandemic, an agency’s self-portrayal to the public can help to protect its jurisdictional turf and strengthen its reputational uniqueness. While prior reputational studies have shown that agencies are attentive to the media and political principals when crafting these communicational strategies, they have not assessed how inter-agency dynamics might shape their public outreach and message. This paper argues that if multiple public agencies are confronted with a shared salient issue, such as the Covid-19 pandemic, they engage in a strategy of ‘issue-segmentation’: mindful of each other’s distinct jurisdictional and reputational profiles, their communication centers around sub-issues that do not overlap with core missions of other agencies. We assess this expectation via a study of Twitter communication of 38 European Union agencies related to the Covid-19 pandemic. Using an automated thematic analysis of tweets, we show that agencies engage in issue-segmentation and focus their communication on unique sub-issues.

0,"In the course of electoral competition, parties may find themselves compelled to change their policy positions. Even if these changes are motivated by substantive policy concerns, changing policy may be written off as vote-seeking behavior by voters, adversely affecting the credibility of the party's position. Since parties are not legally bound to enact their campaign promises, there is considerable uncertainty about what parties will actually do once in office. How can voters tell whether parties actually mean what they say or are willing to say just about anything to get elected? And what policy changes can parties make without losing their credibility? We propose that voters use the direction of the policy shift as a signal of whether a party is motivated by and committed to policy and not merely by winning office. Shifting to an unpopular policy position is a costly signal of principled motives, while a shift to a popular position signals opportunistic motives. We test our theory using survey experiments with both hypothetical parties and the real case of Social Democrat accommodation on the immigration issue in Sweden. We find that policy shifts signal motivations and commitment in the expected ways but the effects on commitment are less pronounced for the real world case.

0,"Many citizens no longer believe in the legitimacy of representative democratic institutions. Especially so-called populist citizens are highly skeptical of representative politics. Some scholars propose that participation in deliberation will reconcile populist citizens with representative democracy. Yet so far we do not know how populist citizens react when they are involved in deliberative events. Several studies have found that populist citizens support deliberation as a (more) legitimate means of decision-making. However, these studies shed no light on how populist individuals experience the process and what their attitude is towards the outcome. 
This paper seeks to fill this gap by studying the legitimacy perceptions of (non-)populist participants to three participatory budgeting events in the Netherlands, each of which included a sizable deliberative component. We focus on a crucial component of legitimacy perceptions: outcome acceptance. This has been found to depend on either instrumental, relational or normative considerations. In addition to studying the individual effects of these considerations on outcome acceptance, this paper analyses the interaction between the three. This is particularly relevant when studying populist individuals since their normative framework is very likely to influence the belief that one’s opinion is heard and respected, and to influence how one assesses the likelihood of getting what one wants. 
This paper thus seeks to establish (1) the level of outcome acceptance among populist participants to participatory budgeting events compared to non-populists, (2) whether decision acceptance among populist participants is driven by instrumental, relational or normative considerations, and (3) whether there is an interaction between the three considerations. In doing so this paper sheds light on the mechanisms that determine perceptions of legitimacy in those individuals that are most sceptical of representative democratic institutions. In this paper we take a mixed-methods approach: we use survey data on participants in three participatory budgeting events in the Netherlands: Duiven, Maastricht and Amsterdam. We further probe the causal mechanism by including an analysis of semi-structured interviews with (non-)populist participants to the three participatory budgeting events.",Radboud Universiteit Nijmegen,Radboud Universiteit Nijmegen,University of Leuven,,,,,,Radboud Universiteit Nijmegen,,Rosa Kindt,Kristof Jacobs,Lisa van Dijk,,,,,,Rosa Kindt,,Democracy,Political Participation,Populism,Public Opinion,,,,,"Should you choose to accept it.

0,"After the 25th of January revolution in Egypt, donors have shown an increasing interest to support the spreading of democratic and liberal norms through financing civil society activities. Training and capacity-building activities for youth on civic and political engagement, human rights, and electoral processes were increasing.  The weak role of political parties in youth civic and political rights education, before 2011, has left a gap that should have been filled. Civil society organisations stepped in after the uprising to fill this gap through undertaking political education programmes aiming to foster youth engagement in the public sphere. A few years after the revolution, however, shrinking civil society spaces in Egypt have made it impossible to further continue supporting such activities. 
Despite donor funding to youth programs in Egypt, civil society organisations were not able to advance these programs and consolidate their existence as influential actors in supporting youth participation, mainly due to restrictions imposed on civil society organisations. In contrast, the state has continued to enact legislations that aimed to depoliticise the various civic spaces, either it is informal through civil society organisations or formal through the MoYS youth centres. Moreover, several initiatives were launched by the government to control youth political participation and create a new youth elite that is aligned with the government narratives. These efforts have skewed the role civil society organisations have played after the 2011 uprising through donor-funded youth programs. 
In this paper, I examine how political shifts impact donors driven civil society efforts in the realm of youth political participation programs? And how do authoritarian regimes reshape youth participation initiatives to support their rhetoric and gain regime loyalty? I argue that the increasing emphasis on the participation agenda and the role of civil society organisations in promoting youth participation, should not be seen in isolation from the rapid transformation of civic spaces, especially in the global south, where formal and informal institutions are used to co-opt civil society organisations and youth segments to ensure loyalty to the ruling regimes. 
This paper is based on single case study research and Egypt serves as the main case of analysis. While the main time frame of this paper is between 2014-2020, I trace back some of the state tactics implemented during the Mubarak regime to shed light on similar patterns towards youth-co-optation.  The methods used are based on a legal analysis of two recent legislation that impacted youth and civil society participation namely, law no. 149 of 2019 of civil society organisations and youth institutions law no. 218 of 2017. As well as a secondary review of newspapers, civil society organisations statements, and literature review of previous scholarly work on youth political participation in the aftermath of the 2011 Arab spring.","Department of Public Administration, Erasmus University Rotterdam",,,,,,,,"Department of Public Administration, Erasmus University Rotterdam",,Ahmed Elassal,,,,,,,,Ahmed Elassal,,Civil Society,Democratisation,NGOs,Youth,,,,,Shrinking civic spaces: the skewing role of civil society organisations and the state in promoting youth political participation in Egypt,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63870&EventID=185
0,"Post-2010 Hungary is a well-documented case of democratic backsliding or illiberal political transformation. These developments affected, among others, the constitution, the system of checks and balances, the media, and civil society as well. Governmental funding of civil society was curtailed and put under political control, while human rights NGOs have been attacked by means of both political communication and legal regulation. This paper focuses on how illiberal politics have changed the practices of governance understood as policy making; how these changes have affected the opportunity structure of advocacy groups in influencing policy making; and how advocacy groups have adapted their strategies as a response to the illiberal challenge.

Based on a series of interviews conducted with the representatives of advocacy groups as well as members of the central administration the paper investigates the changing patterns of policy advocacy in three arenas: the venues of social dialogue, the arena of direct lobbying, and the arena of activism and mobilization. The expectation of the research – in line with the prediction of the opportunity structure theory – was that the purposive undermining of social dialogue by the government will spur advocacy groups to redefine and relocate their activities into the arena of lobbying and, even more, that of activism. As the Hungarian government has a clear populist appeal including a sensitivity towards public opinion, the expectation was that policy advocacy is still possible through changing the public mood and mobilizing the public. Some cases, like the successful civic mobilization for a more stringent penal policy on domestic violence or the one against Hungary organizing the Olympic games, illustrate the potential of policy change through activism. However, the general picture seems bleaker.  Illiberal politics have got a grip on both formal and informal policy venues which makes lobbying more difficult for advocacy groups. Mobilization and activism have been also hindered by a series of factors, including new strike regulation; drying up NGOs’ funding; growing political control over the media; growing social apathy fuelled also by purposive political intimidation by the government; and a general transformation of the public sphere in which policy debates have been washed away by polarizing discourses and instrumental political communication. The paper’s general conclusion is that the long time span of illiberal politics in Hungary has made possible a number of deep social transformations which strongly affect advocacy groups and their activities as well.",Centre for Social Sciences,,,,,,,,Centre for Social Sciences,,Zsolt Boda,,,,,,,,Zsolt Boda,,Civil Society,Democratisation,Interest Groups,Policy-Making,,,,,Shrinking venues: advocacy groups in illiberal governance.

0,"This paper investigates policy responses to homelessness across cities in the United States. As levels of unsheltered homelessness have continued to rise and new vulnerabilities to homelessness emerge amidst multiple crises facing major U.S. cities, the treatment of persons experiencing homelessness and the policy responses of cities to this crisis have gained renewed attention in the United States and beyond. The perceived inability of cities to adequately address rising levels of homelessness raises larger questions about inequality in wealthy economies and the ability of local governments to respond to urgent social needs. However, while the local level is responsible for the provision and management of homelessness services, policy choices are shaped by actors at different levels of government, with the federal government increasingly positioning itself as a strategic planning entity. Conceptualizing the urban environment as a site of governance, this paper studies the role of external pressures, particularly federal policy incentives, in shaping municipal policymaking. Using an original dataset on local adoption of three federal policy incentives, this paper suggests that cities generally follow federal policy impetus in this policy field, but vary with regard to adoption speed. To understand what drives this variation, this paper uses a multi-method approach– event history analysis and qualitative case studies–to analyze the political, institutional, and contextual factors affecting the speed of adoption at the local level. The focus on policymaking at the municipal level fills an important gap in the academic literature on homelessness, which thus far neglects the complex policy processes at play and an assessment of patterns of policy responses across the United States. Further, understanding the political, institutional, and contextual factors affecting the speed of policy adoption allows for an analysis of the local conditions enabling intergovernmental cooperation more broadly. Centering the city in investigating the dynamics of policy development and adoption in multi-level systems of governance contributes insights for a variety of policy fields, and allows for a nuanced understanding of the complexity of policy making at the municipal level and the role of individual actors, local conditions, and intergovernmental pressures in determining policy choice.",Freie Universität Berlin,,,,,,,,Freie Universität Berlin,,Laura Kettel,,,,,,,,Laura Kettel,,Federalism,Social Policy,USA,Welfare State,Mixed Methods,,,,Sites of Homeless Governance: Federal Innovation and Patterns of Local Policy Adoption,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63320&EventID=185
0,"In Western Europe, politicians and media express concerns about whether Muslims feel part of liberal democracies and trust parliament and government, generally made up of established parties. Although it is often assumed that Muslims do not (fully) accept the political system, previous research is actually inconclusive on whether Islamic religiosity hampers political trust. Current study dives into this complex association by studying over five thousand Muslims across 18 Western Europe countries. It makes two contributions. First, instead of comparing Muslims to non-Muslims, we address Muslims in specific to gain understanding in how various dimensions of religiosity -individual identification, prayer and mosque attendance- relate to political trust. Second, we introduce and test institutional conditions that can buffer or aggravate Islamic religiosity’s impact on political trust using an embedded-agency framework. We theorize how formal boundaries (e.g. the party systems’ proportionality) and informal boundaries (e.g. the presence of PRR parties) affect how Islamic religiosity translates into political trust. Using a unique harmonized dataset using ESS, EVS and WVS data, multilevel analyses present insight in these potentially context-dependent relationships. This study thus offers previously absent insights in what dimensions of Islamic religiosity relate to Muslims’ political trust in Western Europe, and under which conditions.",Radboud Universiteit Nijmegen,,,,,,,,Radboud Universiteit Nijmegen,,Nella Geurts,,,,,,,,Nella Geurts,,Comparative Politics,Islam,Religion,Quantitative,,,,,Situating Muslims’ political trust: A cross-national comparison in Western Europe,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64445&EventID=185

The analysis showed that the key words associated with DI are seldom used in parliamentary debates, coalition programmes or prime ministerial speeches. This suggests that the issue of DI is more a topic of academic discussion than of daily politics. While the low salience of DI in Slovenian political debates makes it hard to establish governmental positions in detail, the common thread throughout Slovenian foreign policy from independence in 1991 onwards has been that a strong and united EU is of key importance for Slovenia. The few instances where wording related to DI models was used reflect a concern about a multi-speed Europe, especially a fear that a multi-tier EU would mean fewer opportunities for future Slovenian governments and in general, fewer opportunities for smaller and/or less developed countries.",University of Ljubljana,University of Ljubljana,,,,,,,University of Ljubljana,,Maja Bucar,Bostjan Udovic,,,,,,,Maja Bucar,,European Union,Differentiation,Member States,,,,,,"Slovenia: a case of a small, relatively new member country",https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=62288&EventID=185
0,"Is digitalization a process that weakens, strengthens or ignores democratic participation? Amidst the crisis of liberal democracy, the search for innovative democratic formats has taken on a new and urgent relevance. At the same time, the proliferation of digital information and communication has raised expectations about new approaches of ‘democratizing the democracies’. Building political and social trust as well as broad, equal, protected and mutually binding patterns of communication and consultation, or - as Charles Tilly noted, political inclusivity – are considered to be core mechanisms for deepening democracy. Local participation plays a crucial role in that perspective as it is a particular form of citizen participation in decision-making that gives people a greater sense of ownership of public affairs and increases public engagement. It also encourages people to listen to a diversity of opinions and contributes to greater legitimacy of decisions. Consequently, the question arises whether the current trend towards the digitalization of urban and regional development, in particular projects such as smart city concepts and the digitalization of public affairs, holds opportunities for a revitalization and advancement of democratic trust and local participation.
To analyze the prospects and obstacles of digitally-enhanced democracy, we propose a theoretical approach that links the concept of connective action with digitally enhanced political communication. Connective action can be understood as public action that contributes to a common good as an “act of personal expression and recognition or self-validation achieved by sharing ideas and actions in trusted relationships” (Bennett/ Segerberg 2021: 752-53). Digital Connective Action can be understood as public (digital) action as an active contribution to the common good, based on social embeddedness - shared ideas, joint action and social trust - on the one hand, and individualistic claims of self-development, recognition and resonance on the other. The core question is whether and how digital urban processes may both profit from and foster digital connective action as a mode of local participation.
Our paper aims to shed light on the extent to which digitally enhanced political communication can remedy the elitist bias of representative democracy and contribute to building trust and mutual binding consultation and thereby, to foster democratic inclusivity. The elaboration of a theory of digitally-enhanced democratization is based on an empirical study on the city of Frankfurt (Oder) and its urban development policy process of digital transformation in the sense of a smart city concept. This study is a status quo, needs and potential analysis of the contribution of Digital Connective Action to the further development of democracy in the digital age and helps to understand the innovative potential of local digitalization concepts for democratic inclusivity.",Europa-Universität Viadrina,Europa-Universität Viadrina,,,,,,,Europa-Universität Viadrina,,Jürgen Neyer,Susann Worschech,,,,,,,Jürgen Neyer,,Civil Society,Democracy,Local Government,Political Participation,Public Administration,Political Sociology,Communication,Technology,"Smart City, Smart Participation?

0,"To what extent does social categorisation deprive people of their dignity, affecting individuals’ radicalisation processes? While existent literature contributes significant knowledge on groups’ radicalisation and how socio-political, historical, and economic factors affect the outbreak of violence, we still lack a comprehensive understanding of how and why individuals radicalise. To this end, this paper investigates the Italian case of far-Left violence, which took place between the early 1970s and the mid-1980s, during the so-called ‘years of lead’. The intensity and scope of violence makes this an interesting case for researching individuals’ radicalisation processes. Using narrative analysis as methodological approach, this paper surveys personal stories of former members of far-Left armed organisations. It examines how they perceived the socio-political world that they intended to change, scrutinising (auto)biographical material to explain the complexity behind individuals’ decision to use violence. It also engages with socio-psychological literature to explore the multifaceted components constituting violence. This paper finds that society’s practice of categorising people can lead to violence by contributing to some individuals’ radicalisation processes. It appears that by morally judging, social categorisation promotes social divisions, harming people’s dignity. Ultimately, this paper provides thought-provoking insights for research in (de)radicalisation, peace, and conflict.",University of Kent,,,,,,,,University of Kent,,Giulia Grillo,,,,,,,,Giulia Grillo,,Conflict,Extremism,Political Psychology,Political Violence,,,,,Social categorisation and rise of violence: how deprivation of human dignity becomes the linking tile between moralistic categories and the rise of violence in society,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=62634&EventID=185
0,"This paper examines a 10-year engagement between Queen’s University and social enterprises involved in urban regeneration in inner-city Belfast. Resisting growth-centred local development and broad neoliberal modes of planning, the work aimed to support an alternative community wealth building approach, centred primarily on a network of asset-based social enterprises.  The programme consists of applied research, market and sectoral analysis, project evaluation and social return and local multiplier methods aimed primarily at community businesses. However, it also developed conceptual, comparative and best practice analysis to argue for a stronger regulatory, financial and skills environment to help scale the social economy. Conscious of a distinct ‘local trap’ in places characterised by weak demand, lack of cash and poor access to capital, the research sought to strengthen the wider ecosystem for community wealth building. For example, a Knowledge Transfer Partnership (KTP) aimed to strengthen innovation and market diversification, but also placed pressures on social enterprises concerned about their tradition, value base and commitment to neighbourhood. Here, the paper reflects on tensions within and between the community and researchers and the need for an ethic of objectivity to challenge understandings, assumptions and demands of neighbourhood groups and in particular, social enterprises.  The analysis concludes by reflecting on the value of university-led research partnership; the need to integrate research with education and capacity building; effective governance models; and for better engagement skills among researchers as well as the researched.",Queen's University Belfast,Queen's University Belfast,,,,,,,Queen's University Belfast,,BRENDAN MURTAGH,Linda Fox-Rogers,,,,,,,BRENDAN MURTAGH,,Governance,Higher Education,Activism,,,,,,"Social economies, community wealth and applied research",https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63493&EventID=185

Work inspired by both reference group theory and social identity theory approaches has documented the importance of voters’ perceptions of and identification with social groups for their political behaviour. Yet, the specific mechanisms behind such effects remain underexplored. In order to illuminate the workings of this group effect, the paper analyses the conditioning role of group perceptions as well as perceived group-party linkages on support for parties at the individual level. Using experiments covering 12 different social groups embedded in a survey of Danish voters, the paper examines the extent to which party sympathy and voting behaviour are influenced by group sympathy, group identification and perceived group deservingness. Further, it examines how any such influences are conditioned by voters’ perceptions of the linkages between groups and parties in the shape of the groups’ perceived voting behaviour and parties’ perceived stances vis-à-vis the groups.",Aarhus Universitet,,,,,,,,Aarhus Universitet,,Rune Stubager,,,,,,,,Rune Stubager,,Political Parties,Identity,Electoral Behaviour,Voting Behaviour,,,,,Social group perceptions and party choice,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64024&EventID=185

0,"Online social networks become an unexpected variable in the equation of conflict development and resolution, and existing research has identified opposing influences: a polarizing effect that further divides the opponents (Bail, 2018; Warren, 2015; Miro-Llinares & Rodriguez-Sala, 2016; Awan, 2016; Ben-David & Matamoros-Fernandez, 2016; Mondal, et al., 2017), but also positive effects (Zeitzoff, 2018), a bridging effect that creates common ground, and can even be used as a potential peace-building tool (Mor et al., 2016; Sutzl, 2016; Barbera, 2014). The research focuses on Israel and the Palestinians, and it aims to improve understanding about the role of social media during conflicts, by examining narratives in this platform. 

Narratives have a significant role in times of conflicts, as they provide justification and explanation to the conflict, causes for its eruption, its dynamic, their own society, the rival’s society, and the desired solution (Bar-Tal, 2007, 2013; Bar-Tal, Rosen, & Nets-Zehngut, 2009; Kriesberg, 1993; Salomon, 2004; Elkins, 2005; Hammack, 2011). Those narratives become a part of the cycle that perpetuates conflicts (Bar-Tal 2007, 2013), and they are an important target for change, when promoting inter-group reconciliation (Salomon, 2004).

Social media is one of the channels for constructing and disseminating narratives of conflicts, and it is seen nowadays as an important player during conflicts (The New York Times, 7-8.9.2019). In this platform, dominant actors can be challenged by alternative actors with less resources, visibility, and attention (Fuchs, 2010). The linear model of communication has been changed (McQuail, 1970), and the privilege to take part in the public sphere is now extended beyond the traditional political influencers and opinion leaders. Any social media user can expand the role from being part of the audience, to function also as content producer. This way, alongside the institutional producers of media content, new online media platforms have contributed to the development of content generated by the audience itself (Rosen, 2006). This is one of the characteristics of this platforms which can make it more pluralistic, especially compared to traditional media.

The overarching research question explores whether social media can be an alternative platform that undermines the mainstream narrative about a conflict. The existing narratives in social media can be either polarizing, if they are similar to the hegemonic narratives which support the conflict’s continuation and escalate the relations between groups; or alternatively, they can have a bridging effect, as individuals are exposed to different framing and point of views, which usually get less expression and exposure in the public sphere.

The conference presentation will focus on the communicators, relevant actors who disseminate messages about a conflict - politicians, NGOs, and individuals such as activists and journalists. They make conscious or unconscious framing judgments in deciding what to say, guided by frames that organize their belief systems (Entman (1993). Using semi-structured interviews, I will present how the communicators frame the content and construct their narratives, how they perceive their acceptance by the public, and what is the role of social media during conflicts, as they see it.",University College Dublin,,,,,,,,University College Dublin,,Dana Guy,,,,,,,,Dana Guy,,Conflict,Conflict Resolution,Media,Political Psychology,Social Media,Narratives,,,Social Media and Narratives during Intractable Conflicts: The Case of Israel and the Palestinians,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64962&EventID=185
0,"This paper analyses the role of the public’s opinions expressed on social media (Weibo in particular) in influencing the Chinese government’s policies to combat Covid-19. Specifically, we answer the following research questions: to what extent was the Chinese government responsive to netizens’ opinions (overall salience/tone/specific focus and proposed solutions) in its policy reactions to the pandemic? For which types of issues was the government more likely to respond to changes in netizens’ level of attention and opinions? Which other variables (relating to the issue as well as the reactions in Weibo) help to explain the government reaction or inaction to changes in netizens’ attention and opinions? A number of previous studies have examined the role of netizens in Chinese politics, but few studies have focused on understanding how opinions expressed on social media might affect policy decisions. And of these studies, most have exclusively examined single case involving events that were selected precisely due to their very high salience in social media – such as scandals and natural disasters. This lack of research on social media influence over policy is marked in authoritarian systems generally, not only for China. Indeed, even for democratic countries, we still know surprisingly little about when and how governments (i.e. under which particular circumstances) respond to changes in opinion in social media and even less about how this might relate to substantive policy changes. 
To answer our questions, we use a mix of computational and manual content analysis drawing on a dataset of over 35 million COVID-19 related Weibo posts between 19th of January and 23rd of April 2020 (see Hu et al 2020). Our research design is unique in integrating this data with a novel hand-coded dataset of all policy and quasi-policy decisions made by the Chinese government during the same period. We then combine macro-analysis with in-depth case studies. The context of the pandemic crisis means that the whole policy process (i.e. agenda-setting, formulation and implementation) took place at unprecedented speed. This, combined with our research design, enables us to analyse when and how opinions in Weibo relate to policy change as well as examining the possibility of reciprocal influence, i.e. from the opinions expressed in Weibo to change in government policy as well as how netizens reacted to the government’s policy, which in turn might have influenced implementation or lead to new policy initiatives, as hypothesised by Wolfsfeld’ s Politics Media Politics model (PMP). The analysis will help us understand the degree and nature of the influence of the public, via social media, on policy change in crisis situations in an authoritarian political system. This paper will thus contribute to the literature on authoritarian government responsiveness in the digital era as well as to our understanding of the mechanisms that might explain social media impact in policy change, , and hence the factors that make influence more or less likely.",University of Glasgow,University of Glasgow,University of Glasgow,,,,,,University of Glasgow,,Jane Duckett,Ana Ines Langer,Hua Wang,,,,,,Ana Ines Langer,,Asia,Media,Agenda-Setting,Communication,Mixed Methods,Policy Change,Influence,,Social media and policy making: the influence of netizens on Chinese government policies during the COVID 19 pandemic.,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65345&EventID=185
0,"This paper examines student and faculty online activism as a response to declining democratic conditions and rising pressures over the character and political direction of universities in a time of rising authoritarianism. Turkey and Hungary represent examples of two countries that have both experienced democratic decline and further deterioration of academic freedoms and university autonomy (Bárd, 2020; Doğan & Selenica, 2021; Dönmez & Duman, 2020). Simultaneously, there are signs that some university spaces still maintain autonomous spaces through political actions energised by students and faculty to resist such authoritarianism (Brooks, 2016; Klemenčič, 2014). 
In Turkey, the culmination of online contentions has been the reaction to the Rector appointment by the government to Bogaziçi University in January 2019. Since 2016, following a state emergency decree, Erdogan began to appoint loyalists and activists of ruling AKP to the position of University Rector, without input from university stakeholders that constrained university autonomy and was interpreted as an interference into university decision-making (Dönmez & Duman, 2020). Student and faculty resistance to this appointment has taken place both on campus grounds and online on Twitter by hashtags: #KabulEtmiyoruzVazgecmiyoruz (#wedontacceptwedontgiveup) and #direnbogazici (#resistbogazici). In Hungary, students at the University of Theatre and Film Arts have occupied the university as a protest to the privatization of this school against the decision of the university senate in September 2020. This university is the seventh case in Hungary that has been transferred to the control of a pro-government private foundation funded and governed by the ruling Fidesz leader Orbán (Csoszó, 2020). The protests have been extensively discussed and organized on social media using the hashtag #FREESZFE on Twitter.
This paper explores the idea of universities as spaces for contentious politics that can ignite mobilizations, support and coordinate political contestation (Tarrow, 2011; Tilly, 2015). We draw in particular on the concept of “infrastructure of dissent” (Sears, 2005, 2014) in order to explore how contentious politics is organized in universities with a particular focus on social media is used and mobilised by protesters and their governments.
While the tools that governments use against political activism in HE, including surveillance, control and repression, have been researched to some extent (Altbach, 2017; Choudry, 2015; Choudry, 2019; Dillabough, 2021), the organization and development of academics’ resistance have been much less researched, particularly in the case of rising authoritarianism when student and academic activists face imprisonment, police brutality and potential death. In light of these considerations, this paper examines how contentious politics organized in universities under deteriorating democratic conditions and how Twitter is used to communicate in both case sites. We argue that social media analysis of activist practice serves as an important platform for examining the scope and spread of discontent in academia. Using netnography as a qualitative analysis tool (Costello et al., 2017), we draw on a hashtag analysis to track how Twitter 1) is drawn upon to mobilize dissent and form networks of activist alliances, 2) communicate this dissent transnationally, and 3) as a method of surveillance and repression tool of governments.",University of Toronto,University of Toronto,,,,,,,University of Toronto,,Zahra Jafarova,Elizabeth Buckner,,,,,,,Zahra Jafarova,,Conflict,Contentious Politics,Media,Populism,Knowledge,Comparative Perspective,Higher Education,Activism,Social media as a space for contentious politics in the age of rising authoritarianism: a comparative analysis of academic resistance in Hungary and Turkey,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65410&EventID=185
0,"In early July 2020, Mohammed Shahed, an industrialist and the owner of Regent Hospital in Dhaka, Bangladesh with strong connections with the political establishment was implicated in a case of issuing fake COVID-19 tests. The incident sparked outrage on social media with users pointing out that Shahed was well connected with the political top brass. Government agencies such as the Anti-Corruption Commission promised action against these irregularities soon (Abdullah 2020). By the third week of July 2020, Shahed was intercepted and sent to prison, and the social media intensity on the topic had reduced. The relatively brief period of intense online activity could be the result of increasing draconian laws such as the Digital Security Act of 2018 which has seen rapid curtailment of civil liberties online. Al-Zaman (2020) noted that the government ordered public employees to refrain from sharing any social media posts that criticised the government’s handling of the pandemic. Following this, our first research question asks: which are the features that characterize the brief yet powerful social media outrage on fake COVID tests in Bangladesh?
Here we focus on the potential of ‘digital sociality’ to explain such acts of resistance in contexts where collective action on highly contentious issues is dangerous. Borrowing from Postill and Pink (2012), we note that the focus cannot be on communities or cultures on the web but on qualities of social relationships which are shaped and re-shaped with the speed of activities happening in the online sphere. A second research question interrogates: How can we use digital sociality to explain the contentious politics that emerges from the case study? 
The primary data consists of 200 Facebook posts gathered in the first two weeks of July 2020 using the search terms #Shahed and #RegentHospital in Bengali; and five interviews with corruption and social media experts from Bangladesh. Respondents were identified through purposive sampling, and five of them accepted our invitation to speak on the matter. The relatively low number of posts on a trending topic can be understood through the lens of restrictions on social media posts critiquing the government. 
Following the logic of digital sociality which highlights the ephemeral nature of social media relationships and focuses on contextual fellowships, we propose to study this particular case of contentious political action in a repressed regime as an act of ‘resistance sociality’. In a quasi-authoritarian regime, stable networks of connected actors and activists are likely to be dismantled and prosecuted as it has been increasingly the case through systematic dismantling of Bangladesh’s civil society through legal instruments and punitive measures (Zamir 2014), but social media, and especially social media trends by virtue of their ephemeral nature, can provide a space for resistance for those individual voices who need not identify as part of a group and can remain anonymous when engaging in contentious action. We develop this conceptual category through thematic analysis (Clarke and Braun 2006) of primary data and propose it as a lens to interrogate similar occurrences in parallel settings.",Università di Bologna,Università di Bologna,,,,,,,Università di Bologna,,Anwesha Chakraborty,Alice Mattoni,,,,,,,Alice Mattoni,,Asia,Civil Society,Contentious Politics,Qualitative,Social Media,Corruption,Activism,,Social Media Backlash on Fake COVID-19 Tests: Corruption and Contentious Politics During the Ongoing Pandemic in Bangladesh,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65280&EventID=185

However, until recently, little comparative data existed to test such assertions. Even less is known about how migrants may access benefits in emerging welfare states in the Global South.

Furthermore, immigrant welfare rights continue to be differentiated along residency status and benefit type, with permanent migrants enjoying more rights than temporary ones, and access to social assistance being more restricted than access to unemployment insurance. Results also show that although immigrant rights are never equivalent to those granted to citizens, in all world regions there are examples of inclusion and exclusion.

Undoubtedly, the deepening of the economic crisis and  austerity measures in a hard-hit Member state such as Greece  resulted in significant setbacks, the emergence of new social risks , and a widening of inequalities in the field of social policy. While Greece’s strenuous efforts and economic strides to get out of the economic crisis have been publicly lauded,  the maintenance of certain economic  commitments in the post-memoranda era in conjunction  with the outbreak of the coronavirus clouded the prospects of a robust and quick recovery and cast a long shadow on social vulnerability issues.

In this article we focus on the role that British social workers have come to play in this context and analyse how official policy and rhetoric contribute to turning them into immigration officers. Drawing on original qualitative data collected in London, we show that such reconstitution of their professional role and everyday practice requires a substantial transformation of how they understand their own work and the aims of their organisation. By linking problems of destitution to migrant irregularity, shifting the financial burden to local authorities, and framing return as a solution that is in the migrants’ best interest, the government successfully fostered social workers’ involvement in two crucial aspects of its enforcement strategy: the creation of a ‘hostile environment’ for irregular residents; and the implementation of so-called ‘voluntary return’ policies. At a theoretical level, we link these transformations to the complex interplay of three “dispositional logics” identified by Foucault – law, discipline, and security – and show that it is precisely their interplay that reshapes institutions and (re)conditions organisational practices and individual subjectivities within them. Together, the logics of law, discipline and security help to resolve or overcome some of the ethical and practical contradictions that otherwise hamper social workers’ collaboration with the migration regime. We argue that Foucauldian dispositional analysis provides a useful perspective on the often surprisingly smooth internalisation of immigration control into public welfare institutions and other spheres of everyday life and social interaction.",University of Sussex,,,,,,,,University of Sussex,,Reinhard Schweitzer,,,,,,,,Reinhard Schweitzer,,Social Welfare,Immigration,Policy Implementation,,,,,,Social Work as Immigration Enforcement?

0,"Across Western Europe, both parties on the center-left and parties on the center-right have
suffered considerable electoral losses in past decades. Research has repeatedly demonstrated that
these parties are less appealing to younger voters. However, it is still unclear how persistent these
age patterns are and what causes them. Are they representing an age (i.e., life-cycle), a cohort (i.e.,
generational), or a time-specific (i.e., period) difference?
In this paper, I thus look at the electoral decline of Western European mainstream parties over the
past three decades by adding a cohort perspective to the downtrend of those parties. I analyze six
Western European countries’ cohort differences and aim at detecting both country differences, as
well as a general pattern. Having said this, I expect that the electoral crisis of mainstream parties is
due to a continuous and persistent decline of appeal among birth cohorts that have grown up in
more recent decades. These cohorts experienced their formative years in an era in which issues
from the socio-cultural dimension of politics were much more the subject of political conflicts.
The socialization experience within this political Zeitgeist hints that more recent cohorts have
developed a different hierarchy of dimensional salience with issue bundles from the socio-cultural
dimension ranking higher on that ladder. Western European mainstream parties, however, are less
connoted to this dimension of politics and should be persistently less popular among newer
cohorts, especially among those socialized in the 1980s, the 2000s, and 2010s. I thus expect that
age differences in Western European electorates are representing cohort differences and not lifecycle
or period differences. Furthermore, I argue that these differences are rooted in persistently
diverging perceptions of salience that cohorts have developed.
To disentangle the three different dimensions of age, I use data stemming from the European
Values Study (1981-2018), as well as individual-level data from national election studies. I apply
APC-logistic regressions relying on a generational scheme that fits the Western European context.
I also test how the perceived salience of socio-cultural issue-bundles accounts for cohorts’
diverging party preferences. Finally, to test for the robustness of the generational scheme and to
detect empirically existing boundaries, I use generalized additive models (GAMs).",University of Zurich,,,,,,,,University of Zurich,,Reto Mitteregger,,,,,,,,Reto Mitteregger,,European Politics,Electoral Behaviour,Voting Behaviour,,,,,,Socialized with “old cleavages” or “new dimensions”: An Age-Period-Cohort Analysis on electoral support for mainstream-left and mainstream-right parties in Western Europe,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64854&EventID=185
0,"Recent research on socio-economic inequality in political participation has emphasized socialization patterns as a key explanation (e.g. Akee et al. 2020). A tentative consensus has emerged that political involvement becomes resilient with age and hence unresponsive to economic experiences (Prior 2019). This insight has led to the conjecture that the socio-economic gradient in political participation really results from the long-term effects of unequal socialization patterns. In this view, experiences in youth and childhood tend to produce rather stable trajectories of political apathy or involvement. To the extent that socio-economic characteristics of families influence socialization, the foundations for political inequality would emerge before voting age and last far into adulthood. 
Despite some evidence pointing in this direction (Emmenegger et al. 2017; Jungkunz and Marx 2021), we still know little about how exactly unequal participation develops over the life course. A number of important questions remain unaddressed. At which point in the life-cycle do people typically make socio-economic experience that translate into the well-known income gradient in political involvement? Relatedly: at which point in the life-cycle is political involvement malleable enough to respond immediately to socio-economic shocks? What are the long-term consequences of adverse socio-economic experiences in youth or childhood for political socialization and involvement later in life? And which role do parents’ socio-economic experience play as opposed to personal experiences early and later in life? 
The main obstacle to addressing these questions arguably has been data availability. Most datasets cover the population from (or close to) voting age onwards. They hence do not allow observing potentially crucial processes taking place in youth and particularly childhood. To overcome this limitation, we rely on the youth questionnaire in the British Household Panel Survey / Understanding Society. They allow us to combine information on political interest at the age of 9-12 years, psychological characteristics of children, and parental socio-economic standing. With latent growth curve modelling, we show that political inequality emerges at a very young age and is likely mediated by negative effects of socio-economic problems on family life and child wellbeing. Moreover, our results show that childhood experience still have an independent effect on voting propensity in young adulthood.

0,"This paper proposes a theoretical framework regarding the potential emergence of a new cleavage induced by the digital revolution. Traditionally, party systems have changed due to large processes such as the industrial revolution or, more recently, globalization. We argue that digitalization constitutes a similarly profound technological change, affecting society and, consequentially, politics. Technological change induced by digitalization has already led to myriad regulations, transnational legal frameworks and jurisprudence in just about every corner of the world. Novel challenges and opportunities of digitalization increasingly enter the political arena. To what extent can the digital revolution (and subsequent politicization thereof) lead to the emergence of a new cleavage? We theorize that if objective conditions that predict how one is affected by digitalization (i.e. labour market position, education, digital skills) align with subjective identifications (e.g. perception of gaining or losing from further digitalization of society, aligning social identities), this provides fertile breeding ground for a nascent political conflict between what we conceptualize as “winners” and “losers” of digitalization. Our theoretical considerations are complemented with original focus group data and exploratory analysis of cross-national survey data. We discuss to what extent we can observe the start of a socio-structural divide – with potential for further politicization – caused by the digital revolution in Western societies.",University of Lucerne,University of Lucerne,,,,,,,University of Lucerne,,Alexander H.

It is and has been strongly shaped by perspectives and approaches from the political sciences, law, and economics – especially those areas of European studies that deal with core issues of EU integration and EU policymaking. Moreover, the field of European studies also has strong roots in the humanities and different branches of the cultural sciences, such as history, philosophy, and philology. In this area of European studies, the cultural, historical, and philosophical dimensions of European society, as well as its interaction and interpretation patterns, are at the center of attention. Sociology certainly has its own place within this wide array of approaches and traditions, taking an intermediary position in the field by combining institutional, interactionist, and interpretative approaches.

0,"Much has been written about the dynamic design and process of the Paris Agreement, with its iterative ‘pledge and review’-design locking nations in to provide voluntary commitments and review them over a five year cycle (Rajamani, 2016). This paper aims to add to existing assessments of the Paris Agreement, such as analyses into its review process (Raiser, Çalı, & Flachsland, 2022) by analysing its functions and dysfunctions from the lens of soft governance. It aims to answer the research question: “What does the literature on soft governance teach us about the functions and dysfunctions of the Paris Agreement’s pledge and review system?” In doing this, it also serves as a scoping exercise and overview of soft governance as it is used in academic literature through a narrative review (Petticrew & Roberts, 2006). This is supplemented by an evidence map of soft governance tools, such as naming and shaming dynamics, policy monitoring, policy coordination and goalsetting relying on voluntary targets and benchmarking.  
Building on these mapping exercises, the final section of the paper compares these findings to the empirical reality of the Paris Agreement through a theory-testing case study answering these final questions: what elements of the Paris Agreement’s pledge and review-design correspond with soft governance tools, what are their expected outcomes and what results can we already observe today?
The result is a comprehensive narrative overview of soft governance, an evidence-based overview of soft governance policy tools that can serve as the foundation for further analyses as well as a case study of the Paris Agreement, focusing on the expected and already observed effectiveness of the soft governance tools in its arsenal.

0,"The proposed paper engages with a central source of tension within the global energy transition to low-carbon societies and economies. Can Africa harness the opportunity provided by the transition to develop productive capabilities in the design, manufacture, and export of renewable energy technologies? Or, in a continuation of historical inequities and injustices in global trade and development, will the transition see Africa provide the raw materials required for the manufacture of clean energy infrastructure, while remaining dependent upon the import of the high-value final products?

The paper will explore this tension through a focus on solar energy, which has expanded rapidly across the continent over the last decade. To assess whether and to what extent this expansion is contributing to economic transformation on the continent, leading to a more diversified and autonomous economic structure, the paper adopts Hirschman’s linkages framework to review the existing literature on the topic. Hirschman proposed three major types of linkages from the commodities sector, which can be usefully transposed to energy: fiscal linkages from the commodities/energy sector in the form of corporate and others taxes accruing to the state; consumption linkages created by the demand for the output of other sectors stimulated by the expenditure of incomes earned in the commodities/energy sector, and; production linkages through producing inputs to be used in commodity/energy production.

Notably, existing studies have focused heavily on the issue of production linkages, to the exclusion of a concern with fiscal and consumption linkages. Existing global value chain mapping studies, produced predominantly by the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa, suggest the potential to develop these linkages in Africa is significant. While there is some empirical evidence to support this optimism, existing studies raise two associated questions. First, much of the evidence in this direction is clustered around the lower value-added segments of the solar value chain, and in particular productive activity related to the manufacture and distribution of solar lanterns or solar home system components. The extent to which this is serving or can serve as a springboard for domestic firms and entrepreneurs to move into higher value-added activities within the chain is an open question. Second, to what extent material inputs are being procured domestically or regionally in Africa is largely undocumented by the existing literature.
 
Reflecting on the existing state of knowledge concerning the impact of Africa’s expanding solar sector on sustained and transformative processes of economic development, perhaps the most striking observation is how relatively little we know beyond just a few countries. While the potential for the solar sector to contribute to economic transformation on the continent is well documented, the realisation of this potential remains relatively understudied, and is deserving of more attention from energy scholars and scholars of structural change and industrial policy in Africa. This is particularly urgent considering the dominance of foreign firms in the continent’s renewable energy sector, which in other sectors – such as mining – has historically functioned to undermine rather than support progress towards this goal.",University of Bath,,,,,,,,University of Bath,,Ben Radley,,,,,,,,Ben Radley,,Africa,Political Economy,Energy,Energy Policy,,,,,Solar Energy and Economic Transformation in Africa,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64037&EventID=185
0,"Devising viable policy solutions regularly requires that governments solicit intelligence from different sources of expertise. In parliamentary democracies, this means that multiple ministries are frequently expected to collaborate on legislative projects – either because policy issues are inherently cross-sectional, such as environmental matters, or because ministerial portfolios have been purposely designed to encourage inter-ministerial cooperation. We analyze to what extent cabinets live up to this expectation and indeed draw on the available expertise of multiple ministries to formulate policies. Our theoretical explanation for ministerial collaboration rest on three pillars: Administratively, joint ministerial efforts are more likely in policy areas that do not align with the portfolio structure, but touch upon the stakes of several ministries. Substantially, ministerial collaboration is more prevalent on projects that address salient policy issues. Lastly, concerning political leadership,  ministries led by strong ministers are more reluctant to engage in cooperation, because strong politicians can successfully fend off interference from their cabinet peers. We investigate these claims drawing on information about ministerial collaboration on all legislative projects sponsored by German governments, which we connect to recently elicited data on the distribution of policy responsibilities among German ministries from 1970 until today. Given that ministries imprint their own perspective on legislation, our results are beyond administrative pedantries, but have substantial implications for the type and content of policies governments formulate.",University of Zurich,University of Bamberg,University of Bamberg,,,,,,University of Zurich,,Klaus Jonathan Klüser,David Schmuck,Ulrich Sieberer,,,,,,Klaus Jonathan Klüser,,Government,Public Administration,Quantitative,Policy-Making,,,,,Soliciting Expertise from Colleagues: Ministerial Collaboration in Germany,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63549&EventID=185

However, we know relatively little about whether minority members themselves support immigration more or less than majority group members do, and what affects such inter-minority attitudes. Drawing on two competing theoretical perspectives, the minority solidarity thesis and intergroup threat theory, we argue that individual-level threats to minority group members´ identity in the form of discrimination experience make them more supportive of immigration, while structural identity threats in the form of assimilation pressure have the opposite effect. Based on evidence from the European Social Survey in 15 West European Countries as well as an original survey experiment we find support for our theoretical expectations. Minority members who report having experienced discrimination are more supportive of immigration than those who do not, and minority group members in countries with high assimilation pressure are less supportive of immigration than those in countries where such pressure is low.",Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München – LMU,European Centre for Minority Issues (ECMI),,,,,,,Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München – LMU,,Michael Neureiter,Felix Schulte,,,,,,,Michael Neureiter,,Integration,Migration,Identity,Immigration,Survey Experiments,Survey Research,,,Solidarity or Threat?

0,"Social movement scholars have extensively focused on solidarity ties between civil society organizations, emphasising that such ties encompass both a discursive dimension, where organisations express solidarity to other groups’ claims and actions, and a mobilising dimension, where organisations participate in other groups’ actions or engage in the organisation of joint activities. Researchers have also found that solidarity ties are more likely to be constructed across organisations with similar collective identity traits and framing strategies. Conversely, different collective identities may lead to conflicts, especially if these identities are mobilised around the sources of inequality (such as gender, sexuality, class, and race) that differently affect civil society organizations. 

Within this framework, movement scholars have described the LGBTQIA* collective action field as both rather internally fragmented and not tightly connected with other collective action fields. However, gender studies and feminist scholars have also emphasised that LGBTQIA* actors have often distinguished themselves from other identity-based organisations due to their focus on the diversity of LGBTQIA* identities and the promotion of a logic aimed at celebrating differences instead of monolithic identities. Following on these accounts, recent studies have discussed the emergence of so-called ‘intersectional solidarities’, emphasising that LGBTQIA* activists have increasingly addressed cross-cutting concerns and built solidarity ties with communities coping with intersecational inequality structures. 

Building on both social movement studies and gender scholarship, this paper addresses the discursive dimension of political solidarity and explores the digital solidarity ties created by LGBTQIA* organizations during the last decade. It does so by proposing an intersectional approach to political solidarity, where intersectionality is articulated both as an analytical lens to study how solidarity discourses deal with intersectional privilege and marginalisation, and as an empirical question to investigate its possible usage(s) by LGBTQIA* organisations. The aim of the paper is twofold. On the one hand, it sheds light on the multiple ways solidarity is signified and narrated in the digital sphere by LGBTQIA* organizations. On the other hand, it examines what collective action frames accompany different solidarity discourses, analysing how these frames evolve, travel, and are negotiated across contingencies. Particular attention is paid to the nexus between the mobilisation of intersectional frames and the creation of digital solidarity ties. To achieve these aims, the paper articulates a frame analysis of Facebook posts published between 2011 and 2020 on the public pages managed by LGBTQIA* organizations based in Milan and Madrid. These case studies allow us to compare how digital solidarities are articulated over time by LGBTQIA* activists embedded in different socio-political contexts. 

This paper aims to contribute to the study of political solidarity in several ways: firstly, by proposing an intersectional approach, it problematizes conventional social movement theories and explores their explanatory power in relation to sexuality and gender; secondly, it articulates an initial investigation of how digital communication platforms may be used by LGBTQIA* activists to articulate solidarity discourses; finally, it lays the preliminary ground to further investigate the relation between solidarity discourses and practices developed by LGBTQIA* collective actors.",Università degli Studi di Trento,,,,,,,,Università degli Studi di Trento,,Aurora Perego,,,,,,,,Aurora Perego,,Social Movements,Qualitative,Social Media,Solidarity,LGBTQI,,,,SOLIDARITY THROUGH DIVERSITY?

0,"This paper emphasises the performance of “sovereign agency” as a condition of an actors’ visibility and value in world politics and as a possible source of war. While the concrete social form of sovereignty varies strongly in its enactment from one actor to another, the norm of sovereignty as a fiction of total independency inside a political unity and of the capacity to shape world politics outside, remains a powerful cognitive frame. More specifically I argue that this sovereignty aspiration is as true for “state” as “non-state” political actors. In taking the case of actors convicted of “terrorism”, I argue that Jihadist violence is not “exceptional” and can be understood according to the frame of sovereignty that permeates world society and positivist science. Empirically, I will examine the role of agentic sovereign misrecognition through the case of French jihadism based on thirteen in-depth interviews with prisoners in France suspected to belong to Al Qaeda or the Islamic State. 

This paper stresses the performance of “sovereign agency” as a condition of an actors’ visibility and value in world politics and as a possible source of war. It is often held that states are eroding, faced with increasing interdependencies, but many political leaders continue to extensively use slogans like “popular sovereignty”, “energy sovereignty”, “cyber-sovereignty”, “health sovereignty”, or “nuclear sovereignty” to legitimate their politics. While the concrete social form of sovereignty varies strongly in its enactment from one actor to another, the norm of sovereignty as a fiction of total independency inside a political unity and of the capacity to shape world politics outside remains a powerful cognitive frame. We will first outline some reasons for the persistence of the sovereignty ideal in world politics. First of all, without recognition of sovereign attributes, a political unity is easily exposed to violence. In contemporary international relations the quality of the “sovereign subject” is denied to “developing countries” or “failed states “. It is not insignificant that “Western warfare” targets zones designated with limited sovereignty such as in Pakistan or in the Sahel zone. Second, the democratic ideal is territorially grounded in the nation state and political leaders display the “sovereign will” for their legitimacy. Democracy is also historically linked to the “levée en masse”. Thus, even leaders in so-called democratic states, consider that military power, nuclear weapons or “humanitarian” and “development” interventions define the boundaries of sovereignty and the actors which deserve recognition, thus defining the international pecking order. Finally, I will draw attention of the appeal to state sovereignty for actors socialized in positivist science or technical professions.",Institut d'Études Politiques de Lille,,,,,,,,Institut d'Études Politiques de Lille,,thomas Lindemann,,,,,,,,thomas Lindemann,,Conflict,Methods,Narratives,Peace,,,,,Sovereign misrecognition and international violence,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63452&EventID=185
0,"The paper aims to investigate nationalism in the post-Brexit period (2016-2020). Because of the negative consequences of Brexit on British politics and economics, nationalism has had to face the challenge to adapt to European integration and interdependence. This adaptation is here conceptualized as ‘sovereignism’. We identify commonalities and differences in the sovereignist narrative. In general, all sovereignists criticized the supranational character (institutional sovereignism) and the centralized policy system (policy sovereignism) which has developed within the EU. They also express concerns on dominance on the side of the EU and/or on the side of some member states over the others. Related to this is also the claim that sovereignism epitomizes the otherness compared to the so-called EU establishment. While sovereignism has used the argument about dominance as an attempt to define its identity in the political spectrum, it has so far failed to derive a specific vision of integration out of it. As a matter of fact, European sovereignists are still heterogeneous. They differ on the rationale of their criticism towards the EU, based more on an economic discourse (economic sovereignism) in western Europe and more on a cultural discourse (cultural sovereignism) in eastern Europe. If sovereignism aims to become the alternative to Europeanism from within the process of integration, the road to follow in order to define itself is still long.",Universität Konstanz,LUISS University,,,,,,,Universität Konstanz,,Tiziano Zgaga,Sergio Fabbrini,,,,,,,Tiziano Zgaga,,European Politics,European Union,Euroscepticism,Brexit,,,,,Sovereignism and the Future of Europe,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64644&EventID=185

With this data, we explore different change scenarios for countries with special representation, based on a combination between policy restriction versus policy innovation across elections.

0,"The massive structural and economic transformations in Western European countries in the past 50 years or so have seen the white working class (WWC) move from the centre to the fringes of political attention and social and cultural acknowledgement. This decline manifests itself in a continuous shrinkage since the 1970s, a lack of political representation and a set of values and beliefs widely shared within that class which position it in the authoritarian corner of the ‘new politics’ cleavage (Evans & Tilly 2016). A common theme with regard to the consequences of this marginalisation is the “backlashing” of said class in terms of opinions on lifestyle choices and identity politics leading to a highly polarized political landscape with a strong effect on the outcome of elections and referendums in recent years. The consequential assessment of a “culture war” raging especially in contemporary US but in different (and less explicit) ways also in other Western societies has been considered to one of the main driving factors of the erosion of the civic culture (Norris & Inglehart 2019). 
But how does this erosion show itself in the ways that members of the WWC engage politically and how does it affect notions of legitimacy with regard to the democratic system and its deliberative core? Footed in a wider theoretical conceptualisation of emotional or affective politics, the paper at hand addresses these questions in proposing a research agenda that seeks to establish a linkage between class and political attitudes with special regards to democratic legitimacy in selected, economically vulnerable regions in Germany and England. In addition, it seeks to identify the nodes which exist to fill the presumed vacuum between political will and representation, namely the various civil society organisations that have moved in to fill the gaps.
In a comparative approach, the paper focusses on two target regions in Eastern Germany and North England. Using a qualitative approach, the paper shows how distinct collective identities and accompanying values shape perceptions of democratic legitimacy and affect the political culture in the respective regions and communities. 
Given the size of this electoral group, its role for a functioning political culture can hardly be overestimated and, thus, getting it back in the boat of politic deliberation within the democratic system will prove vital to the functionality of Western democratic systems.

0,"There is, of course, a large literature concerning political recruitment and the pathways to elected office.  Much of this literature focuses on political parties and the continuing under-representation of women both in the pool of general election candidates and in Parliament.  In the aftermath of a significant increase in the number of women elected to the U.S. Congress in the 2018 elections, the prominent American sports journalist Christine Brennan wrote an intriguing article in which she observed that a significant number of these newly elected women had backgrounds in competitive sport.  A similar phenomenon can be observed in Canadian politics, where, for example, the Minister of the Environment in the past Liberal government, Catherine McKenna, regularly speaks of the importance of her participation in competitive sport as a crucial training ground for seeking and serving in elected office.  To date, however, there has been no rigorous examination of the role sport plays in the recruitment of candidates and the willingness of women to put themselves forward as candidates.  This paper seeks to begin to address this question.  In recent surveys of federal election candidates, local party association presidents and party members, I included questions relating to the sporting background of respondents.  Supplementing these data with an exhaustive examination of candidate and MP biographies and a series of open-ended interviews with politicians who have high-profile sporting backgrounds and party officials charged with candidate recruitment, this paper sheds light on the field of competitive sport as a fertile recruiting area for political candidates with an emphasis on questions of gender.

Stability may be linked to strong actors and their interests, or it can be that existing policy is based on ideas shared by a diversity of actors with different interests and thus supported by a joint coalition. Changes can be linked to new political framework conditions, shifts in technology and markets, and to new ideas shared by a majority of core actors within the policy area. It is an observation of a mix of stability and change that constitute the point of departure for this paper. In the early 1950’s the so-called canalization policy was implemented in Norway. Originally it was established to regulate production through adjusting the relative price difference between grain and livestock production. However, it soon became an instrument for differentiation of production in different parts of the country. The economic instruments were designed to promoted grain production in the areas that had the best natural conditions for this, while milk and meat were to be produced in the rest of the country. This policy has survived numerus changes in international framework conditions, national policy goals and internal changes in the industry. We use historical institutionalism as a theoretical framework, but we also utilize ideational theory. Both perspectives provide us with frameworks for analysing institutional stability and change. We will seek to answer the following question: Is the continuous support for the canalization policy primarily an effect of balancing powerful interest or is it based on shared ideas? What can explain why particular components from the old order survive almost untouched in the new?","Norwegian University of Science & Technology, Trondheim","Norwegian University of Science & Technology, Trondheim",Universitetet i Bergen,,,,,,"Norwegian University of Science & Technology, Trondheim",,Anders Melås,Jostein Vik,Arild Aurvåg Farsund,,,,,,Anders Melås,,Institutions,Public Policy,Policy-Making,,,,,,Stability in change in agricultural reform processes: The resilience of the Norwegian Canalization Policy,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63962&EventID=185
0,"Implementing AI-based technologies in public administrations has become a major theme on the agenda of governments all across Europe. The use of AI in social administration is particularly controversial among policy-makers, citizens, legal and technology experts. While AI applications in the public sector may fail for various reasons (e.g., financial resources, technical expertise, political majorities, etc.), this study explores the role of stakeholder involvement from the perspective of public agencies. The study addresses how the active involvement of stakeholders in the implementation process can contribute to the successful implementation of AI-based technologies in public labor and social administration. Specifically, we ask, under which conditions does the systematic integration of stakeholders, in the sense of a co-creative technology design process, help to overcome implementation deficits? To answer this question, we proceeded in three steps. First, building on the work of Krafft/Zweig (2019), we develop a refined risk matrix that applies to AI-based technologies in the public sector. The X-axis represents who is affected by an AI-based decision (individuals or collective actors). The Y-axis indicates whether the task, that is delegated to an AI, involves administrative discretion. Next, we propose different stakeholder involvement strategies depending on where a specific AI-based application is located in this novel risk matrix. Finally, we test our theoretical proposition by conducting a series of expert interviews with senior IT managers in the German labor and social administration, in the fields of AI-based employment services and child benefits (Federal Employment Agency) as well as AI-supported recourse proceedings and therapy management (insurance agency).",Carl Von Ossietzky Universität Oldenburg,Carl Von Ossietzky Universität Oldenburg,,,,,,,Carl Von Ossietzky Universität Oldenburg,,Markus Tepe,Mareike Winkler,,,,,,,Mareike Winkler,,Public Administration,Social Welfare,Welfare State,Qualitative,Technology,,,,Stakeholder Involvement in the Implementation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Public Agencies.

0,"Policy processes in education are shifting away from top-down structures towards horizontal interactions involving the coordination and cooperation amongst the key actors playing various roles in the organizational settings. Barriers in implementation of education policies include the coordination and cooperation challenges amongst stakeholders along with the pushback reactions against the reforms. Current linear governance systems are being challenged by pressures for more participatory policy processes. As participatory approaches become more commonly applied, policy makers use various methods to involve a range of stakeholders in the policy design and the implementation processes. This research explores the participatory approach to policymaking and implementation through application of Programmatic Action Framework (PAF) to the case about Vocational Education and Training (VET) system in the government of Azerbaijan, while primarily exploring the roles of actors in the process. The study also intends to identify the barriers and facilitators preventing and enabling this participation during VET policy implementation processes. As the study holds the qualitative research design with application of the case-study method, the possible challenge the author may face is the lack of motivation by institutional representatives to share main insights due to bureaucracy and confidentiality settings in place during semi-structured interviews.

0,"The interest group literature has focused primarily on the impact of lobbying stakeholders on national or supra-national policies. This has left a gap in understanding how stakeholder lobbying impacts policies at the sub-national level. This is particularly problematic in the realm of climate policy in the United States (US), since states have predominantly led the way on climate policy since failure of the 2009 Waxman-Markey bill, which would have established a nation-wide carbon pricing policy (CPP) program to internalize the cost of pollutants through a cap-and-trade (CaT) system. Such inactivity on the federal front, has opened space for states to take the lead on implementing sub-national CPPs themselves for the sake of climate change mitigation. 
 
This paper works to understand the interests and impacts of state-level lobbying stakeholders on sub-national CPPs in the US. It does this by conducting a case study analysis on Washington state’s CPP experience. From 2016-2021 Washington considered a series of different CPPs and each proposal was spearheaded by disparate actors. In 2021, Washington adopted a CaT system, called the Climate Commitment Act (CCA).
 
Through a qualitative analysis, largely based on interviews, this paper works to understand the interests and impacts of sub-national stakeholders on climate policy in the US. It does this by (1) mapping out the web of stakeholder interests for the CPPs considered in Washington, (2) considering how those interests changed overtime, and (3) measuring the relative preference attainment for stakeholders in the final CCA adopted.",University of Leuven,,,,,,,,University of Leuven,,Katrina Cano,,,,,,,,Katrina Cano,,Business,Methods,Agenda-Setting,Lobbying,,,,,Stakeholder Preferences and Success at the Sub-National Level,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64535&EventID=185
0,"During the 1980s and 1990s Britain underwent an economic transformation which saw many of its key nationalised industries privatised and opened up to competition. Network-based industries, in particular telecommunications, gas, water and electricity, presented particular challenges as these sectors had natural monopoly features, requiring the creation of a regulatory structure with the aim of protecting consumers from monopoly power. 

In 1983 a model of regulation was proposed by the economist Stephen Littlechild which later became known as price-cap, or incentive, regulation; this was subsequently applied to the water and energy sectors. This approach limits the prices that network companies can charge for their services, e.g. the price charged to an electricity generator for connecting to a transmission network. The idea behind this was that this would provide price stability, enabling investments to be made, whilst incentivising the company to operate their networks efficiently; as if they operated more efficiently than the regulator’s expectations they could retain cost savings as additional profits. One of the attractions of the model was that it eschewed what were seen as the negative aspects of US-style stakeholder-based regulation, which has historically involved protracted and highly legalistic regulatory hearings. US regulatory commissions have traditionally conducted ‘rate-of-return’ (RoR) regulation, through which a utility submits an investment proposal to a regulatory commission, which is then scrutinised, and if approved, is included in the ‘rate base’ on which investors earn a specified return (Joskow). In the British case, this RoR approach was deemed to be cumbersome and overly bureaucratic. The incentive approach, based on clear economic principles, it was thought, would be a simple affair which would cut down on bureaucracy and the need for extensive stakeholder dialogue.

However, over the past decade there has been somewhat of a sea change with regards to the role of stakeholders in the regulatory process. Since 2010 a concerted effort has been made in Britain to encourage and incentivise regulated companies to engage directly with their customers through a process known as customer engagement (CE). Given its increasing prominence in the regulatory framework for energy networks, the purpose of this paper is to take stock of customer engagement as a regulatory approach and to examine how various stakeholders involved in the regulatory process (the regulator, distribution companies, members of Customer Engagement Groups (CEGs) and sector analysts) have experienced it and judge its importance in future price control reviews. Through desk-based research and stakeholder interviews, we trace the introduction and evolution of CE within the regulatory framework for energy systems (focusing on gas and electricity distribution) from 2010 to 2020, and review how it has been perceived and implemented by the regulatory agency and the regulated network companies. 

Reflecting on the experience of CE, and drawing on a range of stakeholder perspectives, we identify several challenges and opportunities for CE going forward.",University of Edinburgh,,,,,,,,University of Edinburgh,,Helen Poulter,,,,,,,,Helen Poulter,,Interest Groups,Policy Implementation,Energy Policy,,,,,,Stakeholders and the ‘British Model’ of utility regulation,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64602&EventID=185
0,"The question of how good citizenship education can succeed is a hot topic not only in schools but also in extracurricular political education. In view of the threat to democracy posed by populist and (right-wing) extreme movements and parties and the increasing diversity in society, the state seems to be less and less successful in guaranteeing a common value base for its citizens and their integration. But how should such education be shaped in terms of content and through which forms can it be (effectively) introduced into society? Are state programmes for the formation of a ""suitable"" democratic citizen and a civil society that supports the political system desirable at all? Or would it be better - as the (specialist) sciences and professions demand - to strive for a political education that is as (state-)free as possible, the aim of which is to support (content-)open, critically reflective emancipation processes of the individual and society?
Interestingly, the most determined attempt at state-sponsored citizenship education in the non-school sector/ non-formal education can be found in Germany. Within the framework of special funding programmes of the federal government, corresponding content in political education for children and young people has been promoted here since the early 1990s. Since the 2015s, this area has experienced a massive expansion in the targeted groups and a considerable monetary and soon possibly even legally anchored upgrading, which is unprecedented within the EU. Conceptually, citizenship education measures currently focus primarily on (extremism) prevention approaches, anti-discrimination work, shaping diversity and promoting democracy.
Our paper proposal explores the tensions that arise in citizenship education between the state and citizens/civil society. After a brief outline of the history of special funding programmes, we discuss (1) the implications of different concepts of society and citizenship in prevention and anti-discrimination work/democracy promotion, (2) the advantages and disadvantages of short-term project funding versus permanent funding and (3) the role of evaluations as quality assurance, project development and potential state control. Finally, the potentials but also limitations of state funding for citizenship education for democracy and diversity are explored.

This paper traces the colonial genealogy of counterterrorism legislation in India and Egypt. By studying the entanglements of counterterrorism policies in the postcolonial present and colonial logics of governmentality, this article shows how legacies of colonialism produce similar logics of exceptionality in juridical norms across postcolonial contexts. This paper thereby aims to explore how we might think of the agency of postcolonial states when it comes to negotiating colonial logics in the realm of exceptional, emergency legislation and how statist notions of carceral ‘justice’ are negotiated in these moments. We conceptualise counterterrorism laws not only as a form of emergency politics but as modes of governing where dilemmas about the postcolonial nation-state’s negotiation with coloniality are staged.",OP Jindal Global University,Durham University,,,,,,,OP Jindal Global University,,Sagnik Dutta,Alice Finden,,,,,,,Sagnik Dutta,,Political Theory,Political Violence,Terrorism,,,,,,States of terror: Colonial legacies of counterterror laws in India and Egypt,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65560&EventID=185
0,"Who drives policy change? The common-sense and formal-institutional answer to this question is that the elected incumbents initiate policy change, ideally in line with the preferences of their voters or with the pledges made to them. In contrast, many interest group scholars hold that powerful groups can either prevent change or set the agenda for new policy initiatives. Drawing on elite interviews with approximately 300 interest group representatives from Germany, The Netherlands and the United Kingdom, we examine the empirical implications of these compet-ing hypotheses by comparing the party-interest-group-constellations pushing for change on poli-cy issues with those defending the policy status quo. We also take into account several alternative and mediating factors, such as public opinion (level of support, level of awareness), and other issue characteristics (scope, agenda status).  Our analysis shows that public policy is, in-deed, relatively resistant to change and that change is only likely when supported by a broad set of actors, including both government parties and a supporting coalition of interest groups.",University of Amsterdam,Universität Stuttgart,Kings College London,"Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey",University of Exeter,University of Amsterdam,,,University of Amsterdam,,Joost Berkhout,Patrick Bernhagen,Adam Chalmers,Beth Leech,Amy McKay,Patrick Statsch,,,Joost Berkhout,,Interest Groups,Political Parties,Agenda-Setting,Comparative Perspective,Lobbying,Policy Change,,,"Status quo bias in comparative perspective: Agenda-setting by interest groups and political parties in the United Kingdom, Germany and The Netherlands",https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65544&EventID=185
0,"Democratic backsliding is a gradual process of elected governments increasing their powers, and at the same time, undermining the check-and-balance institutions of liberal democracy. Remarkably, such executive aggrandizement is often pursued through formal legislative acts jeopardizing fundamental rules of democracy, which ensures the persistence of ‘illiberal practices’ beyond a single government term. The illiberal legislation is usually developed and enacted stepwise over a longer period of time, so its full scope may escape the attention of media, opposition and academic observers. In this paper, we seek to systematically track illiberal legislative acts initiated by consecutive governments in the context of Central and Eastern Europe (CEE), thus exploring the long-term evolution of such legislation. For that purpose, we first elaborate on the concept of illiberal legislation, by identifying the key arenas which may be targeted and devising a coding scheme to assess the degree of change compared to a status quo document. In the second step, we apply this concept to legislation initiated by Polish governments in the period between 2005 and 2019, which includes both minority and majority populist governments led by the Right and Justice party (PiS) as well as mainstream governments led by the Civic Platform (PO). The analysis uncovers the nuanced patterns of illiberal legislation both across time and with respect to the distinct dimensions of liberal democracy. The paper constitutes the first step in a larger comparative project which aims to map illiberal legislation across CEE, and explain its initiation and success in the legislative process.",Helmut-Schmidt-University/University of the Armed Forces Hamburg,Helmut-Schmidt-University/University of the Armed Forces Hamburg,,,,,,,Helmut-Schmidt-University/University of the Armed Forces Hamburg,,Marko Kukec,Florian Grotz,,,,,,,Marko Kukec,,Europe (Central and Eastern),Comparative Politics,Democracy,Executives,,,,,Steady Path to Dismantling Democracy?

0,"Although radical right parties have been around in most European countries for several decades, not only in parliament but also in manifold cases of coalition governments, findings about the radical right’s policy impact in Europe remain controversial (see contributions by R. Heinisch, M. Schain, T. Akkerman, M. Zobel and many others). Regarding Eastern Europe, only a few case studies explore the matter even though signs of such effects, if they occurred, were more visible here than in Western Europe as mainstream parties of the right and also the left were more willing to cooperate with radical right parties and embrace their agenda. The most obvious policy area impacted in the region has been the rights and treatment of ethnic and national minorities. The present paper takes a close look at six country cases in Eastern Europe (Bulgaria, Slovakia; Hungary, Poland; the Czech Republic and Estonia) to explore the impact of radical right parties on ethnic and national minorities’ rights, materializing as policy shifts on the national level. Building on the approach of an earlier study by the authors on the radical right’s impact on mainstream parties’ positions on ethnic and national minorities in the region (Minkenberg et al. in International Political Science Review 42(5), 2021), the paper applies an interaction model between radical right and mainstream parties and develops it further to study policy-level developments. In particular, by reviewing archival material, the authors intend to assess legislative changes and executive action between 2000 and 2016 with regard to their putative results in restricting minority rights. The authors argue that right-ward shifts in the area of minority rights are more likely to occur if mainstream parties pursue a strategy of positive engagement toward the radical right (e.g. collaboration or cooptation), and do not uphold a cordon sanitaire. Once such shifts occur, restrictive measures are likely to prevail (the policy is ‘sticky’).

0,"How do states use strategic non-regulation in migration governance? Over the last decade, a wealth of critical migration scholarship has emerged on the ways in which forms of inaction – theorized as standoffishness or necropolitics – and forms of ambivalent action – conceptualized as uncertainty, indifference, ambiguity or informality – have characterized how states govern migration. However, this literature has remained relatively fragmented and scattered across geographical regions, disciplines, and units of analysis. To consolidate insights on the uses and misuses of inaction and ambivalence in migration governance, and to advance theory-building, this paper takes stock of the complementarities and tensions between the various conceptualizations of strategic non-regulation. Our paper combines a systematic literature review with original empirical material collected via in-person interviews and participant observation with government officials, high-level civil servants, UN representatives, NGO directors and employees, as well as individual refugees and asylum seekers in Egypt, Lebanon, Morocco, Tunisia, and Turkey between 2012 and 2017. By putting our own empirical work on the Middle East and North Africa region in dialogue with research on the variegated manifestations of strategic non-regulation of migration observed and theorized in other geographies, both across the Global South and North, we seek to advance three central debates on the political functionality of policy failure and implementation gaps, the interplay between state capacity and political will, and questions of agency and intentionality in non-regulation. Ultimately, our paper seeks to offers suggestions for a concerted research agenda on the drivers, dynamics and effects of strategic non-regulation in migration governance.","Departments of Political Science and Public Administration, Universiteit Leiden",Rice University,Radboud Universiteit Nijmegen,,,,,,"Departments of Political Science and Public Administration, Universiteit Leiden",,Katharina Natter,Kelsey Norman,Nora Stel,,,,,,Katharina Natter,,Immigration,Asylum,Comparative Perspective,Power,Policy-Making,Theoretical,,,Strategic Non-Regulation as Migration Governance,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64507&EventID=185
0,"Scientific evidence on societal challenges is rapidly increasing, but it is still underused by policy makers. This is manifested for example with the continuing biodiversity loss and unbalanced use of ecosystem services despite cumulating knowledge to justify and enact sustainable use of biodiversity in policy and practice. Various science-policy interfaces (SPI) operate to bridge the gap between knowledge and action. Currently dominating paradigm in science-policy interaction studies focuses on knowledge co-production and has advanced from so-called linear model of “speaking truth to power”, towards “making sense together”. Yet, knowledge co-production approaches focus often on short-term processes or project-based science-policy interactions. The objective of the present paper is to propose a novel concept of strategic science-policy interfacing to help to bridge the knowledge–action gap for sustainable use of biodiversity. Strategic science-policy interfacing takes a longer time, recognizes complexity of governance contexts, and can be summarized as “systemic design for tomorrow” considering policy makers not only as targets of dialogue but as co-designers of long-term strategies. Strategic interfacing is considered to take place at four interconnected levels: individual level, process or project level facilitated by SPIs (e.g. assessment process; process to answer policy makers’ requests), SPI organizational level, and at the level of science-policy landscape in a certain domain, like biodiversity. Furthermore, strategic science-policy interfacing needs to be designed in connection to the specific target it seeks to change. We find three persisting challenges why the knowledge–action gap is still persisting in the biodiversity field: 1) political priorities on other issues override action for biodiversity, 2) mismatch between knowledge supply and policy demand, and 3) a gap between policy agendas and their implementation in practice. This paper examines how three biodiversity-related science-policy interfaces have attempted to overcome these challenges: IPBES, Eklipse, and EU’s Science Service. It is found that IPBES aims to shape policy agendas by intergovernmental setting to develop stronger political priorities for biodiversity among national policy makers and at the global level. Eklipse seeks to create networks of networks and uses open calls to match knowledge users with best expertise and knowledge holders to address the specific knowledge demands in solving real-world problems. Strategic approach by Science Service seeks to support implementation of existing political commitment expressed in EU’s Biodiversity Strategy 2030 by providing evidence to support implementation and by providing scientific answers to pressing questions identified by policy actors. These strategies go beyond single processes of knowledge co-production, and the examined SPIs are also linked to longer time span strategies to close gaps in science-policy landscape working towards sustainable use of biodiversity. Recommendations for strategic science-policy interfacing include tailoring SPIs to catalyze specific kinds of policy change, to start strategic design already before formal establishment of an SPI, to try to anticipate future policy developments, and to seek synergies and coalitions to communicate shared vision for biodiversity. SPIs can benefit significantly from having general long-term strategy to catalyze policy impacts in biodiversity domain, but also to contribute to solving other societal problems by bridging knowledge – action gap.","University of Oulu, Finland",,,,,,,,"University of Oulu, Finland",,Simo Sarkki,,,,,,,,Simo Sarkki,,Environmental Policy,Governance,Institutions,Knowledge,Policy-Making,,,,Strategic science-policy interfacing to close the knowledge – action gap for sustainable use of biodiversity,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64248&EventID=185
0,"This paper proposes a conceptual framework for identifying and categorising strategies for controlling territory and populations in the aftermath of separatist wars. I argue that research on post-war environments should extend its focus beyond peacebuilding and spoiling activities and frameworks based on positive/negative peace and recognition/counter-recognition to include investigations of the strategies used by conflict actors to shape de facto territorial and demographic control – that is, how they create ‘facts on the ground’. To that end, I present a conceptual framework of control strategies used by states, separatists and other conflict actors that aims to more fully capture their range of post-war activities and to provide a conceptual toolkit necessary for theory development and empirical research on the aftermath of separatist wars and the formation and trajectory of post-war environments. Drawing on civil war research and the central importance of de facto control in armed conflict, my framework uses the core characteristics of territorial and demographic control as a basis to conceptualise and operationalise four categories of control strategies: territorial access and denial, territorial presence and absence, population location and composition, and population loyalty and compliance. I then apply this framework to the context of post-war environments and illustrate its value in making sense of what conflict actors do in the aftermath of separatist wars. To support the validity of the framework, I draw on comparative evidence from a wide range of separatist conflicts focusing primarily on the Caucasus, the Balkans, and eastern Europe. I conclude with suggestions for how to develop a full explanatory theory that must link strategy selection to actors’ objectives and the constraints and opportunities of the post-war environment.",University of Birmingham,,,,,,,,University of Birmingham,,Nicholas Barker,,,,,,,,Nicholas Barker,,Conflict,Nationalism,War,Peace,,,,,Strategies for Controlling Territory and Populations in the Aftermath of Separatist Wars: A Conceptual Framework,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63722&EventID=185
0,"Heteronormativity is rampant in the quantitative social sciences, including the political sciences. At the root is the fact that quantitative research has a claim on objectivity more than any other method of research – qualitative or theoretical. Even though most scientists are aware that full objectivity cannot be achieved, the attempt to create as much distance as possible between researcher and research subject by using standardized statistical research methods implicitly carries heavy claims on objectivity. Since most research continues to be conducted from a white, middle-class heterosexual male perspective, their view, questions, methods, and categories are clad in this claim to objectivity. The distance to the subject, which supposedly lends legitimacy and universality to the research, will always be from the researcher to the subject, which is examined, named, and defined as other from the researcher. As such, quantitative social science, in particular, has been central to the perpetuation of science from one perspective and thereby has been reproducing and strengthening the marginalization of diverse perspectives in the social sciences. Can the quantitative social sciences then contribute to queering the field if it is so integral to cementing heteronormativity? In this contribution, I propose ways in which this reconciliation can take place. The relationship between quantitative social science and queer theory is a complicated one, fraught with past and present conflict. This contribution invites a conversation about ways to repair this relationship and move forward in mutual trust toward queering the quantitative social sciences.",University of Cologne,,,,,,,,University of Cologne,,Mirjam Fischer,,,,,,,,Mirjam Fischer,,Methods,Qualitative Comparative Analysis,Qualitative,Quantitative,Mixed Methods,Survey Experiments,Survey Research,LGBTQI,Strategies for Queering Quantitative Social Science Research,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65148&EventID=185
0,"Compared to other political parties, ethnic parties do not mobilise the broader population of a country but rather focus on the specific interests of ethnic minorities. As such, they differ from other parties in terms of their manifestoes, their electoral support, and their mobilisation strategies (Gunther and Diamond 2003). Given their specific features, it is not surprising that in subnational elections, these parties operate to a larger extent primarily in areas inhabited by the ethnic minorities they represent.
According to the extant literature, the existence of more than one ethnic party in a country typically results in ethnic outbidding, i.e., adoption of more radical or even extreme positions of ethnic parties (Horowitz 1985; Zuber and Szöczik 2015). In other words, a competition for a numerically limited segment of minority voters motivates ethnic parties to stress their ethnic positions, what eventually polarises the intra-ethnic competition. While this behaviour is likely to appear in national politics, the question is how intra-ethnic partisan competition affects the local strategies of the respective ethnic parties. Based on previous findings, the local demographic context provides ethnic parties with various opportunities and also constraints as it allows ethnic outbidding to be an option in some areas while it makes it a tactical risk in others (Stroschein 2011).  
In this paper, we focus on the electoral strategies of ethnic parties in such an outbidding scenario. Our analysis covers Slovakia, a country with a traditionally strong Hungarian minority with a well developed political and partisan representation. Between 2009 and 2020, the country witnessed a rivalry of SMK - a previously dominating Hungarian party - and its splinter the party Bridge with a more moderate stance in ethnic issues. The paper aims to analyse the strategies of these two parties in three local elections. We use data from three local elections between 2012 and 2020 with more than 6,800 municipalities with competitive elections. 
The outcomes indicate that in areas with a dominance of the country’s ethnic minority, the likelihood of more radical ethnic party to participate in the elections is higher than the moderate ethnic party. Also, in towns where the ethnic minority is the local majority, a further increase of ethnic minority share produces rivalry of both ethnic parties rather than their cooperation. The results thus show that in the case of an intra-ethnic partisan competition, the local demographics substantially affects the electoral strategies adopted by the respective ethnic parties.",Masaryk University,Slovak Academy of Sciences,,,,,,,Masaryk University,,Peter Spáč,Jozef Zagrapan,,,,,,,Peter Spáč,,Elections,Ethnic Conflict,Nationalism,Political Parties,Quantitative,,,,Strategies of Ethnic Parties in Local Elections,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63692&EventID=185
0,"Street-level bureaucrats (SLBs), such as teachers, doctors, or the police force, are a group directly tasked with the implementation of the relevant government policies. Their work is crucial for the exact shape that policy ends up taking and, consequently, for citizens’ satisfaction. This becomes particularly important in a situation when policy changes significantly, as it does after populist parties come into power, especially when the government’s policies lead to democratic backsliding, as they did in Hungary and Poland in the 2010s. Given that SLBs’ attitudes are likely to affect the zeal with which they implement populist policies, it is important to know to what extent they support the government in power. Hence, this paper considers the support of SLBs for governments that presided over democratic backsliding and the extent to which the mean support is a function of selection into and out of working for the state. To do so, I first analyze data from the European Social Survey (ESS) 2008-2018 to investigate the differentials in support for governments among SLBs (compared to the general population) in countries that did and did not experience democratic backsliding. Then, to investigate selection, I zoom in on Poland and use the Polish Panel Survey (POLPAN) to consider the extent to which democratic backsliding has led to a turnover in street-level bureaucracy.",Kings College London,,,,,,,,Kings College London,,Barbara Piotrowska,,,,,,,,Barbara Piotrowska,,Democracy,Populism,Public Administration,,,,,,Street-level bureaucrats and democratic backsliding,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65099&EventID=185
0,"The presented paper provides a comparative assessment of school-based civic education in the Czech Republic and East and West Germany. It explores the faults and strengths as well of strategies and challenges in civic education at Czech and German secondary and grammar schools. 
The paper provides historical excurses to the development of Czech and German civic educational policies. Further, the analysis focuses on attitudes, perceptions and evaluations of civic learning from the key actors of the educational process. The paper also investigates how civic lessons at Czech and German schools approach to historical legacies of communism and Nazism and the other controversial issues. Finally, it offers practical recommendations for civic education actors and stakeholders.
The Czech Republic and Germany represent cases of the old and new democracies. German example provides a unique experience of a country divided for 40 years into two separate parts differing in the character of political regimes and political cultures. The new German federal states and former Czechoslovakia shared experiences of the communist regime and a process of democratic transition. In these contexts, civics played a role in post-communist democratic strengthening while in the former West Germany civic education was a tool of denazification and democracy building after the Second World War. Currently, Germany ranks among the countries with the most developed system of civic education worldwide. In contrast, the Czech Republic belongs among the new democracies with an underdeveloped and underfunded conception of civic education.
The research builds upon a complex methodology, which combines a qualitative approach with the analysis of policies and data from the international comparative programmes. The analysis draws upon a unique dataset of 60 interviews with university students conducted in former East and West Germany, and the Czech Republic.

0,"Democratic backsliding in EU member states induced countertrends of democratic resilience at the national and at the European level. This paper focuses on the European level by looking at the paradox relationship between backsliding and supranationalisation and its potential long-term effects on democratic resilience. 
Democratic backsliding at the national level has triggered an incremental institutional change process at EU level during the last decade. As we show in our qualitative study, this has resulted in a substantial supranationalisation of democracy protection, which manifests itself in two ways. First, democracy protection in the EU has been driven by the EU’s major supranational actors, namely the Commission, the Court of Justice and the Parliament. While the Commission – pressured by the Parliament – introduced new instruments to safeguard the rule of law and democracy at the national level, the Court of Justice through various rulings created a more robust legal basis for such action. Second, the resulting instruments have a supranational character as they all make the Commission the central actor in fighting the dismantling of the rule of law in the member states. As a result, we now see a degree of supranationalisation of democracy protection in the EU, which Treaty makers have traditionally refrained from. Ironically it was the Council’s passivity on rule of law and democracy issues (caused by internal divisions on the issue) that allowed the three supranational actors to drive the process of supranationalisation. 
This development reveals a striking paradox and raises questions about the potential long-term implications for democratic resilience: The more the Hungarian and Polish governments – i.e., those actors prominently stressing national sovereignty and opposing further transfers of competences to the supranational level – block rule of law-related decisions in the Council and European Council, the more they actually encourage supranationalisation and attempts at strengthening democratic resilience form above. As we discuss, it is questionable whether this provides a solid foundation for democratic resilience or an obstacle because it plays into the illiberal actors' hands, providing them with new arguments against the uncontrolled power of Brussels.",University of Leipzig,Europa-Universität Viadrina,,,,,,,Europa-Universität Viadrina,,Lisa Helene Anders,Sonja Priebus,,,,,,,Sonja Priebus,,Europe (Central and Eastern),Democracy,European Union,,,,,,Strengthening resilience from above?

0,"Citizenship has become one of the main objectives for European education systems. Therefore, it is expected that teachers are well prepared and equipped with the necessary knowledge, skills, and attitudes to act as role models and to engage students in democratic citizenship. However, many scholars have concerns about the limited and inconsistent immersion of future teachers in the field of citizenship during teacher training. Consequently, the following question is raised: to what extend are first year pre-service teachers of all grade levels and across all subjects (in primary and secondary schools) prepared and willing to (1) participate in a democratic society and (2) teach civic education ? To answer this question, a survey was administered among 1907 first-year pre-service teachers across 26 bachelor and masters’ teacher training programs in Flanders. Data was gathered in the period of September 21 until October 20 2022. The focus was placed on two clusters of civic competences: (1) personal competences teachers need to function well as citizens in a democratic society and to act as role models for their students and (2) professional competences that teachers deploy to effectively teach civic education. Multilevel analysis was applied on the dataset. Preliminary descriptive results  concerning the professional competences indicate that young pre-service teachers do find it important to cover topics such as the European Union, compliance with the law, structural inequalities, structural discrimination, etc. in their lessons. However, their sense of self-efficacy to develop and implement civic education courses appears to be rather low. This is in line with the results concerning the personal competences: students tend to feel unable to participate in a democratic society and their sense of political efficacy is weak. Although further analysis is required, these preliminary results suggest that teacher training programs should not only strengthen the professional, technical competences of future teachers; active participation in today’s society should also be fostered.  Suggestions for teacher training programs to do so, are provided. An important note here is that this research is the first part of a longitudinal study in which the development of the civic competences of pre-service and young in-service teachers is explored. The current study gives insights into the civic competences of future teachers who are at the very beginning of their teacher training program .",Catholic University of Leuven,,,,,,,,Catholic University of Leuven,,Emilie Vandevelde,,,,,,,,Emilie Vandevelde,,Citizenship,Democracy,Education,Competence,Survey Research,,,,Student Teachers' Initial Personal and Professional Civic Competences and How They Interact,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65689&EventID=185

Yet, we have surprisingly little systematic empirical knowledge about how much influence these experts actually have on public policies. This gap can be ascribed both to theoretical issues and to a lack of methodological guidance. The paper presents a novel conceptual and methodological agenda for studying expert influence. It argues that the concept of expert influence offers a more robust basis for systematic research on experts and policy-making than existing notions such as knowledge utilization or evidence-informed policy-making. It then presents five methodological strategies for studying expert influence empirically: two existing approaches – process-tracing and surveys of attributed influence – and three novel strategies – analysis of preference attainment, text reuse analysis and citation analysis. The agenda is aimed at students of expert influence across a wide range of phenomena, including the influence of scientific experts on policy-making, the policy impact of expert advisory bodies, and the sway of national and international expert bureaucracies.","Departments of Political Science and Public Administration, Universiteit Leiden",,,,,,,,"Departments of Political Science and Public Administration, Universiteit Leiden",,Johan Christensen,,,,,,,,Johan Christensen,,Policy Analysis,Public Policy,Knowledge,Decision Making,Policy-Making,,,,Studying expert influence: a conceptual and methodological agenda,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64416&EventID=185

In the Nordic countries, there are long traditions for and democratic values attached to the dialogue between the government and civil society when developing policies for the educational sector.

The potential coherence between input by stakeholder groups and the quality measures proposed in the white paper is investigated. The theoretical framework comprises the concept of ‘uploading’ borrowed from research on EU policy making and discursive institutionalism to analyse the representation of input by stakeholder groups when they attempt to ‘upload’ their priorities into the white paper. The methodological approach is content analysis of the hearing responses and the white paper.

0,"Some works of literature might be read as insightful contributions to political theory. That is, literature might imply political theoretical positions even without explicitly addressing political issues; yet they are “discussing” the nature of politics. This paper investigates the meaning of sovereignty through some of the works by Herman Melville and László Krasznahorkai. Drawing on their works, the paper reconsiders how the Schmittian concept of sovereignty should be understood as the structural feature of genuine political action rather than as any substantial position. To discuss this topic, the presentation looks closely on the explicit and implicit intertextual relationships between the two literary author and the German scholar. Krasznahorkai’s admiration towards Melville is well-known and well-documented in his recent Spadework for a Palace and the related The Manhattan Project, however, political theoretical relevance and motives (Hobbesian allusions even) have already been present since The Melancholy of Resistance. In this latter work, the key figure is the carcass of a huge whale showcased by a company arriving to a city on the verge of order and disorder. In itself, the disembowelled body does not act yet its impact on the surrounding event and on the people allowed to take a walk inside its body is apparent in the story. The quasi-Hobbesian Leviathan in Krasznahorkai’s piece read through Melvilles’s Moby Dick reveals how sovereignty is necessary twofold; empty and stuffed (with people) at the same time. Furthermore, Schmitt’s indebtedness to Melville is also well-known and enlightening when it comes to his political theory. Through the novel Benito Cereno, Schmitt does not only describe his own position under the total state of his age but addresses the paradoxes of statehood in general as well. More importantly, the necessary indetermination of literary meanings might serve as an analogy to explain the Schmittian concept of the political. Thereby, moving beyond some thematic allusions between literary and political texts towards structural relationships between the two domains provides further layers to the discussion of the three authors. The paper aims at giving a parallel reading of literary and theoretical texts to account for the intersections of the political and the literary.",Centre for Social Sciences,,,,,,,,Centre for Social Sciences,,Attila Gyulai,,,,,,,,Attila Gyulai,,Political Theory,Realism,Theoretical,,,,,,"Stuffed and empty sovereigns: Krasznahorkai, Melville, and Schmitt in the belly of the Leviathan",https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65089&EventID=185
0,"Inter-parliamentarism and inter-parliamentary cooperation is often studied on inter- or supranational levels, introducing a variety of intermediate variables to the inquiries. Studying inter-parliamentarism within a national state and between regional or state parliaments enables research with a multitude of more or less constant variables, such as societal or language effects or a shared and well understood overarching political system. Yet, even within a nation state as Germany with 16 state parliaments, data collection of parliamentary proceedings is unstandardised and extremely labor intensive. Therefore, this paper introduces inter-parliamentary networks of MPs in social media as a proxy for inter-parliamentary cooperation.
Studying sub-national inter-parliamentarism seems to be a fruitful endeavour on many avenues and therefore mapping sub-national inter-parliamentary networks on Twitter is a useful task for descriptive statistics alone. However, this also brings up more structural and more quantifiable research questions, for example the role of capabilities and resources, touching on the question of division of labour within and between state parliaments.
This analysis presents a new data set of 1632 Twitter accounts by 3102 members of all German state parliaments and all tweets and retweets between these actors made in the year 2021. It presents extensive descriptive statistics delineating structural variables such as state or party effects, for macro and micro predictors respectively. Furthermore, an inferential network analysis is performed using temporal exponential random graph models. 
Several configurations of party and state effects are significant, yet it is also evident that the incorporation of additional variables would benefit the explanation. Nonetheless is the presented model a suitable base model for further research endeavours. 
Studying sub-national inter-parliamentarism informs future work on inter-parliamentarism in more conventional contexts, since structural effects are more prominent due to the aforementioned constants. It provides a solid fundament for work on multilevel parliamentary cooperation and furthers our understanding of parliamentary networks in more societal settings.

0,"Subjective group-based relative deprivation (SGRD) has evolved into a powerful means for capturing socio-economic grievances and resentment as it brings together cognitive evaluations and affective reactions thereto. Subjective perceptions of societal inequality and group-based disadvantage compared to relevant others have been shown to promote political protest behavior as well as populist and/or nationalist attitudes. Missing in this research, however, is if such perceived inequalities alter views on different modes of government altogether. Yet, it is vital to answer such questions to fully grasp the extent to which perceptions of inequality and socio-economic grievances shape societies. Thus, our paper studies if SGRD may explain preferences for authoritarian as compared to democratic regime types. Our theoretical argument posits that those perceiving their in-group as relatively deprived should be less likely to support democracy vis-à-vis authoritarian rule. Perceptions of being systematically disadvantaged may fuel disaffection with and resentment against the prevailing democratic system, whereas authoritarian systems appear appealing to individuals suffering from SGRD. Strongmen leadership or army rule promise a stronger protection of the in-group against this disadvantage and pursue more confrontational in-group-out-group relations that allow for channeling angry resentment. In accordance with social identity theory, authoritarian regime preferences offer a valid coping strategy presenting authoritarian rule as a remedy in the face of group-based status inferiority. To test this argument empirically, we rely on original survey data from six European countries (France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Switzerland and the United Kingdom) collected at two points in time (Nov 2020 – Jan 2021 and April - May 2021). Using regression analyses, we show that SGRD is positively related to the preference for an authoritarian regime type across all six countries at both points in time. Moreover, leveraging the fact that a group of the respondents were surveyed in both surveys, fixed effects regression models show that SGRD increases the preference for authoritarian regime types. In doing so, we contribute to scholarly literature in three important ways. First, we add on extant studies showing that perceptions of subjective disadvantage are crucial for explaining individuals’ attitudes. Thus, we provide an analysis of the influence of subjective perceptions of socio-economic grievances that expand on studies that rely on higher-level indicators of inequality to account for micro-level observations. Second, we combine literature from political psychology and political economy to provide an encompassing and interdisciplinary view on the consequences of group-based resentment for intergroup relations. Third, drawing on comparative panel data allows us to study shifts over time across several countries.",Universität Bern,Universität Bern,,,,,,,Universität Bern,,Maximilian Filsinger,Steffen Wamsler,,,,,,,Steffen Wamsler,,Democracy,Political Participation,Political Psychology,Comparative Perspective,Public Opinion,,,,Subjective Inequality and Regime Preferences: How Perceptions of Disadvantage Support Authoritarian Regime Preferences,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64700&EventID=185
0,"The paper addresses the field of subnational deliberative constitutionalism. It conceptually reflects on this yet understudied field of research that bridges deliberative democracy, the politics of public engagement in decision-making, and constitutional theory and practice. In its empirical part, it refers to examples of subnational constitution-making throughout Europe. In doing so, it adopts a broad definition of constitution and thus refers to plural decision-making processes in matters that are of fundamental importance for the respective subnational system. The paper highlights how processes of subnational constitution-making have been organized and carried out, and it identifies factors that had affected the processes, positively or negatively. Where relevant, special attention is paid to the working of participatory constitution-making in ethnic minority contexts, in the presence of institutionalized multilingualism. While very different in origin, procedure, and results, the case studies the paper refers to (in the main South Tyrol, Trentino and East Belgium) have two issues in common: First, they proceed from the contemporary crisis of representative decision-making processes or, more precisely, the crisis of legitimacy of the ‘infrastructural and procedural corset’ of contemporary decision-making processes.

0,"With the popularization of the notion of democracy in general and the spread of the concept of electoral or minimalist democracy, the number of regimes who based on fulfilling the basic requirement of holding regular elections can be attributed to the group of democracies has grown. Respectably, many populations surveys show that the share of citizens who express their nominal support for a democracy has essentially grown all over the world as well. But what exactly citizens mean when they say they support a democratic regime in their country? This paper employs the World Values Survey (2017-2021) and Eurasia Barometer (2021) survey data to examine the prevailing understandings of democracy in the countries of Post-Soviet Eurasia. The WVS has been offering to the respondents a set statements which describes how things can happen with respect to people’s rights, economic policies etc. Based on this module two indexes have been built. Index combining liberal notions of democracy defines democracy as civic freedoms that entitle people to a self-determined life and give them a voice and vote in politics. By contrast, illiberal notions of democracy combine autocratic elements which define democracy as obedience to the “guardianship” of rulers whose authority defies constitutional checks, public criticism and electoral contestation. This index also includes cases when democracy is strongly associated with the introduction and outcomes of economic welfare policies. Illiberal notions of democracy and high economic expectations have been grouped into category of “misperceptions of democracy”. Misperceptions of democracy are widespread in many post-Soviet countries. Why these misperceptions are dangerous? For many reasons, but foremost because authoritarian notions of democracy question the authenticity of liberal notions when both are endorsed conjointly. Moreover, the authoritarian notions reverse the meaning of support for democracy, indicating support for autocracy instead. Prevalence of misperceptions of democracy in the people’s mindset acts as a reinforcement of an authoritarian regime and makes autocratic elements in the country’s governance legitimate. High expectations from a democracy in terms of economic welfare are also dangerous and imply regime fragility when not civil liberties and the rule of law, but other outcomes, predominantly those related to people’s material wellbeing are seen desirable. Obtained findings are complimented by the analysis of Eurasia Barometer survey where respondents are presented with four questions designed to measure their understanding of democracy. For each question, respondents are asked to choose which of the four response items describing different definitions of democracy (freedom and liberty, norms and procedures, good governance, and social equality) most closely corresponds to their own understanding of democracy.",University of Vienna,,,,,,,,University of Vienna,,Kseniya Kizilova,,,,,,,,Kseniya Kizilova,,Democracy,Development,Transitional States,Comparative Perspective,Public Opinion,Survey Research,Political Cultures,,Support for Democracy and Understanding of Democracy in Post-Soviet Eurasia,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65644&EventID=185

The topic of this article is part of the current scholarly debate about the concept of “political support for democracy.”  The conceptual framework of this article is based on the concept of political support that was first formulated by David Easton (1975) and further developed by Pippa Norris (1999), Hans-Dieter Klingemann (1999), and Russell J. Dalton (2004), on the one hand, and the concept of a “realist” form of political support, presented by Richard Rose, William T. Mishler, and Christian W. Haerpfer (1998), on the other. One of the leading authors in this field is Russell J. Dalton, who focuses on political support for democracy in general and on political support for democracy in advanced industrial countries in particular (Dalton, 2004).

0,"When do individuals prefer coercive paternalism over its non-coercive alternative – nudges? Government paternalism refers to policies that intervene in the individuals’ private sphere and aim to prevent them from inflicting self-harm (as opposed to inflicting harm to others). Theorists and policymakers debate whether the government should use more or less coercive policy tools to promote desired social ends, especially those concerning the private sphere. Examples of such policies include tobacco, alcohol and sugar taxes, mandatory retirement saving, and anti-abortion laws. The global pandemic also highlighted this debate, which peaked recently over the introduction of vaccine mandates (e.g., in the U.S. and Austria). Indeed, coercive paternalistic policies are prevalent in contemporary public policy, although it is commonly considered that citizens prefer less coercion from their government, and therefore non-coercive policies should enjoy more support than coercive measures. 

In this experimental and comparative study, I examine to what extent and under what circumstances people are willing to accept government paternalism. Particularly, which of the two approaches to paternalism - coercive or non-coercive - do people prefer the government would use, given the choice? I developed a theoretical framework which seeks to explain public support for government paternalism based on the interaction between the coercion level and policy domain in question. Using an original online experiment administered in Israel the U.S., I test the effect of this interaction on public support. In line with my theoretical expectations, in both countries coercive policies dominate nudges in domains that relate to basic needs (e.g., safety and health), while non-coercive policies are generally preferred in domains such as welfare and morals. Whereas patterns of support are strikingly similar in these two countries which are very different from one another culturally, culture seems to shape the intensity of support. In both Israel and the U.S. the majority of respondents supports coercive paternalism, however Israelis’ support was much higher, especially for bans and mandates. The results suggest that culture sets the base level of support for paternalism, but the patterns of support may be generalized across cultures. Being the “hardest” in terms of support for paternalism, the U.S. case suggests that global support for coercive paternalism which promotes safety and health is potentially very broad.",Tel Aviv University,,,,,,,,Tel Aviv University,,Clareta Treger,,,,,,,,Clareta Treger,,Government,Public Policy,Comparative Perspective,Public Opinion,Survey Experiments,Political Cultures,,,"Support for government paternalism in a comparative perspective: Similar patterns, different intensity.",https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64708&EventID=185
0,"Survey vignette experiments have a fast-growing popularity in political science and local government studies. Scholars describe hypothetical scenarios and ask respondents to answer questions about, for example, what a local politician should do when facing a local government merger. Respondents are randomly assigned to treatment groups that receive different versions of the vignette. Researchers will often want to study scenarios that, for example, undergrad students cannot comprehend; they therefore want real-life professionals as respondents to ensure a high ecological validity of the experiment. This paper studies a methodological problem for survey vignette experiments, namely that professional respondents can have real-life experiences and preestablished attitudes that prevent them from treating the scenario as a hypothetical. As a result, their processing of facts in the survey vignette experiment becomes biased. 
A solution is to control for the respondents’ observed experience in analysing the material. This solution is not available if the researcher lacks relevant information about the respondents. Also, controls are often crude and can overlap with theoretically relevant variables. And in any experiments with participants randomly assigned to treatment groups, using controls is a contested practice. 
We ask how results from experiments are affected by professional respondents’ preestablished attitudes about- and past experience with a scenario described in a vignette. We use a split-ballot experiment to check if such biases are conditioned by whether the vignette is preceded in a survey by questions that evoke the respondent’s memories of their own experience with a similar situation. The research design thus utilizes question order bias, that is, respondents answering questions differently based on where they appear in a given questionnaire. 
The study context is a survey of Norwegian local government councillors. The survey was in the field just as many local governments had been involved in amalgamations. The survey contained several sections, with one containing questions about the councillor’s views on and personal experience with local government amalgamations and another containing a survey vignette experiment depicting a hypothetical scenario about whether one should overspend on local goods before a merger.
In a split-ballot experiment, the respondents were randomly split in two groups with one group receiving a version of the survey with the vignette first and questions about their views on and experience with municipal amalgamation second; the other group received a version with the reversed order. 
The results show, first, that the likelihood that councillors support pre-merger overspending is positively affected by their having recent amalgamation experience and a negative preestablished attitude to amalgamations. Second, the results are affected by the order of questions in a survey. The councillors attitude bias is significantly stronger if the vignette is located after survey items that remind respondents of their attitude to amalgamation, compared to the reverse order.",Universitetet i Oslo,"VIVE, The Danish Center for Social Science Research",,,,,,,Universitetet i Oslo,,Jostein Askim,Kurt Houlberg,,,,,,,Jostein Askim,,Local Government,Public Administration,Experimental Design,,,,,,Survey experiments and the shadow of professional respondents’ real-life experience: A split-ballot experiment on local politicians following local government amalgamation,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64301&EventID=185

0,"Recently, social movement studies  took a relational turn which investigates processes of mobilisation in view of the interaction between the three levels of analysis: the structural (macro), the meso (organizational), and the individual (micro) dynamics.
Research contributing to the puzzling repression-mobilisation nexus has focused extensively on the macro and meso levels of the analysis. In this respect, literature investigated whether repression enhances mobilisation or rather triggers demobilisation, how repression affects organizations, groups and movements, and how the latters adapt to the new structural changes/ their new context. The school of biographical consequences of activism introduced the micro dynamics of the effect of repression on mobilisation, focusing on the effects of significant experiences, particularly those of imprisonment, physical violence and torture on individual lives. However, these efforts remain focused on long term impact, or individual perceptions of macro changes. More crucially, when it comes to individual activists, the prevalent questions in existing literature focus on how repression affects individual activism and engagement and whether it triggers radicalization, in an implicit attempt to solve the repression-mobilisation dilemma.
What we aim to do in this paper is to shed light on the very experience of individual encounters with state repression. Based on extensive ethnographic fieldwork between 2013 and 2016, including observation, in-depth interviews and regular visits to the media outlets of the respective movements, the paper analyses the different effects of state driven repression on young activists adhering to a variety of political movements ranging from Islamist to liberal and leftist movements.
We make a simple claim: individual encounters with state repression occur differently. While repression is objective, its effect is individual and subjective. In other words, repressive events come to be considered as individual turning points based on primarily individual factors particularly emotional response, personal connection and subsequent choices.  Far from merely demonstrating difference, we take a step further in attempt to explain why individual trajectories take different turns, demonstrating how in each case a combination of organizational and configurational factors, along with individual properties (socialization, background, previous experiences) shape the experience of repression.",Philipps-Universität Marburg,European University Institute,,,,,,,European University Institute,,Nadia Aboushady,Farah Ramzy,,,,,,,Farah Ramzy,,Contentious Politics,Mobilisation,Narratives,Political Activism,Activism,,,,Surviving repression :  Trajectories of activists in post-2013 Egypt,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64258&EventID=185

As a recent coagulation of stances against extractivism and struggles for eco-social justice across Latin America, the Southern Ecosocial Pact along with problematizing consumer capitalism, is an invitation for (re)imagining alternatives from and with the Global South. In the era of Green New Deals, originating in the Global North, it calls for a socially conscious green transition benefiting the many. It is a stretch to discuss the claims of the Socio-Ecological Pact in terms of sustainability since what it does is precisely indicate the limits of the green pacts born in the global north and their focus on the “return to normalcy”. Contrary to the inter-generational focus of the hegemonic sustainability discourse, the proposal from Abya Yala brings into focus the current precarization of social and ecological life. Therefore, my paper, along with engaging with the vocabulary of the SEP, falls into the category of works at the intersection between critical sustainability studies and decolonial approaches. Recent discussions on Global South's contribution to the emergence of the SDGs (see Fukuda-Parr and Muchhala 2020), along with the long-lasting criticism towards the future-oriented and Anthropocenic vocabulary rooted in the language of the Bruntland Commission Report (Mebratu 1998; Baker 2005; Lozano 2008) raise important questions related to the promised ecotopia of Green New Deals.

The latter is closely related to changing consumption patterns in many countries, consumers are increasingly attentive to animal welfare and environmental and climate production. Related to this, food safety is an import aspect for many consumers. Governing the related transformation of production systems, remains a challenge for policymakers. Under what conditions are these demands successfully integrated in agricultural policymaking? And how can variation between countries be explained? In order to explore these questions, we select to policy areas that are especially relevant with regards to the sustainable transformation of food production and consumption and that are closely related to each other: animal welfare on farms and food safety. Both areas are currently receiving increasing scientific as well as political attention. Both policy areas are highly permeated by EU regulations, implementation and compliance however varies significantly between member states. Under what conditions member states are more likely to comply with EU demands or even go beyond EU requirements in the two policy areas is in the focus of our study. In order to identify explanatory variables, we conduct a Qualitative Comparative Analysis of food safety and farm animal welfare policymaking in the EU-15 member states. Explanatory conditions include public opinion, institutional conditions and party politics. Despite the close interlinkages between the two policy areas and their contribution to the sustainable transformation of food systems, farm animal welfare and food safety policymaking are mostly governed independently from each other.

0,"The study of democracy and democratic innovations has been marked in recent years by the recovery of systems thinking (e.g., Dryzek 2010, Mansbridge et al. 2012, Owen and Smith 2015, Elstub, Ercan, and Mendoça 2016; Warren 2017, Saward 2021). This turn has generated a raft of new empirical, conceptual and theoretical studies and broadened our understanding of democracy by shifting the emphasis from specific sites of politics to the ways they interact with one another. While this framework constitutes a productive development in the literature, the various systemic approaches also present a new set of theoretical and empirical issues. This survey paper proposes to take stock of this development by reviewing key contributions and identifying further areas of inquiry. We put forward at least four broad areas. First, we explore the normative foundations of systemic approaches to deliberative democracy and democratic theory and discuss how they might overlap, complement, or conflict with one another. Second, we ask whether these normative ideas might be considered sufficient for fulfilling a democratic or deliberative system or if we need to consider other conditions to support them (e.g., economic equality). Third, we reflect on the problems regarding the interactions between the components of a deliberative or democratic system (e.g., system boundaries, ecology of citizen participation, coupling). Finally, we discuss the relationship between theory and empirics by reviewing the challenges and opportunities associated with both the methodologies used so far and the questions necessary to operationalize a normative systemic framework.",Vrije Universiteit Brussel,University of British Columbia,,,,,,,Vrije Universiteit Brussel,,Julien Vrydagh,Afsoun Afsahi,,,,,,,Julien Vrydagh,,Democracy,Representation,Methods,Normative Theory,,,,,Systemic approaches to democracy: taking stock and looking forward,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64783&EventID=185
0,"Prior comparative analyses of 70 years of amalgamation reforms in Europe have been bounded by both time and space. Beginning the analysis of amalgamation reforms in the post-World War II years, the conventional explanation argues that amalgamation reforms occurred when countries engaged in decentralization reforms to develop Welfare State functions. We argue this conventional explanation ignores both historical events that took place before WWII and cross-country diffusion processes over the last 70 years. 

The paper employs a Comparative Historical Analysis approach to 1) identify historical patterns of amalgamation reforms in Europe and to 2) provide a macro-causal explanation to make sense of continuities and discontinuities in these reforms. We unpack four key elements of time required to investigate municipal amalgamations in a comparative manner: a) the historical time of adoption (enactment); b) the sequencing of reforms across countries; c) the tempo of the reforms (fast or radical vs. slow or incremental); and d) the duration of the reform (implementation).

In our search for a macro-causal explanation for amalgamation reforms we highlight the different historical time of amalgamation reforms, with some taking place almost two centuries ago (Portugal, 1835), others early after WWII (e.g. Sweden, 1948-52), others much later (e.g., Greece, 1999; Georgia 2002-2006), more than once (e.g., Denmark, 1960s and 2004-05), or never (Spain). Next, we employ the elements of physical time – sequencing, tempo and duration – to uncover the complex causal processes and patterns that generated these territorial reforms.",Research Center in Political Science (CICP) – UMinho/UÉvora,Research Center in Political Science (CICP) – UMinho/UÉvora,,,,,,,Research Center in Political Science (CICP) – UMinho/UÉvora,,Antonio Tavares,Pedro J.

0,"In 2019 the European Commission presented the Green Deal as it's pathbreaking
concept to realize the transformation towards a sustainable European economy.
For the agricultural sector, two accompanying strategies were presented: the
Farm to Fork (F2F) as well as the Biodiversity strategy. The overall goal of both
strategies is the creation of an European sustainable agri-food system. However,
the F2F strategy does not provide a consistent agricultural policy strategy, yet,
but rather focus on the implementation of the Green Deal's agricultural main
goals, which are de ned as the following technical production restrictions and
target values: (1) Reduction of mineral fertilizer use by 20%, (2) reduction of
pesticide use by 50%, (3) reduction of the N-balance surplus by 50%, (4) share of
ecological compensation conservation areas of at least 10%, (5) share of organic
farming of at least 25%. Evaluating the impact of the implementation of F2F-
strategy requires assessing its induced e ects on the relevant ecosystem services
(nitrogen-balance, biodiversity and CO2-emission) as well as the implied welfare
e ects for relevant socio-economic groups (farmers, agribusiness and consumers).
Beyond scienti c assessment the political feasibility of the implementation
of the F2F-strategy crucially depends on how relevant political actors, Euro-
pean government, stakeholders and voters anticipate e ects of F2F-measures.
This political assessment is rather complex, where political actors as economic
laymen form naive mental models on how di erent measures impact on relevant
policy outcomes. The latter correspond to subjective policy beliefs which are
formed via observational learning and informational lobbying as well as trans-
ported through framing. Hence, compared to scienti c results policy beliefs can
be biased, e.g. especially politicians of the Green party believe that ecological
farming signi cantly reduces nitrogen out ows as well as CO2 emissions of agri-
culture, while scienti c studies uniquely show that ecological farming is rather
ine ective in reducing GHG-emission as well as the nitrogen out ows. Accord-
ingly, it is important to align policy beliefs with scienti c results. In this regard,
a better understanding of how subjective policy beliefs are formed and updated
is crucial.
In this context this paper focuses on framing as the process of selecting some
aspects of a perceived reality that are given more importance than others in a
communication, where a frame is an organised unit for arguments and interpre-
tations. The question occurs, which frames are prevalent in the debate on F2F
1
and biodiversity and therefore might in uence the concrete implementation of
agricultural policies. Moreover, it would be interesting to identify whether cer-
tain interest groups use framing in public debates as a tool of outside lobbying.
A potential source of frames are online media. In particular, the use of social
media platforms can change political attitudes, so that  online socialisation 
plays an increasingly important role in political science analysis. Thereby, these
platforms mix the classical roles of sender and receiver and, as a network-capable
communication channel, facilitate the encounter with dissenting opinions. They
thus resemble digital  communication arenas  in which narratives on political
issues are exchanged. We therefore use data from the social network Twitter.
In particular, we apply quantitative text analysis methods to identify prevalent
frames regarding sustainable agriculture in the context of F2F. Moreover, we
analyse which frames are used by civic social organizations, agricultural interest
groups, political agents as well as private persons ( laymen ) in the debate.",University of Kiel,Universität Kiel,,,,,,,University of Kiel,,Michael Grunenberg,Christian Henning,,,,,,,Michael Grunenberg,,Environmental Policy,European Union,Green Politics,Empirical,,,,,Tales of sustainable agriculture: Exploring public's judgement of the European Farm to Fork strategy on Twitter,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64360&EventID=185
0,"Since Putnam’s (1988) seminal article on two-level games, EU scholars widely recognize that EU negotiations play out across multiple levels, and that citizen attention to the actions of their representatives at the EU level depends largely on the politicization of the issue at hand. Given this public attention deficit, the substantive actions of political leaders representing citizens during EU-level negotiations may deviate from what these leaders communicate to their constituents in domestic arenas. From a democratic and accountability perspective, what leaders communicate to their national constituents should reflect what their negotiators they do at the EU-level. Yet few studies have explored to what extent this is indeed the case: the literature on responsiveness generally looks either at concrete position-taking and how it relates to public opinion or the public legitimation of EU policy making and there still are significant knowledge gaps regarding the specific mechanisms that link public opinion to the policy positions of actors at the EU level. This project will analyse to what extent high political leaders’ communication at the domestic level reflects the positions forwarded by their negotiators during EU-level negotiations. We examine expectations derived from these two alternative perspectives by combining two novel data sets:  (1) a dataset with national positions in 40+ negotiations on EMU reform during 2010-2015 (Wasserfallen et al. 2019) and (2) a set of cognitive maps of publicly communicated policy ideas of national leaders during the same time (Van Esch et al. 2018). Using this data, we seek to establish the extent to which national leaders diverge from, or honour their public positions during EU negotiations and analyse the role that different economic and political conditions play in this.

0,"The European Parliament (EP) is the subject of numerous research works. The uniqueness of this type of parliament, as well as the magnitude of the impact its decisions have on the countries which constitute the European Union (EU), are elements which capture the attention of researchers in political science. However, several of the particularities which render the European Parliament so fascinating, such as the presence of multiple languages during plenary sessions, have also made broad analysis of its textual content more difficult. This causes researchers to have to focus their analysis on only a few countries, depending on their familiarity with the language, on policy documents, or on votes. This means we are passing by the goldmine of information which EP debates have to offer in researching political discourse and regional collaboration, to name a few. But what if we could systematically analyze the entire contents of all of the debates which have taken place in the EP?

The process by which this high-velocity database was put together is presented, as well as a descriptive overview of the contents of this data source, which is continuously updated on a daily basis.

Theoretically, the paper draws on crisis management literature and literature on crisis communication and how they link to public perceptions. Empirically, the paper examines the Covid-19 crisis as a particular case of administrative action in Germany. The transboundary character and scope of the Covid-19 pandemic allow observing a considerable variation of local crisis management in terms of effectiveness and crisis communication efforts.

0,"Bringing theory to life has always been the aim of educators. Teachers in all subjects and institutions struggle with the need to convey theoretic concepts to a varied group, hoping to foster curiosity and maintain interest.
We often search for didactic tools that may mediate between theory and its implementation. The need for such pedagogy is even greater with complex issues such as tax laws and policies. Teaching this subject matter requires a deep understanding of the values underlining each policy choice, the political and economic interests involved as well as the social, political and economic implications of these laws. Equipping students with this knowledge and understanding is our responsibility as teachers. Awareness of the purposes of tax laws and the values underlining them may improve their functioning as citizens and taxpayers. 
Tax laws involve highly technical aspects which may frustrate and even bore some of the students. 
For these reasons, an innovative pedagogy is required.
Our article shares a positive experience of using role-playing in tax law studies. The article describes experiences from Zefat Academic College School of Law in Israel:  an example of a roleplay illustrating universal challenges of tax avoidance faced by tax regimes globally due to of COVID-19. 
Tax payment is a major civil duty in a modern state. Broad tax avoidance undermines governance.
Tax obedience is affected by several factors, including the overall tax burden and the ratio between it and income; enforcement effectiveness; and taxpayers' understanding and identification with tax-paying importance. (Lesnik et al, 2014).
In times of severe economic crises, the temptation to avoid tax payments grows. It may emanate from financial difficulties taxpayers face, from taking advantage of the crisis or express protest against a government's manner of handling it.
In crises, tax authorities can avoid strict enforcement of tax laws. However, such reluctance could encourage ongoing tax avoidance. (Brondolo, 2009). Moreover, giving up tax enforcement in times of crisis is distortive, undermines equality, and harms the tax base establishment in the medium term.
Alternatively, the tax authorities can improve communication with taxpayers, demonstrate flexibility in terms of payments, relieves, etc., and focus enforcement in areas where disobedience implies the greatest risk to tax collection. 
The role play simulates in class this decision-making process, discussing the cases of three disobedient taxpayers, in different circumstances. The students represent the interest groups involved and affected by the policy, and role-play their negotiations and argumentation with the tax authority and in court.
The article describes the simulation, the considerations that led its initiators in its design and conduct, as well as the analysis of its didactic values (including fostering inter-disciplinarity, creativeness, integration of knowledge from other courses, working in diverse groups, policy advocacy, and more) in light of relevant literature.

0,"This paper is going to examine how local and regional governance is taught, using the subject of the UK as a case study.  The topic is particularly challenging because the UK does not have a standardised system of regional and local government.  Each of the four countries is different.  Added to that, the system in England is not uniform, and the concept of a 'regional' identity is not strong.

As a consequences, the teaching of this subject differs in each of the countries.  In Scotland, for example, priority is given to the Scottish Government over the Westminster Government.  Local government, in all systems, is sadly neglected.

A further complication is how to teach the systems of UK regional and local government to non-UK nationals, be it overseas students studying in the UK or teaching the subject matter overseas.

0,"The research on ruling technocrats is vast and mainly motivated by the basic assumption that their presence in government entails some kind of anomaly for democracies (Meynaud, 1964; Pastorella, 2016). In this vein, representative democracy have become strongly associated with the principles of party government, whereby executive offices are the golden target of political parties and the last point of the chain of delegation (Dalton, Farrell, & McAllister, 2011; Katz, 1986). From this perspective, non-partisan ministers should be considered a rare phenomenon (Strom, 2000). Therefore, the basic expectation in ministerial studies has been long-time to find cabinet portfolios occupied by partisan politicians (Laver & Shepsle, 1994). 
However, technocrats might not be such a novelty if we take a historical perspective, and its relationship with the quality of democracy could have less dramatic implications. In this vein, our paper aims to analyse the presence of technocrats in European governments since the First World War, and check which factors help to explain their evolution over time. Additionally, we would like to explore the effect of technocrats in the quality of democratic regimes.
The paper will employ data from the Who Governs dataset, including the proportion of non-political ministers in democratic cabinets since 1918, covering all countries of the continent. We combine this original dataset with information from the V-Dem project, in order to check the relationship between technocrats and the quality of democracy over time.

0,"The field of advanced therapies, which include cutting-edge techniques such as gene editing and cell therapy, has been recognized as one which imposes considerable challenges to regulators. This is so because these therapies bring about medical hopes to patients and clinicians fighting rare or resistant conditions, but are at the same time at an early stage of development and may trigger serious adverse reactions.
One example of these regulatory challenges comes from the domain of CAR-T cell therapies: products derived from gene editing techniques and aimed to fight resistant types of cancer. These products have proven satisfactory and efficacious in clinical trials and early medical treatments but to a considerable proportion of patients, they have caused dangerous reactions which may require long periods of intensive care. As this is a very recent therapeutic domain, the regulation of the treatment has evolved alongside the development of products.
In the UK, a clinical network has been formed to deliver CAR-T therapies. It is formed of hospitals able to sign off a strict accreditation process through which clinical competence and infrastructure readiness must be displayed. Currently, twelve hospitals have joined the network but a significant expansion is underway which will almost double the number of participating centres.
Because of the regulatory and governance difficulties posed by this initiative, NHS England, the body responsible for its coordination, has mobilised a range of requirements to steer operations in the network. Apart from the national regulations that apply to advanced therapies in the country, four groups of standards are paramount here. First, there are professional standards formulated by institutions such as the accreditation committee of the European Society for Bone and Marrow Transplantation. Second, there are industry standards elaborated by the companies manufacturing CAR-T products. Third, there are technical standards, which are created by bodies such as ISO and manage to have considerable global diffusion. Finally, there are some clinical standards created by medical and pharmacy staff engaged in the CAR-T network.
This proliferation of standards, as well as the interplay between standards and regulations in this domain, reveal important aspects of current technology regulatory governance. Some complex technologies emerge and are framed as a desirable societal and technological path. At the same time, the regulatory activity around them becomes fragmented, with a series of stakeholders formulating either de facto or de jure requirements. In these accelerated and fragmented scenarios, some markets can emerge and thrive while collective risks and liabilities are dealt with by means of specific contracts which are frequently kept as confidential.
In this way, the field of advanced therapies in general, and the UK CAR-T cell network more specifically, open a space for the analysis of key regulatory governance challenges pertaining to regulatory innovation, efficacy and public accountability.",University College London,University College London,,,,,,,University College London,,Edison Bicudo,Irina Brass,,,,,,,Edison Bicudo,,Governance,Public Policy,Regulation,Policy Implementation,Technology,,,,Technology governance and regulatory fragmentation in advanced therapies: the UK’s clinical network for CAR-T cell therapies targeting resistant cancers,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63377&EventID=185
0,"Political debate programmes go a long way back in German history. After the end of World War II, the Allies occupying Germany established the format to teach the Germans lessons in democratic values and debating culture. Nowadays, political talk shows can be watched on television daily, where a moderator discusses with a few guests like politicians, journalists, and civil society actors a previously agreed upon topic. However, dissatisfaction with the format is on the rise; the German Cultural Council recently recommended that televised political talk shows take a year-long hiatus to re-think their framing strategies, while the supervisory bodies of the public TV channels themselves offered scathing critiques of the increasingly sensationalist and ”populist” presentation of topics and character of the debates. Whereas it is widely accepted that private and tabloid media’s regular invocation of crises and their polarising black-and-white style of coverage is helpful for extremist political challengers, a potentially similar role of public media is generally less explored and especially when it comes to political talk shows. 

This chapter of my monographical PhD on the construction of political identities by the far-right party Alternative for Germany (AfD) builds on these critiques but also explores, from a discourse-theoretical perspective, the influence (or not) of televised political talk shows on the success of those constructions. To do so, I first ask if debates related to the bread-and-butter topics of the far-right such as migration, criminality, integration, or terrorism, are more frequent in number and more likely to be framed in overly exaggerated dooms-day terms than other topics. Illustrative titles of such debates are: ”Fear of refugees: reject, exclude, deport?” or ”New Germany - does toughness against migrants result in more security?”. This will be done via a content analysis of 291 talk shows as they were aired on public television networks ARD and ZDF, starting from the AfD’s turn towards a clearly nativist programme during the ”migration crisis” in the summer of 2015 until their breakthrough into the national parliament in the autumn of 2017.

Second, in a more qualitative way, I analyse via three full talk show debates how mainstream actors react to the challenges put forward by their far-right competitors and what strategies the latter use to make their claims seem natural, common-sensical, and having wide-spread support in the population. Additionally, I investigate how far-right political actors construct supposedly pre-existing identities in the electorate through representative claims such as ”we have to take the fears of Germans seriously” in the first place and how a sensationalist media coverage helps them formulate a perpetual cycle of perceived crises around security, values, and identity itself.",University of Essex,,,,,,,,University of Essex,,Julius Schneider,,,,,,,,Julius Schneider,,Media,National Identity,Populism,Constructivism,Identity,Immigration,Television,Political Ideology,"Televised Political Talk Shows and the Mainstreaming of Far-Right Viewpoints in German Times of ""Crisis""",https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65698&EventID=185
0,"Incivility, over-simplification, lying, and inaccessible language: there is widespread concern about the way politicians communicate. The underlying reasoning is that when politicians are dishonest, over-simplify matters, or insult each other, they violate widely shared communicative norms (Mutz, 2015). However, the widespread support for such norms among citizens is generally presupposed and we know surprisingly little about the norms individuals actually hold towards politicians' communication. Yet, a better understanding of the level and the variation in normative expectations towards politicians’ communication will allow us to better understand how individuals react to such communication.
We use novel Belgian survey data (2021, N=2030) to investigate differences in respect-based norms for mediated elite communication and their violations (e.g., incivility, over-simplification, dishonesty). Results reveal there is substantial variation in support for respect-based norms across the population, with notable differences based on socio-demographic characteristics (gender, age, education) and political attitudes (cynicism, populist, polarized attitudes). Moreover, we examine how individual levels of norm-support and perceived exposure to norm-violations relate to political tune-out (media avoidance and discussing politics) and legitimacy perceptions (political trust and candidate evaluations). While most people perceive that politicians do not play by the rules, not everyone adheres to these rules to the same extent and, as a result, not everyone reacts as strongly to rule-breaking.",University of Leuven,Universiteit Antwerpen,,University of Leuven,,,,,University of Leuven,,Emma Turkenburg,Ine Goovaerts,Victoria Vdovychenko,Sofie Marien,,,,,Emma Turkenburg,,,,,,,,,,"Tell me what you want, what you really, really want: Norm support for mediated political communication across citizens",https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=66416&EventID=185
0,"Since the introduction of the so-called New Public Management reforms, short-term personnel contracting has been extensively used by governments as a strategy to lower the costs of permanent public personnel, reduce bureaucratic burden and improve the efficiency of public services provision. However, In countries with weak and highly politicized bureaucracies, this type of personnel contracting may introduce rent-seeking incentives for political elites and negatively affect government performance. Overall, we know little about how the behavior of employees under a short-term contract differs from those of traditional tenured bureaucrats. Bringing together insights from human resources management and bureaucratic politics, I argue that the uncertainty over potential career rewards (re-contracting) and its interaction with patronage networks create incentives for temporary contractors to behave against the original purpose of the reform. Additionally, I explore how these two factors moderate the role of intrinsic motivation in temporary contractors’ performance. Using a survey experiment with public employees (N=350) from Colombia, I analyze how temporary contractors decide about their job effort and adjust their performance depending on their links to political patrons and the uncertainty of being re-contracted. I find that reducing the uncertainty of future career rewards improves performance. I also show that patronage might create substitution effects that either increase or reduce performance depending on job uncertainty levels. Finally, I find that patronage reduces the influence of intrinsic motivation as a driver of performance. These findings provide evidence against the usefulness of short-term contracting in developing public administrations.",Kings College London,,,,,,,,Kings College London,,Santiago Quintero,,,,,,,,Santiago Quintero,,Latin America,Public Administration,Public Choice,Decision Making,Experimental Design,,,,"Temporary Employment, Political Patronage, and Public Service Motivation:  An experiment on temporary contractors’ performance in patronage contexts",https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63711&EventID=185
0,"Twitter plays an important role in crisis communication in many countries. It is clear that influential accounts play a bridging role connecting the public and the government in times of crisis.
Previous research has measured user influence during crises using the PageRank algorithm. However, few studies have investigated the persistence of influence during lengthy crises. Research on the COVID crisis in Germany showed news organizations’ and journalists’ accounts to have been influential in all phases of the crisis, while government accounts were particularly important shortly before and after the lockdown (Shahi et al., 2021). If governments can identify accounts with long-term influence, then collaborating with those accounts’ owners could help to build a more stable and responsive communication system. In contrast, cases where accounts exert only temporary influence could be due to the content of specific posts; analyzing the content of such posts might suggest ways of avoiding misinformation.
This study aims to identify the continuity of influence of different categories of Japanese Twitter accounts during the early stage of COVID-19 (February to May, 2020). The categories and features of influential accounts were identified by retweet network analysis and text mining. Influential accounts are classified into five categories: “Business and Civil Society”, “Government”, “Media”, “Experts”, and “General Individuals”. Compared with ordinary users who speak from personal perspectives, influential accounts conduct significant discussions on “social level”, relating to the Japanese government’s pandemic prevention policies and medical responses, which usually present strong negative emotions. To investigate the persistency of influence held by influential accounts, a regression analysis model was constructed by using the number of times the accounts were defined as influencers throughout each stage of crisis communication as the independent variable. The predictive analysis aims to contribute to an appropriate definition of influential accounts in future crisis communication.
Since Japan was legally unable to enforce a lockdown, citizens were asked to adopt “self-restraint” measures. The government’s ambiguous and uncertain response policies provoked public discontent and undermined trust in government policies and announcements.

While analysts have made dire warnings about the dangers posed by returnees, little empirical research has analyzed whether they are a greater threat to national security than extremists who do not fight abroad. To address this need, we examine a supplement to the Profiles of Individual Radicalization in the United States (PIRUS) dataset that includes information on the travel and plot activities of 468 U.S. Islamist extremists from 1980-2016, including 57 who returned to the U.S. from foreign conflicts. Using mixed methods, we show that while returnees pose a moderate threat, individuals who do not travel or who are unsuccessful in their attempts to do so are more likely to carry out successful terrorist attacks in the U.S. Furthermore, our results suggest that terrorist plots can be the result of a displacement effect that occurs when security measures are put in place to prevent individuals from traveling to fight abroad. More specifically, during the period we reviewed, individuals who aspired to join foreign conflicts but were prevented from doing so had the highest rate of involvement in U.S. terrorism plots.",University of Maryland,,,,,,,,University of Maryland,,Gary LaFree,,,,,,,,Gary LaFree,,Extremism,Terrorism,USA,,,,,,"Terrorist Displacement: Foreign Fighter Returnees and Extremist Plots in the United States, 1980-2016",https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=62375&EventID=185
0,"The paper scrutinize whether democratic innovations present in party charters also appear in manifestos of respective parties, scrutinizing opposition parties in Hungary. It seeks to understand what factors enable congruence between parties' organizational build-up and their policies promoted to voters. Utilizing the theoretical framework of saliency approach, we argue that institutionalizing the same democratic innovations at the intra-party level and advocating for their adoption at the national level suggests higher importance, and signals `genuine commitment' for these policies. The study seeks understand what drives (possible) incongruence, analyzing links between electoral co-operation and organizational learning, as well as intra-party tensions and splits	 between 2010 and 2018. This longitudinal research design, analyzing democratic innovations in green, liberal, leftist and far-right parties, reveal a recent breakthrough of e-democracy 	in party manifestos, rather explained by fears of ballot secrecy violations than (slowly) changing internet penetration figures. Findings help us better understand the popularity of institutionalized democratic innovations, exploring distinct arenas where these are embraced by political parties. At the normative level, the analysis suggests that some forms of institutional solutions are better suited for intra-party organizations and more easily adopted by parties than national institutions.

0,"Because the multiple streams framework (MSF) was originally developed to explain agenda setting in democracies, it is unclear to what extent it can help explain policy processes in nondemocracies. In response, this paper tests key MSF hypotheses in a case study of China’s soil pollution law using qualitative content analysis and a dataset consisting of policy documents, newspaper articles, and secondary literature. Although China’s “cancer villages” received substantial attention in the 2000s and despite a government-mandated extensive survey of the scale and severity of soil pollution in 2010, the country’s first soil pollution law was only passed in 2018. This is surprising given that many other environmental laws were passed a decade earlier, indicating that there was political will to address environmental issues at that time. The case study examines these contrasting developments and identifies the driving forces behind the legislative process. This study is amongst the first to test MSF hypotheses in the context of China in a systematic way.

0,"How can busy judges decide cases more quickly? One strategy that judges can use is to reuse text from previous decisions. Text reuse could reflect over-worked judges and clerks cutting corners, sacrificing the quality of their legal reasoning for efficiency, but it could also reflect experienced judges appropriately using boilerplate text to make the process of decision-writing more efficient. In this paper, we examine patterns of text reuse at the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU). Using a new text corpus that includes the universe of CJEU decisions (1952-2021), we estimate sentence embeddings and calculate the similarity between sentences to identify verbatim and non-verbatim text reuse. We use quantitative text analysis techniques to assess whether reused text tends to be boilerplate text or text containing legal reasoning. We also compare patterns of text reuse to the Court’s case law citation network to determine when Judge-Rapporteurs are paraphrasing legal reasoning when citing precedent. We examine whether there is variation across Judge-Rapporteurs in patterns of text reuse to assess the degree to which text reuse is a practice used by particular judges (and their référendaires) or by the Court as a whole.",University of Gothenburg,University of Geneva,,,,,,,University of Gothenburg,,Michal Ovadek,Joshua Fjelstul,,,,,,,Michal Ovadek,,European Union,Courts,Decision Making,,,,,,Text Reuse in Judicial Decision-Making: Cutting Corners or Leveraging Efficiency Gains?,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63208&EventID=185

0,"In this paper we draw on fieldwork in three Indian cities to demonstrate that clientelism imbues local politics with a distinct visual symbolism. While the large literature on clientelism pays considerable attention to the ways in which voters, brokers, and politicians organize the exchange of material benefits for electoral support, it rarely discusses the visual symbolism generated by such electoral strategies. On the other hand, a smaller literature on the visuality of politics has not been extended to interpreting clientelistic politics. In this article we bridge these two literatures by unearthing the visual symbolism of everyday local politics in India. We argue that clientelistic electoral strategies require politicians to engage in a particular form of self-presentation, which revolve around the need to convey a willingness and capacity to provide voters with a particularistic access to state resources. We identify three dimensions of such politics: network visualization, credit claiming, and support-base visualization. We use ethnographic illustrations to show how politicians and their brokers convey the strength of their networks, their proven effectiveness in providing access to state resources, and their command over groups of voters. These aspects of local politics are not particular cultural idiosyncrasies of Indian politics but are instead strategic and common responses to the challenges posed by clientelistic electioneering.",University of Amsterdam,American University,,,,,,,University of Amsterdam,,Ward Berenschot,Adam Auerbach,,,,,,,Ward Berenschot,,Asia,Comparative Politics,Developing World Politics,Political Sociology,Post-Structuralism,Qualitative,Political Cultures,,The Aesthetics of Clientelism: The Visual Symbolism of Election Campaigns in Indonesia,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63214&EventID=185

External opportunities and related formal intra-party power constellations are seen to crucially influence RR party development. Yet surprisingly, in the German Alternative für Deutschland (AfD), the extremist grouping Der Flügel increasingly impacted the party even despite contextual normalization incentives and lower formal power resources. By analysing three critical conflicts within the AfD, we show how intra-party competition strategies can additionally play into RR party development. Flügel managed to balance contextual and formal power disadvantages by positioning itself as ‘the true party within the party’. Simultaneously, its discursive influence was crucially cemented by more powerful AfD leaders who used Flügel narratives against other established competitors for office.

0,"One of the primary foci of the Advocacy Coalition Framework (ACF) is policy change. Since the ACF’s inception, most studies of this phenomenon have been descriptive, single-instance explorations that confirm one or more of ACF’s four pathways of policy change: external shocks, internal shocks, negotiated agreements, and policy-oriented learning. This chapter shifts the focus to the antecedents of multiple, related policy changes within a policy subsystem to better understand the evolution of policies over time. To do this, we analyze 76 policy changes that occurred in the Colorado oil and gas policy subsystem from 2007 through 2021. We use public and government documents, news articles, social media, and interviews to identify the antecedents of each policy change and analyze how these changes influence one another simultaneously or subsequently. Our results identify the antecedents of policy change to include strategies for mitigating conflict, path dependencies on previous issues, and technocratic learning, in addition to the four pathways. These findings do not refute ACF’s current theoretical pathways of policy change; instead, they show the limitations of ACF’s current theoretical arguments and the need for greater contextualization to understand the drivers and effects of related policy changes.

0,"Political scientist and political pundits alike claim that liberal democracy is under threat by anti-plural political forces. Populists are generally perceived to be the primary culprits behind this democratic erosion (Rummens, 2017). However, more recently technocratic forces are also seen as a threat to liberal democracy (Caramani, 2017). On the one hand, results from supply side studies, for example, highlight that when populist parties are in power that they curtail the independence of the media and minority rights (Huber, 2017). On the other hand, little research has assessed the implications of technocratic governments for liberal democracies.
Turning to the demand side, things become even more complicated. First, studies demonstrate that individuals who are more populist are often more in favor of democracy, while it is not clear where they stand vis-à-vis liberal democracy (Zaslove et al 2021). Second, even though several studies have pointed to the prevalence of technocratic attitudes among citizens, little research has pointed to the relationship between the attitudes of the later vis-à-vis liberal democracy.
Using unique data from Great Britain, Germany, Spain, and Poland this paper assesses the relationship between individuals with anti-pluralist attitudes (both populist and technocratic) vis-à-vis liberal democracy.

Second, it examines the link between anti-pluralist attitudes and authoritarian values.

0,"Diaspora nationalism is a phenomenon which has political and societal implications for both the sending state and the receiving state. Nonetheless, the research focusing on the impact of policies on immigrant political incorporation and political opportunity structures (POS) established by receiving countries on diaspora nationalism remains limited. This study argues that if diaspora nationalism is to be fully understood, POS that have been developed in the receiving states have to be scrutinised. A crucial part of political opportunity structures for immigrant political incorporation is, indubiously, the efforts of political parties in the receiving country to increase the political participation of migrant-origin voters. Pons & Liegey (2019) call these efforts ‘voter outreach efforts.’ With an analysis of the campaigns and strategies of receiving country political parties based on the migrant-origin electorate and the perception of second-generation migrants with a Turkish background towards the political parties in the Netherlands and Germany, this study poses the question “what strategies do the political parties in Germany and the Netherlands employ in order to reach the migrant-origin electorate, and how do the ‘voter outreach efforts’ influence diaspora nationalism?” The strategies and campaigns of the political parties in both countries will be scrutinized through their manifestos and public statements.

0,"As governments across the world implement strategies to decarbonize their economies, the technologies on which they rely risk shifting the environmental and social liabilities of energy end-use applications from developed economies to the Global South. With electrification at the forefront of efforts to achieve these goals, one key technology—the battery—plays an outsize role in this shift. Even as investments in electric vehicles and battery electric storage systems help curb emissions of final products, key facets of the battery supply chain—from mining and processing of critical minerals to manufacturing, transport, and end-of-life management—emit large amounts of greenhouse gases, threaten water and soil health, and violate human rights.

Collective global efforts to reach the Paris Agreement goals have given rise to greater recognition of the political and economic risks of shifting emissions and unsustainable practices from one jurisdiction to another. Countries and regions with the highest growth in the manufacturing of lithium-ion batteries—the dominant battery technology for electric vehicles and grid energy storage—have made some efforts to clean up battery production. While Europe—projected to be the world’s second largest lithium-ion battery cell manufacturer after China by 2025—leads the way in policy and regulatory planning for sustainable battery manufacturing, the United States, China, Australia, Korea, and Japan have all made efforts to address sustainability concerns across battery supply chains critical to the clean energy transition.

A significant and growing body of research evaluates national policy and regulatory frameworks for economic decarbonization. Likewise, studies on decarbonization and sustainability in specific industries relevant to battery manufacturing—for example, mining, chemical processing, cell assembly, and recycling—evaluate sectoral policy and technical approaches in isolation. While existing literature provides a strong basis for assessing individual processes and policies related to battery supply chains, comprehensive evaluations of frameworks governing battery sustainability remain scarce. This paper aims to address this gap in the literature by defining key facets of battery sustainability, undertaking an empirical review of regulations in states with the highest expected growth in lithium-ion battery manufacturing between now and 2040, and incorporating stakeholder interviews on needed technological and policy innovation, with the ultimate goal of drawing conclusions on key drivers and impacts of state-led efforts to promote sustainable battery manufacturing.",Institute for Advanced Sustainability Studies (IASS),University of Eastern Finland,,,,,,,Institute for Advanced Sustainability Studies (IASS),,Emily Burlinghaus,Sirja-Leena Penttinen,,,,,,,Emily Burlinghaus,,Comparative Politics,Governance,Climate Change,Energy Policy,Policy-Making,,,,The battery rush and global supply chains: Regulatory pathways toward secure supplies of critical minerals in the EU and US,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65687&EventID=185
0,"Political solidarities are considered a normative cornerstone of modern civil societies and a key source of resilience towards anti-democratic threats. Despite its fundamental importance, little is known about the behavioural consequences of existing attitudinal solidarity measures. This study asks, how can we best measure political solidarities, i.e., the individual willingness to support public transfers in favour of others? Political psychology and sociology frequently aim to measure the multi-dimensional concept of political solidarity using survey items (e.g. WVS). However, experimental political science points to methodological shortcomings of attitudinal measures and highlights the benefits of incentivized behavioural measures to elicit social preferences. Following this critique, we implement the solidarity game by Selten & Ockenfeld (1998) using oTree and replicate their study design on a representative online access sample with real-time interaction. In the post-experimental survey, we collect a full range of attitudinal solidarity measures to explore the behavioural consequences of attitudinal measures on subjects’ behaviour in the solidarity game. The study enables us to identify robust measures of political solidarities that open new avenues for exploring the relationship between political solidarities, identities, and ideologies.",University of Duisburg-Essen,University of Duisburg-Essen,University of Duisburg-Essen,Carl Von Ossietzky Universität Oldenburg,,,,,University of Duisburg-Essen,,Achim Goerres,Jan Karem Höhne,Jakob Jonathan Kemper,Markus Tepe,,,,,Jakob Jonathan Kemper,,Methods,Experimental Design,Solidarity,,,,,,The behavioural consequences of political solidarities: Validating the solidarity game on a representative online sample with real-time interaction in oTree,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65996&EventID=185
0,"Social identities and group attitudes are important drivers for political behavior. Yet, despite growing interest into parties' strategic appeals to social groups, we know little about how such communication fits with a parties' more general campaign strategy on policy issues. The usage
of group appeals in combination with policy proposals provides parties with considerable leeway: they are relatively unconstrained to emphasize or downplay the consequences of certain policies and how they may vary across affected groups. Drawing on theories of issue
competition, we develop and test new theoretical arguments on the combined usage of policy and group appeals. We expect that parties generally have an incentive to underpin communication on their most advantageous issues with frequent appeals to social groups to
capitalize on group attitudes and social identity. Typically, parties will link groups associated with a specific issue. Yet, parties might also deliberately choose to provide links between issue A and group B to build on their existing strengths in one or both aspects. Thereby, parties
could try to further extend their competitive advantage in a particular policy area or switch the framing of unfavorable issues and groups – a typical example would be radical right parties linking immigrants to the economy or social welfare. To test these expectations, we combine

0,"This paper examines the implications of the Biden Administration Executive Order (EO) of July 2021 for public procurement in the United States.  The Biden EO emphasizes that the realization of the benefits of competition requires more than the application of antitrust laws.  The EO proposes a “Whole of Government” strategy that engages a broad collection of public agencies whose mandates encompass a wide range of policy domains.  The Whole of Government approach reflects an awareness that decisions taken by public agencies well beyond the federal antitrust enforcement agencies (the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission) shape the enabling environment in which business rivalry flourishes and the gains from competition fully emerge.

The paper studies the EO’s potential implications for public procurement in three parts.  It begins by identifying the EO’s central themes and its provisions that deal directly with public procurement. Among other features, the EO exhorts government departments to use the policy tools at their disposal to promote competition, and it urges agencies to work collectively to devise procompetition strategies. For example, among other agencies, the EO singles out the US Department of Defense as an institution that should consider how adjustments to its rules and practices might expand competitive purchasing options.

The second part of the paper provides a taxonomy of public policies that determine the intensity of competition in public procurement markets.  Prominent among these are public procurement statutes, regulations, and processes that determine eligibility to participate in public tendering and negotiated contract awards; decisions by procurement authorities to use expenditures to promote entry and expansion by new firms in market niches controlled by long-term legacy suppliers; antitrust, procurement, and anti-corruption measures that seek to detect and deter bid-rigging on public tenders; trade policies that limit entry by foreign suppliers into public procurement markets.  These and other government policies play decisive roles in shaping competition in public procurement.

The third section of the paper sets out specific steps that government officials can take to realize a Whole of Government competition policy for government procurement.  These include the expansion of efforts already underway to increase collaboration between antitrust, anticorruption, and public procurement authorities to detect illegal supplier collusion and to adjust procurement rules to expand the range of choices available to government purchasers; the replication of past success in using public procurement expenditures to promote new entry into public procurement markets; and the adjustment of trade policies that restrict foreign entry into the United States.

In addressing this topic, the authors build upon previous work that has underscored the importance of a multidisciplinary approach to solving competition problems frequently observed in a variety of economic markets, including public procurement.",University of Nottingham,George Washington University,European Bank for Reconstruction and Development,,,,,,George Washington University,,Robert Anderson,William Kovacic,Antonella Salgueiro,,,,,,William Kovacic,,Cartel,Trade,Corruption,,,,,,The Biden Administration Competition Policy Executive Order: A Whole of Government Program for Public Procurement in the United States,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65989&EventID=185
0,"This study explores what kind of epistemologies and knowledge claims that are perceived as legitimate within Swedish administrative courts. The judicial culture in Sweden is characterized by a strong commitment to rationality and detachment, hence, it is important for professional judges to keep themselves and their decision-making untouched by anything that resembles subjectivity and emotions. However, professional judges need to cooperate with and make decisions together with lay judges on a daily basis. In Sweden, lay judges are assigned by political parties and they can, under certain circumstances, overrule the professional judges, which make their non-judicial opinions and knowledge claims potentially influential. Consequently, professional judges use a variety of different informal techniques to control lay judges, among others, they set boundaries between objective and subjective forms of knowledge and experiences.
	Through interviews with both lay judges and professional judges, combined with and observations of interactions between judges and lay judges in court hearings, I analyze how professional judges exercise authority over them and how lay judges make sense of (and sometimes resist) this authority. One of the main conclusions is that professional judges perceive lay judges with similar ethnicity and experiences as the professional judges to possess objective knowledge, while lay judges with experiences of migrating to Sweden or of belonging to an ethnic or cultural minority group are perceived as subjective and, hence, as non-judicial. This study thereby contributes to critical race studies of law and legal practices by exploring how experiences of whiteness are tied to objectivity in the judicial sphere. The practical and societal implications of these findings are that racialized bodies, knowledges and experiences are delegitimized in the name of objectivity and judicial independence.",Stockholm University,,,,,,,,Stockholm University,,Livia Johannesson,,,,,,,,Livia Johannesson,,Public Administration,Knowledge,Courts,Decision Making,,,,,The Boundaries of Objectivity: How Professional Judges Construct Legitimate Knowledge in Relation to Lay Judges in Swedish Administrative Courts,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=62362&EventID=185
0,"This article analyses the case-law of the Brazilian Supreme Federal Court (STF) in relation to the policies for the prevention and treatment of Covid-19. Brazil is a country with high volume of litigation and the STF has been an important political actor since the 1990s. It would thus be expected that key decisions in relation to the public policies against the pandemic would be challenged or made by the STF. Moreover, there has been constant disagreements and disputes between the federal government and local state governments regarding the responses to the pandemic in Brazil. It is the role of the STF to resolve conflicts between central and local authorities. Lastly, the president of Brazil, Jair Bolsonaro, has refused to acknowledge the gravity of the pandemic and the importance of public health measures to control it. This increased the pressure on the STF to reduce the powers of the President or to oblige him to implement policies for preventing the aggravation of the health crisis. In sum, to understand the role of the STF during the Covid-19 pandemic is key for comprehending the governmental actions and omissions during this period. With the support of data science and artificial intelligence, the relevant STF decisions from Jan 2019 to Sep 2021 were systematically and exhaustively collected. These decisions were organized and classified into the following topics: social distancing, miscellaneous responses to Covid-19, face covering, requisition of private property, ICU beds, vaccination, and access to information. In total, 253 judgments were included for analysis.

The analysis of these decisions allow us to draw, with nuance and in detail, the following conclusions: an important share of the STF´s decisions were preliminary injunctions and made by a single Justice; the Court sought to protect the capacity of local governments to respond to the pandemic; some decisions show a critical attitude of the Court in relation to the federal government; in many cases there is an explicit overlap between the formal assessment of which federal entity (the federal government, state governments or municipal governments) has the authority to decide an issue and the substantive analysis of which policy should be implemented; and the STF has been hesitant to order complex measures for responding to the Covid-19 pandemic. These finding allow a better understanding of the possibilities and the limits of a Court to control a government that it (the Court) sees as incapable or unwilling to implement the necessary measures for tackling the pandemic.

0,"To date, coverage of data-driven campaigning has tended to focus on its negative consequences for democracy and has sparked numerous calls for platforms and policymakers to limit or ban this activity. Less attention has, however, been paid to the potential for (online) political microtargeting to enhance rather than undermine democracy. In our paper, we focus on the positive outcomes that can be advanced through political microtargeting. We argue, for instance, that targeting can be used to reach and inform citizens who are less engaged in politics or more likely to tune out from traditional media. Moreover, it provides a democratic linkage between politicians and the electorate. In the second half of the paper, we take a closer look at the conditions under which more positive endeavors of political targeting can be regarded as desirable from a citizen perspective. To put these claims into perspective, we will present data on public attitudes towards the use of different data sources for targeting to investigate the boundary conditions of targeting. Results indicate that all data should not be viewed as equal and that certain types of data are appropriate for advancing positive goals. The paper will offer more nuanced insights into the democratic role of targeting by moving the debate of targeting in a different light by focusing on its potential.",University of Manchester,University of Amsterdam,University of Sheffield,University of Manchester,University of Amsterdam,University of Vienna,,,University of Amsterdam,,Esmeralda V.

0,"Over recent years, increased emphasis has been placed on the importance of “place-based” approaches to policymaking in the UK, Europe, and the United States (cf. McCann, 2019; Beer et al., 2020; etc.). This agenda focuses on sub-national policymaking, within specific, identifiable cities, regions, and localities; and argues that, to be effective, various areas of policy (economic development in particular) ought to not only be informed by the particular needs and circumstances of particular places, but should also be designed and delivered by local leaders and communities too (Martin et al., 2021). 

Despite raising several important normative questions, the place-based policy agenda has, so far, received insufficient attention from political theorists. In this paper I rectify this, codifying a novel methodology within political theoretical research, “place-based political theory”, that directly contributes to the specific politics and policy of certain local places, and critiques the existing approaches and assumptions of place-based policymaking more broadly. 

I argue that place-based political theory should combine at least two strands of activity. Firstly, place-based political theory should represent a sub-category of “applied political theory” (e.g. McGrane and Hibbert, 2019), through which a political theorist develops and deploys the conceptual resources found within (ideal and non-ideal) political theory in order to better interpret, analyse and resolve normative questions of relevance to sub-national politics, policy, and governance. Obvious and immediate questions pertinent to the “place-based” policy agenda, I argue, include: (i) why and when should policy be made locally rather than nationally; (ii) how should local policymaking processes be organised and governed; and (iii) what particular policy programmes should places pursue? I identify several theoretical and philosophical resources through which such questions could be initially interrogated. 

Secondly, I argue that political theory can only be truly “place-based” if it is addressed from, as well as to, a particular, identifiable city, region, or locality. Building on the idea of the political theorist as “democratic underlabourer” (Swift and White, 2008) I explain how political theorists can (and do!) directly contribute to democratic processes and debates within the local communities of which they themselves are a part; helping their fellow citizens to make informed political choices by illuminating and critiquing particular problems, situations, or policy proposals of local consequence. This need not be a solely academic pursuit, with a variety of local actors – politicians, local government officers, journalists, activists, and citizens – also urged to engage in “place-based” normative analysis and critique of local policy. 

I conclude by summarising the key features, and benefits, of “place-based political theory” before outlining a forward-looking research agenda. “Place-based political theory”, I argue, is a mode of political theoretical research and analysis that offers an opportunity to both improve and invigorate local policymaking (by challenging accepted paradigms and agendas) and sharpen theoretical thinking and understanding (by providing a testbed for our conceptual ideas and arguments). It creates the potential for tangible impact within local communities, as well as deeper, critical analysis of the place-based policy agenda as currently conceived within policymaking communities.",University of Liverpool,,,,,,,,University of Liverpool,,James Hickson,,,,,,,,James Hickson,,Local Government,Political Theory,Methods,,,,,,The case for “place-based” political theory.,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64183&EventID=185

The aims of this article are twofold. Firstly, to produce and inventory of Swiss regional nature park policy objectives and their content. Secondly, to propose possible causes to why the divergences in the policy objectives between governance levels have been implemented. Policy objectives between the three governance levels diverge in topics. Using case study data to complement the comparative analysis, the divergences reveals two possible causes: (1) the parks create divergences to gain local acceptance, and (2) the divergences are easier to attain due to the term park.",University of Zurich,,,,,,,,University of Zurich,,Alix d'Agostino,,,,,,,,Alix d'Agostino,,Environmental Policy,Governance,Policy Analysis,,,,,,The cause of divergences in policy objectives between governance levels: A policy design approach to Swiss regional nature parks,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65853&EventID=185
0,"This study utilizes a mixed-methods approach to demonstrate the centrality of war for Russia’s media abroad. Linking organizational history, media performance, and big data, it emphasizes the challenges scholars face in conceptualizing this media as instruments of either ‘securitization’ or ‘information warfare.’ It draws from the organizational evolution of Russia Today (RT) and Sputnik, public statements by their editor-in-chief, and dissenting voices among former employees to evaluate the importance of Russia’s wars for these media outlets. Subsequently, the textual content of almost 1.8 million articles published between 2008 and 2021 is automatically analyzed to measure the dominance of Russia’s wars in their coverage. The results are evaluated for different languages and tested against the coverage of other topics. In the process, the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic is identified as a state of exception that defies the overall findings of the paper. Nevertheless, the results confirm that Russia’s wars in Georgia, Ukraine, and, to a lesser extent, Syria dominated the coverage by its media abroad from August 2008 to January 2020. Therefore, scholars must address the limitations and ambiguities of common conceptualizations to incorporate the centrality of Russia’s wars and acknowledge the perspective of their victims.",University of Tartu,,,,,,,,University of Tartu,,Anselm Schmidt,,,,,,,,Anselm Schmidt,,Europe (Central and Eastern),Media,War,Mixed Methods,Big Data,,,,"The Centrality of War for Russia’s Media abroad, 2008–2021",https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=62292&EventID=185
0,"The 2015 Paris Agreement established a bottom-up pledge and review process of national climate targets and actions, defined through regularly updated Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC). Similarly, the EU’s 2018 Regulation on the Governance of the Energy Union and Climate Action creates a process by which member states submit their National Energy & Climate Plans (NECP), which are then reviewed by the European Commission. Here we explore the inter-institutional relationship between the Commission and member states, and the extent to which this ostensibly collaborative process of increasing the ambition and implementation of climate policy is depoliticised or instead contested. The paper also asks whether this experimentalist governance framework has delivered on its ambitions of combining national flexibility, an embedded intergovernmentalism, with effectiveness in delivering the EU’s increasing collective energy and climate commitments. To assess the governance framework’s ability to close the gap between rising ambitions and implementation, the paper tracks the process of drafting and updating of NECPs – including interactions with the Commission and public consultations – in several ‘leader’ and ‘laggard’ countries, based on documentary analysis and expert interviews.

0,"This paper aims to discuss the potential role of the deliberative mini-public, a group of randomly selected citizens, in choosing the social discount rate (SDR). The SDR is used to convert costs and benefits occurring in different periods to present values, making it possible to compare them. In the context of climate-change policymaking, the SDR enables today’s society to weigh the costs and the future benefits from climate policies to mitigate climate change. 
A larger SDR means that future damages from global warming look smaller, which allows the current generation to make fewer emission reductions. Accordingly, the difference in the value of the SDR leads to significantly different policy recommendations. For instance, according to the recent estimation by William Nordhaus, the economically optimal climate path is to bring global emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) to a peak by around 2050 and achieve the decarbonization of the economy only in the next century if an SDR of about 5% is employed. On the other hand, the optimal climate path is to reduce global emissions of CO2 to net zero before 2050 if an SDR of around 1% is adopted. The latter climate path is compatible with the global temperature target of the Paris Agreement because, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the world needs to reach net-zero emissions of CO2 by around 2050 to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius compared to pre-industrial levels. 
How should the SDR be chosen? There are two main traditions for choosing it: the “prescriptive approach” and the “descriptive approach.” The prescriptive approach is that an SDR is selected while considering intergenerational equity. The prescriptive approach generally yields an SDR of around 1%. On the other hand, advocates of the descriptive approach set the SDR (nearly) equal to the market rate of return on capital because, according to them, the market rate of return reflects current people’s willingness to save for the future. The descriptive approach generally yields an SDR of around 5%. In this way, there is an (apparent) incompatibility between the prescriptive and descriptive approaches. Concerning the choice of the SDR, the prescriptive approach takes intergenerational equity into account, whereas the primary focus of the descriptive approach is to respond to the current generation’s preferences.
Against this background, I will propose a novel approach, which I will call the democratic approach, to choosing the SDR. The democratic approach is that the SDR is chosen in the deliberative mini-public, such as a citizens’ assembly. To justify the democratic approach, I will show that this approach is compatible with both prescriptive and descriptive approaches. To be more precise, I will demonstrate that mini-publics enable citizens to choose an SDR while considering intergenerational equity. Furthermore, I will argue that there is no good reason for advocates of the descriptive approach to refuse the use of mini-publics in choosing the SDR.",University of Zurich,,,,,,,,University of Zurich,,Masakazu Ogami,,,,,,,,Masakazu Ogami,,Democracy,Climate Change,Decision Making,Normative Theory,,,,,The Choice of the Social Discount Rate: A Democratic Approach,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63815&EventID=185
0,"Corporate actors play an important role in assembling the science underpinning EU risk regulation. They provide the initial information on which decisions are based, comment throughout the decision-making process, and litigate against decisions, which in their view have not duly considered the information and comments thus provided. While there are good reasons to involve private actors in regulation, concerns over undue influence on and epistemic capture of EU regulatory science by the regulated industry are growing.
Corporate actors exert epistemic power in both the administrative and the adjudicative phase of the regulatory cycle. Debates about regulatory capture, however, have tended to neglect the role of judicial review in either addressing or entrenching corporate actors’ epistemic power. Neither have debates on the role of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) in risk regulation directly engaged with the issue of capture. This is problematic, as the CJEU’s modern approach to risk regulation, entailing intensified judicial scrutiny over EU technical discretion, has developed in response to litigation brought and framed almost exclusively by the regulated industry.
In this paper we address this gap and examine the extent to which judicial review of risk regulation by the CJEU has addressed concerns over epistemic capture, when holding regulatory science to account for the epistemic quality of its advice. 
We combine doctrinal research over a decade of CJEU case-law with insights on expert accountability from political philosophy and comparative institutional analysis and juxtapose it with empirical studies on lobbying and interest group politics. We shed light on the ways in which the CJEU’s doctrinal approach has shaped the role of corporate actors as information providers, as well as the impact of this approach on their epistemic power in EU risk regulation.",University of Amsterdam,University of Amsterdam,,,,,,,University of Amsterdam,,Marta Morvillo,Maria Weimer,,,,,,,Marta Morvillo,,European Union,Regulation,Knowledge,,,,,,The CJEU and the epistemic power of corporate actors in EU risk regulation.

0,"Inequality has risen dramatically in the United States since the 1980s, especially at the top of the income distribution. At the same time, top marginal income tax rates and overall tax progressivity have fallen substantially. These marked trends coincided with a period of rapid technological change, which saw the US economic engine becoming increasingly powered by knowledge-intensive sectors. Has the rise of the knowledge economy reduced demand for taxing the rich? In this paper, we argue that citizens' support for taxing the rich varies depending on how economic elites earned their millions. In particular, we claim that the perception of the new generation of super-rich tech entrepreneurs as brilliant innovators and of great benefit to the national economy has reduced demands for redistributive taxation. We test this argument by carrying out two randomized online experiments of US Americans on Prolific Academic to explore how different forms of effort provision affect support for taxing the rich. First, we randomly create groups of workers and induce experimentally controlled situations of inequality in each group based on 1) luck, 2) traditional effort, and 3) complex knowledge-intensive skills. We then observe how a group of impartial spectators redistributes money between workers. Second, we run vignette experiments asking individuals about their preferred tax rate for a top income earner while randomly varying the earner’s profession.",Kings College London,,,,,,,,Kings College London,,Julian Limberg,,,,,,,,Julian Limberg,,Political Economy,Public Policy,Knowledge,,,,,,"The Climate Crisis, Policy Distraction and Support for Green Taxation",https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63850&EventID=185
0,"Much of the concern about affective polarization (that is, antipathy between supporters of opposing political camps) among commentators and academics alike stems from its alleged nefarious consequences for democracy and society. Affective polarization is often expected to reduce the cohesion of societies, erode tolerance and democratic norms among its citizens, limit the accountability of its leaders, and ultimately even pave the way to violence. We identify two knowledge gaps in the literature, which we aim to address in this study. First, the evidence regarding these downstream consequences of affective polarization is almost completely restricted to the United States. Secondly, most studies tend to be correlational, whereas other designs are need to firmly establish whether such nefarious consequences are actual consequences of (rather than just correlates of) affective polarization.

In our pre-registered study, we collected data on affective polarization and its downstream political and nonpolitical consequences among ~2,000 respondents each in 9 countries: Brazil, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the United States. We are among the first to bring the study of the alleged consequences of affective polarization – which in our study includes social avoidance, political intolerance, support for political violence, support for elite transgression, the erosion of democratic norms, democratic dissatisfaction, and politicized factual perceptions – to contexts outside the Anglosphere. To increase causal leverage, we exposed part of our respondents to a stimulus that either exogenously heightens or weakens negative affect towards political outgroups. As a result, we can observe whether, among whom, and through which mechanisms affective polarization results in more severe consequences for society and democracy.

By conducting this study, we aim to contribute to a better understanding of the extent of escalated polarization around the world – and, by extension, of the question how worrying a phenomenon affective polarization really is. In addition to unique empirical evidence from nine societies on different continents, we provide a theoretical framework integrating these possible downstream effects in a comparative perspective. Through these contributions, we hope to further the discussion on possible remedies against (excessive) polarization around the world.",Universitetet i Bergen,Mid-Sweden University,University of Amsterdam,University of Amsterdam,University of Gothenburg,Universitetet i Bergen,,,University of Amsterdam,,Lars Erik Berntzen,Stefan Dahlberg,Eelco Harteveld,Haylee Kelsall,Andrej Kokkonen,Jonas Linde,,,Eelco Harteveld,,Political Psychology,Political Violence,Comparative Perspective,Electoral Behaviour,Public Opinion,Survey Experiments,Survey Research,,The Consequences of Affective Polarization: A Survey Experiment in 9 Countries,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64713&EventID=185
0,"The EU is currently enticing high-skilled third country nationals to take up work in any of its Member States. This is done in various ways, by including relevant provisions in trade agreements, facilitating intra-corporate transfers, promoting the so-called Blue Card residence permit, as well as concluding Talent Partnerships with countries of origin. Its regulatory approaches towards high-skilled migration thus comprises international trade law, secondary EU law, as well as soft law instruments that are largely framed as development cooperation. 
The present article explores the constitutional conundrum underlying this specific mix, evaluating to what extent it may ultimately prove successful in attracting high-skilled migration and mobility. In doing so, it addresses the international legal boundaries the EU may not yet have sufficiently taken heed of, in particular the ILO Conventions 97 and 143 on migrant workers’ rights, and the UN Global Compact on Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration. Moving on from the macro- to the meso-level, we next inspect concurrent policies pursued at the national level, engaging in a case study of the Netherlands that digs into the (presumed) residual prerogatives of the Member States. Hereby, it is analysed to which extent forgotten bilateral treaties facilitating (high-skilled) migration, such as the 1956 Dutch American Friendship Treaty, or the even older UK-Dutch Trade and Shipping Treaty of 1837, may still be resorted to in light of current, new and imminent EU law obligations. Finally, in a more succinct inspection at micro-level, we proceed to trace to what extent litigating migrants or their prospective employers are hindered or enabled in the sphere of rights enforcement, especially considering the (non-)availability of direct effect.
The overall objectives of this research are threefold. Besides mapping the contemporary regulatory avenues relating to high-skilled migration, highlighting the constitutional dimension and the tensions between EU and national law in the process, we aim to draw attention to the obscure, sometimes even absent mechanisms of legal protection for businesses and migrant workers in this multi-faceted and multi-layered legislative landscape. The article is believed to offer scholars, policy-makers as well as practitioners and courts much food for thought, pointing out routes for improving (access to) rights for businesses and high-skilled migrant workers alike.",Radboud Universiteit Nijmegen,Radboud Universiteit Nijmegen,,,,,,,Radboud Universiteit Nijmegen,,Tesseltje de Lange,Henri de Waele,,,,,,,Tesseltje de Lange,,Elites,Globalisation,Migration,Business,Immigration,Trade,Europeanisation through Law,Policy Implementation,The Constitutional Conundrum of Trade Related Skilled Migration into the EU,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64590&EventID=185
0,"The use of evidence in policy-making and politics can take various forms and resorting to quantified knowledge in the form of indicators is one of them. In the past three decades, a plethora of indicator-based initiatives for assessing and monitoring progress towards sustainability have emerged at the international, national and local (e.g. urban) level. Indicators measuring progress towards the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals are a prominent addition to what critical observers referred to as an indicator “zoo” or “industry”. 
Despite this rapid growth of indicator initiatives and a more general trend towards quantification as a crucial mechanism in the production of knowledge for the governance of complex problems, empirical enquiries into the tensions and conflicts imbuing the construction of indicators measuring a value-laden and contested concept such as sustainability and their implications for urban governance efforts are few. 
Conceiving of sustainability indicators as boundary objects, this contribution puts the spotlight on the ways in which the (participatory) construction and use of indicators can stimulate debate and negotiations among divergent perspectives and ultimately contribute to strengthening policy coherence across fragmented policy fields. Relying on findings from qualitative interviews with public administration officers participating in the Swiss indicator platform “Cercle Indicateurs” and from a quantitative survey among representatives of Swiss cities administrations, this paper offers empirical insights into (i) tensions in the co-construction and harmonization of sustainability indicators for Swiss cities, (ii) policymakers’ perception of drivers and barriers for using sustainability indicators in their municipalities and (iii) the policy and polity contexts in which sustainability indicators are operated. Drawing a rich picture of actors, institutions and processes involved in the Swiss indicator landscape, these empirical findings will make both theoretical and practical contributions to recent debates on the quantification of knowledge for the governance of complex, interconnected and multi-level problems.",École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL),École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL),,,,,,,École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL),,Anne Boesch,Livia Fritz,,,,,,,Livia Fritz,,Governance,Local Government,Public Administration,Knowledge,Policy-Making,,,,The construction and use of indicators for sustainability governance: empirical insights from Swiss cities,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65908&EventID=185

Discussions on freedom focus on different aspects: the freedom of movement during a time of lockdowns, the freedom to access spaces without a QR-code, the freedom to make your own decisions with respect to taking the vaccine and to freely express your views on these matters on social media. The proposed paper explores how the value of freedom has become contested over time on Instagram during the course of the COVID-19 pandemic. The study carries out a manual content analysis of images on Instagram in six European countries (France, Germany, Italy, Spain, the UK, Poland). It analyzes not only how salient the conflict over freedom is, but also the form that this conflict takes, meaning the ways in which it is represented visually and how it is portrayed symbolically. The study links the findings to variations in the political-cultural contexts of these countries.

0,"Migrants’ play a significant role in European labour markets and are used as sources of “cheap labour”; often being disproportionately represented in low-wage, poor conditions, or otherwise precarious positions. Past research has suggested that the process of migrants being filtered into these low-end occupations is linked to institutional factors in receiving countries such as immigration policy, the welfare state and employment regulation. These institutional factors differ across countries with different migration histories, welfare state and production regimes, and interact to shape the and outcomes of migrants. This paper calculates the extent of migrant marginalization in 17 European countries using EU Labour Force Survey data, and then uses (fuzzy set) qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) to determine which combinations of institutional factors lead to high migrant marginalisation. The results show that when a country with restrictive immigration policy and a prominent low skills sector is combined with either strong employment protection legislation or a developed welfare state, migrants are highly marginalised on the labour market. The analysis concludes that migrants can be excluded from what are generally considered ""protective institutions"" - the welfare state and regulations that protect employees - when there is restrictive immigration policy that influences and effectively differentiates migrants' ability to avail of and benefit from them.",Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin,,,,,,,,Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin,,Sean King,,,,,,,,Sean King,,Institutions,Migration,Welfare State,Immigration,Qualitative Comparative Analysis,Comparative Perspective,,,The Contextual Cogs of “Migrant Jobs”: A Comparative Study of the Institutional Determinants of Migrant Marginalisation in European Labour Markets,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65016&EventID=185
0,"Citizen participation has long been a site of contestation (Arnstein, 1969, Susskind and Cruikshank, 1987).  Processes of urban and spatial development are exemplars of this pattern (Verloo and Davis, 2021).  Planning and implementation become sites of conflict as citizens, developers, NGOs, and businesses whose interests and priorities are at odds contend with each other to influence the shape and implementation of plans.  Similar patterns characterize domains as diverse as nature conservation and renewable energy development.  The organizations that represent the state have a complex role in these conflicts (Forester, 1987, 2017; Susskind, McKearnan, and Thomas-Larmer, 1999).  In some cases, they are a party to the conflict – pushing for particular priorities and actions. In other cases they serve as a kind of referee, helping to sort out the conflict and find a way forward.  The most complex cases confront state organizations with both sets of demands and the tensions they generate.

This picture captures many of the dynamics that drive policy conflict.  It emphasizes the role and influence of exogenous factors –competing needs, interests, and priorities – in the incidence and development of policy conflicts.  Upon closer inspection, however, contemporary policy conflicts reveal how these conflicts are also shaped by endogenous factors that are implicit in the processes that constitute and organize the participation of citizens and other stakeholders (Wolf and van Dooren, 2021; Laws and Forester (2015).  

This paper will explore the contributions that these endogenous influences make on the basis of an analysis of cases of renewable energy development, urban development, and nature conservation in the Netherlands.  The cases bring out the role that performative factors have in shaping how citizens and other stakeholders experience participation processes and respond to the opportunities and limits they encounter.  These factors range from positioning, recognition, and relational development to complex emotional responses that combine grief and anxiety with anger. They also reveal how citizens expectations about democratic process have changed and what develops when there is a mismatch between their expectations and the commitments that get expressed in the actions of government agencies.  Factors like trust become, in this view, not questions about organizations or individuals, but a feature of relationships that is always contingent, always in need of renewal, and always open to change.",University of Amsterdam,,,,,,,,University of Amsterdam,,David Laws,,,,,,,,David Laws,,Conflict,Political Participation,Policy-Making,,,,,,The Contribution of Endogenous Factors to Conflicts in Citizen Participation,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65014&EventID=185
0,"The Spanish transition to democracy is considered the paradigmatic case of successful democratization from above, in which the political elites lead a process that converted an authoritarian state into a liberal democracy. Despite the controversies opened in the last years regarding the legacy of the Spanish transition for the continuity of many Francoist political and economic elites during the democratic period, there has been no systematic study on to what extent Francoist elites remained in power nor on the factors explaining elite reproducibility under distinct regimes. In this paper, we present a new dataset to measure the renewal of elites in the Spanish transition called the ""Spanish Transition dataset.""

0,"More than two years after the beginning of the Covid-19 Pandemic we can already look at the way the political parties adapted themselves to the new conditions and especially how far were they able to cope with the necessity to live online. One of the possible ways to analyze such transformation is to focus on one of the most important moment of internal life for all the parties, i.e. their congresses (or conferences). On one hand such gatherings are the high point of the internal life and party democracy and on the other hand, they are also an important moment of self-presentation and medialization. If the context of the pandemic is well known all over the world, the ways parties reacted and still react to this new situation was and still is very different indeed and our assumption is that all in all the parties tried to avoid online congresses for different reasons. If the classical party congress is a way to meet, to gather and to socialize the elite, and to present the party externally (as a united, effective and meaningful collective actor) but even internally. The possibility to propose an online congress leads nevertheless to the limitation of these functions and implies the solving of some preliminary problems (technical and financial aspects, in some cases, considering the average age of the ranked members and delegates the digitalization should be a huge problem). If for some parties the switching into the online life was logical and ""natural"" (the Pirates, the Greens), some others did so under the constraint of the internal and electoral crisis (the Social Democrats), some were prepared to adapt (the Mayors) and some others preferred to wait and postpone the congress (ANO 2011, ODS, or the Christian-democrats), even if all of them implemented some relevant forms of digitalization and therefore an online congress was a possibility (or a necessity in case of lockdown extension).

0,"Deliberative democracy views discussion between lay citizens as a key component of a well-functioning democracy. However, previous studies suggest that variations in personality may have bearing on how people experience social interaction and respond to various stimuli. We contend that attention to personality might contribute to a better understanding of how people view and experience taking part in deliberative discussions. Our assumption is that certain personalities are better suited for deliberation than others are. This paper thus explores the relevance of the Big-Five personality traits in relation to public deliberation. It is thus expected, that personality traits might be relevant factors in explaining how participants in deliberative mini-publics, where social interaction is a central aspect, perceive the deliberation and how they are affected by it. The study is based on data from a Finnish experiment in citizen deliberation in 2014 (N=187) about the status of the Swedish minority language in Finland. We explore how personality traits as independent variables affect citizens’ preferences for taking part in deliberation as well as their subjective experience of the deliberation—i.e. how they regard their own role in the deliberation as well as how the view the group dynamic—when taking part themselves.

0,"In October of 2021, President Biden argued that the storming of the capitol nine months earlier “[had been] about white supremacy.” While the rioters of that day were made up of a mixture of Christian nationalists, QAnon supporters as well as a variety of other far right outfits, one of the concerns shared by these groups related to their declining status in society. Five years earlier, Donald Trump had already owed his successful nomination in large part to the support of racially resentful and ethnocentric white voters, illustrating the clout this group possessed within the party. Since then, their position appears to have strengthened as the significance of white identity has become a defining feature of Republican voters. Linked to this are anxieties about their own future place in a nation in which non-Hispanic whites will become a minority within the next quarter century. Polling during the Trump presidency, for example, indicated that an increasing share of Republicans now believes whites are subject to evermore discrimination, in their eyes sometimes even more extensive than what minorities have to contend with. 

These trends have coincided with a similar growth among (white) Republicans in the belief that political violence to protect the American way of life can be acceptable if not necessary. The proposed paper will assess the extent of the status anxiety present among white Republican voters, compare it to previous iterations of similar concerns, for example among white Southerners before and during the Civil Rights era as well as Christian conservative apprehensions throughout the 20th century while, moreover, assessing the potential for violence and a further dilution in democratic norms in the coming years. This will illustrate that fears related to demographic changes among white conservatives have become a cornerstone of the Republican Party and represent arguably the most dangerous threat to US democracy as the nation further diversifies",Institut für Politische Wissenschaft und Soziologie Rheinische Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universität Bonn,,,,,,,,Institut für Politische Wissenschaft und Soziologie Rheinische Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universität Bonn,,Philipp Adorf,,,,,,,,Philipp Adorf,,USA,Identity,Voting Behaviour,,,,,,The democratic consequences of demographic changes:  Status anxieties among white Republicans and their politicization for autocratic aims,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65912&EventID=185
0,"This paper examines the development of Donald’s Trump political style from 2016 onwards, based on speech analyses of Trump’s rallies before, during, and after his presidency. The analyses are executed with a method investigating populism as a political style in connection to elitism and pluralism. A conceptual analysis demonstrates the three concepts as closely related, even sharing one underlying semio-linguistic structure defining the meanings of the three relatively. This structure forms the core of a speech analysis model outlining all possible political styles as populist, pluralist, elitist, or a mixture of these. The analysis of Trump’s speeches with this method shows that Trump’s style was mainly populist (with some pluralist touches) during the presidential campaign in 2016. During his presidency, his style developed towards a mix of populism with elitism. The populist-elitist blend has the potential danger of encouraging undemocratic behavior, as it combines a belief in oneself as the best leader with the endorsement of the people who vote for you as the best people because they vote for you. This is a fallacy; moreover, it is principally anti-democratic, as promoting one people as better than other people is essentially at odds with democracy.

0,"As recent studies show, the proportion of volunteers in Germany has increased significantly in the last two decades. However, it is unclear to what extent this increase follows a general trend that includes all social subgroups. It is possible that this development is due to the partial activation of selected groups. This article explores this question by examining the occupational class-specific differences in voluntary work between 1991 and 2017. The analyses are based on data from the Socio-Economic Panel, which are representative of Germany. The empirical findings point to clear differences between the different occupational classes. The increase in recent decades is therefore due in particular to the increased commitment of highly-skilled, white-collar professionals, whereas the commitment of workers and service staff has changed significantly less over the years. Overall, this opens up a gap between these two large groups. The strength of this divergence is remarkable against the background of the social functions of volunteering. It is an expression of an increasing dominance of a privileged upper middle class, which can increase social capital through voluntary activities and bring class-specific interests into the political process.

It raised questions as to how best to handle moderation of hateful content in the online sphere, and sparked debate about the potential undesired effects on freedom of speech of the take-down approach commonly employed by social media sites. Counter speech and other types of pro-social bystander behaviors (E.g., reporting, counterarguing, ranking) present valuable alternative approaches to suspension. They rely on the reactions of online bystanders and enable the hateful content to remain available. These features are not only valuable as the crowd-sourced moderation enables broader reach; they also enable the hateful content to remain part of the debate, circumventing the issues raised by platform administered censorship, while mediating some of the negative impacts on onlookers caused by the hateful content. The jury is still out as to the potential, and magnitude, of positive effects affiliated with pro-social bystander reactions, yet this may not be the only pertinent issue facing this research agenda. Because what does a pro-social bystander reaction actually entail? What do such reactions look like (forms); what different functions are they intended to serve (types); and who is the communication aimed at (receiver)? In this paper, I dabble with the very conceptualization of pro-social bystander reactions, as I rethink the prevailing binary “takes place / does not take place” conceptualization. I do this in three steps. First, I review the existing literature for definitions and operationalizations of online bystander reactions – noting the many names this phenomenon goes by in the process. Second, I synthesize the existing conceptualizations and propose a new layered approach to thinking about online bystander reactions. Lastly, I discuss the implications of utilizing this non-binary understanding of bystander reactions to the study of, and fight against, online hate speech.",Aarhus Universitet,,,,,,,,Aarhus Universitet,,Tanja Hansen,,,,,,,,Tanja Hansen,,Cyber Politics,Extremism,Political Violence,Internet,Social Media,Communication,,,The Devil is in the Detail: Reconceptualizing Bystander Reactions to Online Hate Speech,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65072&EventID=185
0,"Populist radical parties on the right and left of the political spectrum are on the rise across Europe. What draws voters to these parties? We know that populist are united in their rejection of the political establishment, hostility towards globalization, and Euroscepticism. However, populism is, at best, a “thin” ideology, and right and left parties invoke populism in different ways in their attempt to marshal support away from integration and to capitalize on the frustrations of the “losers of globalization.”

Radical right parties combine populism with nativism, arguing that the EU’s open borders bring in unwanted immigrants. Hence, one assumes that populist right-wing voters opposed to European integration are drawn to the anti-immigration platforms of populist right parties, above all else. It is much less clear what kind of party cuing motivates populist left-wing voters. The “losers of globalization” hypothesis predicts that populist left voters should be more economically disadvantaged in the highly competitive single market, thereby opposing integration and voting for populist left parties based on the economic positioning of the parties. 

However, there is a host of unanswered questions within the “losers of globalization” theory as it relates to populist radical voters that this paper aims to explore. How do we explain the fact that some studies find that the representation gap between parties and voters is much greater for populist radical voters on both economic and immigration issues than between mainstream voters and parties? This is especially true for populist right voters. Similarly, studies show that economic voting is declining across Europe, and that individuals are more motivated by the transnationalist dimension of party politics. If this is the case, then what attracts populist left voters to Eurosceptic, left parties?

In other words, when a Eurosceptic individual casts a vote for a populist radical party, what conditions their decision to swing right versus left? Grounding our work in dealignment and party cuing theories, we explore this questions through a combination of individual-level data from the European Values Study (2017) and party-level data from the latest round of the Chapel Hill Expert Survey. We analyze the nature of the representation gap between populist radical parties and voters using a multilevel modeling approach across the EU member states. We hypothesize that what sets apart populist radical right from left voters, aside from their likelihood to vote for an anti-immigration party, is the cultural dimension of party competition. Populist radical right voters are more drawn to radical right parties that endorse moral conventionalism and law and order politics. At the same time, populist radical right voters are more likely to support alternative modes of governance to democratic representation, thereby posing a threat to liberal democratic norms.","Norwegian University of Science & Technology, Trondheim","Norwegian University of Science & Technology, Trondheim",,,,,,,"Norwegian University of Science & Technology, Trondheim",,Anna Brigevich,Hannah Richardsen,,,,,,,Anna Brigevich,,Cleavages,Comparative Politics,European Union,Globalisation,Political Parties,Populism,Electoral Behaviour,Euroscepticism,The Difference Between Us: The Representation Gap and Determinants of Populist Voting in the EU,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64660&EventID=185
0,"According to several observers, public bureaucracies are increasingly politicized as individuals with a party-political background are recruitment into leading positions in the public bureaucracy. Concerns regarding politicized recruitment include its potential for driving out competence, colouring the policy advice bureaucrats give to political executives, and negatively affecting the performance of public agencies. Despite a growing empirical literature and theoretical advances, we are only starting to understand the effects of politicized bureaucracies, especially in traditional meritocratic systems. In this paper we focus on the relationship between the appointment of top civil servants on the one hand and the input and output legitimacy of government on the other hand. How does the politicization of appointments affect input and output legitimacy, and are they affected in an equal manner? We hypothesize that input legitimacy (views on qualifications and the quality of policy advice) is more negatively affected by politicization than output legitimacy (views on responsive policy implementation). Next, is the effect of politicization of appointments conditioned by the appointee’s traditional merit qualifications? We hypothesize that negative effects on legitimacy are stronger if political appointees lack merit qualifications. Finally, do elite and citizen respondents perceive the dangers of politicization in the same way? We hypothesize that government elites (politicians and civil servants) have a more accommodating view of politicization than citizens and journalists. We test these hypotheses with unique data from a survey experiment with four groups of respondents in Norway: citizens, journalists, bureaucrats and politicians. The panel of citizens is based on a probability sample of the Norwegian population, the panel of politicians includes actors from national, regional and local level; the panel of bureaucrats includes ministry and agency officials; and the journalist panel includes respondents working for both national and local media outlets.

0,"Within the European Union (EU) and its member states, hydrogen is assumed to be key for decarbonising different sectors in the fight against climate change. Most notably, Germany has embarked on efforts aiming for a large-scale use of hydrogen. Hence, state and private actors in Germany and Europe have engaged in a variety of attempts, strategies and interest, specifically after the EU and Germany have announced specific hydrogen strategies recently. Against this backdrop, this paper seeks to provide an analysis on the debates generated by Europe´s bet on hydrogen, focusing specifically on Germany and the EU in the years 2019-2021. Drawing on a discourse analysis that is based on more than 32 000 media reports generated through the database Nexis for the discourse in Europe, and a specific analysis of German key media outlets, it analyses the debates on hydrogen in the European Union and one of its key member states from various perspectives and with a focus on a wide range of actors. The paper will specifically focus on debates emerging from the release of the hydrogen strategies of the EU and Germany. Building on a broad set of indicators, it puts an emphasis on discourses on the organisation, application, and opportunities of hydrogen as assigned by private and state actors and engages with debates on third partner countries, legislation processes, and strategic cooperation in the EU and Germany. It thus engages with the discursive practice of both the EU´s and Germany’s hydrogen approach in a complex environment with diverging interests of stakeholders, and thus examines debates that still need further empirical research. Preliminary findings suggest that a debate between blue and green hydrogen, technology openness, and an emphasis on third partner countries play an important role, while the transport and organisation of hydrogen constitute other discourses in which state actors, industrial actors, but increasingly also climate activists embark.",Johannes Gutenberg-Universität Mainz,Technische Universität Darmstadt,Johannes Gutenberg-Universität Mainz,,,,,,Johannes Gutenberg-Universität Mainz,Johannes Gutenberg-Universität Mainz,Friedrich Plank,Michele Knodt,Johannes Muntschick,,,,,,Johannes Muntschick,Friedrich Plank,European Union,Narratives,Energy,Energy Policy,,,,,The discursive practices on hydrogen in the European Union (EU) and Germany,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65653&EventID=185
0,"One of the purported causes of secessionism is prior statehood; stateless nations that were once independent states are more likely to seek independence in contemporary times. Indeed, the Scots, Catalans, Bugandans, and Acehnese, among others, have referenced prior statehood in their arguments for why they deserve independence. Yet no one has comprehensively examined whether prior statehood correlates with contemporary secessionism. Part of the problem is a lack of data on statehood in earlier periods. We investigate this relationship by bringing together two datasets: (1) The new International Systems Dataset (ISD) version 2, which identifies several hundred states in the 19th century; and (2) Griffiths’ data on contemporary secessionist movements. In a large-N analysis, we explore the relationship between the locations of prior states and the political ambitions of their descendant nations.",Syracuse University,,,,,,,,Syracuse University,,Ryan Griffiths,,,,,,,,Ryan Griffiths,,Conflict,Ethnic Conflict,International Relations,Nationalism,,,,,The Downstream Effects of Prior Statehood on Contemporary Secessionism,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=62203&EventID=185
0,"Private-sector labor intermediaries that connect migrants with employers play a key role in altering the global governance of labor migration. The brokers embed themselves in migrant social networks and utilize a mix of deep trust and money in altering patterns of movement, changing how migrants interact with the private-sector after arrival, and in encouraging migrant departure or change in statuses. Although the intermediaries were historically perceived as inherently working against the wishes of the State in moving labor across borders, they are now more than ever employing State resources in a way that helps them legally control how migrant labor is exploited by the private sector. Labor intermediaries are transnational in nature, yet the actors physically reside in a single jurisdiction and are accountable to local State institutions and civil society actors who influence how the brokers alter migrant experiences. While the governance of migration has historically been regarded as a key State function assigned to and held exclusively by the highest level of government, new trends regarding how private-sector migration intermediaries are regulated challenge this assumption. In particular, sub-federal governments and civil society organizations in select countries are increasingly licensing and regulating how private-sector labor brokers interact with migrants and employers; indirectly impacting all stages of the lifecycle of migration. 
This PhD dissertation therefore investigates to what extent private-sector labor intermediaries are increasingly being governed by a spectrum of institutions at the sub-national and local levels. In particular, I employ sub-national comparative methods to analyze how and why local State institutions and civil society organizations influence how migration brokers alter migration governance. This presentation will cover preliminary findings on how State and non-state institutions in Australia, Canada and the United States are currently regulating labor intermediaries in agriculture, in-home care and food processing, as well as what is causing policies of sub-federal governments to take the very different shapes they do. Findings for the first question illuminate the novel techniques that State institutions and civil society organizations have recently started using to alter their local migration infrastructures. I will discuss not only variation between the policy mechanisms used by different actors in different States, but important intra-country variation in how the actors are regulated as well. The result is a rich tapestry of migration governance that illuminates how the regulation of private-sector labor intermediaries greatly alters how a range of citizenship statuses are enjoyed. Answers to the second question explain how micro-level migrant agency, meso-level civil society institutions and trade associations as well as macro-level immigration schemes all interact to shape the collaboration between local governments and migration brokers. By examining how and why migration labor intermediaries are governed, we obtain a new understanding of how migration is regulated under multilevel governance, as well as grasp drivers of these policies in ways that previous studies at the national level may have missed.",Universität Tübingen,,,,,,,,Universität Tübingen,,Edward Mohr,,,,,,,,Edward Mohr,,Citizenship,Federalism,Migration,,,,,,The Dual Devolution of Migration Policy: Examining Local and Sub-Federal Regulations of Migration Brokers,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64473&EventID=185

More specifically, it explores how and to what effect the governance framework of single supervision and resolution in the EU bridges a potential gap between EBU- and non-EBU countries. Moreover, it will look into governance devices and institutional structures used to include authorities from non-EU countries. To that end, the coordination between multiple EBU, European and non-European supervisory and resolution authorities will be analysed.

0,"When do collective aims trump strategic interests when it comes to negotiating preferential trade agreements (PTAs)? The number of regional integration organisations vastly increased in the aftermath of the cold war. Moreover, an ever-growing number of states negotiate and sign PTAs with third parties as a single group, representing a common interest. While depth of integration clearly defines the political space in which states navigate, an increasing number of moderately integrated groups of states decide to jointly negotiate trade agreements, without any prejudice to member states' rights to negotiate bilateral agreements. For many states, this offers new opportunities as they face the choice whether to negotiate agreements individually or as part of a larger group.


This paper employs quantitative methods and network analysis in order to analyse (i) the political and economic benefits and costs of negotiating as a group as well as (ii) the conditions under which certain states decide to go alone, rather than being part of a (potential) coalition. Using multilevel-network models, the relevance of trade relationships and previous trade agreements both on international and regional level is scrutinized in a large-N analysis. This approach takes into account possible spill-over effects of agreements signed by single member states of regional IOs as well as network effects influencing the choices of potential accession candidates to IOs. A number of interviews with trade representatives and negotiators shed light on the rationale of the decision between individual and group negotiations.",University of Oxford,,,,,,,,University of Oxford,,Kenneth Stiller,,,,,,,,Kenneth Stiller,,International Relations,Political Economy,Negotiation,Trade,Empirical,,,,The Economic Diplomacy of Trade Blocs: Going Together or Alone?

0,"A key focus of polycentric governance theory is the existence and performance of interdependent policy forums in which actors participate, deliberate and make collective decisions about a certain policy issue. This depiction is useful but overlooks heterogeneity in actors and forums and its impact on forum and actor performance. Policy actors vary in terms of the organizations they belong to, the issues they care about, and their involvement in the system. Forums have different sizes and take place at different geographic scales. Moreover, not all policy forums in a polycentric system are deliberative: some forums focus on knowledge dissemination, others on allocation of resources or implementation. This paper analyses the effects of actor and forum heterogeneity on actor performance in a polycentric governance system using social network analysis and regression methods. It focuses on the empirical case of the governance of adaptation to sea level rise in the San Francisco Bay Area, using original data from a web-based survey (N=400 actors, 55 forums) carried out in 2018. Our key hypotheses are that actors perceive better own performance (measured as the impact that participation has on that actor’s goals) when they meet the same actors across different types of forums, and better forum performance when they take part in forums attended by actors similar to themselves.",Kings College London,,,,,,,,Kings College London,,Francesca Pia Vantaggiato,,,,,,,,Francesca Pia Vantaggiato,,Environmental Policy,Governance,Climate Change,,,,,,The effect of actor and forum heterogeneity on perceptions of performance in polycentric governance systems.,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63430&EventID=185
0,"If the literature on courts in competitive authoritarian regimes has typically viewed the judiciary as a mere window dressing tool or an instrument used by the incumbent to remain in power, empirical evidence from sub-Saharan Africa challenges this assumption. In the last four years, both the Malawian and Kenyan Supreme Courts have ruled against the incumbent and ordered a presidential election rerun. These sparks of judicial autonomy deserve greater scholarly attention. These instances strongly suggest that courts can play a fundamental role not only in consolidating authoritarian control but also, and importantly, democratic development. Hence, my paper aims at identifying the conditions under which judicial resistance occurs during electoral disputes in electoral autocracies. In other words, when – and to what effect - does the judiciary side with the opposition, and why? I argue that specific institutional configurations, inherited from colonial times, have shaped courts and given an advantage to the executive branch. In this paper, I investigate the effect of courts fragmentation on electoral cases outcome. I hypothesize that fragmented courts are more likely to support the ruling regime when adjudicated. To test my theory and exploit sources of institutional variation, I adopt a mixed-method approach that combines micro-level observational studies using original data and qualitative evidence gathered from archival work and semi-structured interviews conducted in Kenya and Senegal. My project has intellectual merit for several reasons. First, this project shows that courts in electoral autocracies are not epiphenomenal and have their own agency. Second, the project highlights the role of formal institutions in African politics. Thirdly, this dissertation project is the very first systematic data collection of court cases, within country, over time that relates to the sanctity of elections.

0,"How do citizens perceive different avenues for resolving investor-state disputes in case of an unfavorable decision? This article argues that citizens form legitimacy beliefs based on process and outcome-related considerations. On the one hand, a judgment against the host government of a foreign investor should decrease the confidence in the dispute resolution procedure among citizens in the respective country. On the other hand, I expect that appropriate design choices should boost legitimacy beliefs. I use a survey experiment with 3,917 respondents in Germany, France, and the United States to test these hypotheses. The experiment exposes respondents to a hypothetical investment dispute and manipulates the outcome of the dispute (home firm wins against foreign government vs. foreign firm wins against home government) and the type of dispute resolution mechanism used (arbitration, international investment court, domestic court). First, I find that a judgment against a person’s own country causes a decline in legitimacy beliefs – no matter which dispute resolution procedure is used. Second, the data shows that citizens accredit higher legitimacy to the international investment court and domestic courts compared to conventional investor-state arbitration. These findings indicate that utilitarian considerations (winning vs. losing) affect citizens’ perceptions of the investment treaty regime, but also suggest that institutional reforms, such as the establishment of a Multilateral Investment Court as promoted by the European Union, can help to regain public legitimacy.",Westfälische Wilhelms-Universität Münster,,,,,,,,Westfälische Wilhelms-Universität Münster,,Marius Dotzauer,,,,,,,,Marius Dotzauer,,Courts,Investment,Public Opinion,Survey Experiments,,,,,The effect of unfavorable decisions: Legitimacy beliefs towards different avenues for investor-state dispute resolution,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63860&EventID=185

These group-differences emerge when there are clear associations between social groups and specific parties. Recent work has shown that one way in which parties can create such linkages and strengthen the association between membership of a social group and electoral support is by means of group appeals. However, what we know about such appeals is mostly limited to the role of class-based appeals. By means of a series of vignette experiments embedded in surveys of British voters, we bring insights in the generalizability of symbolic group appeals for other types of societal groups. We test for the effectiveness of group-appeals based on class, rural/urban, education, age, gender and ethnic identities. We also examine whether effects are conditioned by respondents’ strength of identity and their perceptions deservingness.

0,"Traditional online comment boards suffer from significant communicative deficits, including informational cascades, scattered content, and low information-to-noise ratio. Recent events (e.g. Brexit, Trump campaign) have raised the profile of further distortions such as trolls, fake news and the polarization of online discourse. To address this, technologies that exploit argument visualization have been developed with the aim of improving the communicative quality of online interactions. In this paper, we explore the results of the Scholio project http://www.scholio.net/ that delivered a randomized controlled field experiment to over 1500 participants from across the world to test the feasibility and effects of adopting two argument visualization technologies to support quality discussion of online news. Pol.is combines user generated comments, survey responses, clustering of information, argument visualization and commenting. Deliberatorium takes a different approach, engaging participants in the construction of a structured argument map. Alongside the variations in platform, the experiment also tested an empathy inducing perspective taking treatment assigned at the group level and orthogonal to the platform treatments. Results indicate that, contrary to our hypotheses, neither the argument visualization platforms nor the empathy induction significantly reduced participants' reports of having negative feelings during the experiment. Deeper analysis indicates, however, that these effects are likely the result of participants' unfamiliarity with, and frustration about, the platforms. This suggests that developers of online commenting platforms that aim to reduce polarization and its negative consequences must remain cognizant of the limitations of complexity.",University of Connecticut,University of Southampton,University of Westminster,,,,,,University of Connecticut,,Michael Morrell,Paolo Spada,Graham Smith,,,,,,Michael Morrell,,Contentious Politics,Democracy,Media,Political Psychology,Field Experiments,,,,The Effects of Argument Visualization Platforms and Empathy Induction on Emotions in Online News Comments,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65483&EventID=185
0,"A recurring fundamental dilemma in liberal democracies is how to deal with radical and extreme actors. The dilemma concerns how to maintain these actors’ rights to democratic freedoms, while at the same time limiting adverse effects on minorities, the public, and state security. In an attempt to safeguard the latter, various hard and soft repressive measures have been implemented by both state and non-state actors, including bans, arrestations, surveillance, and public exclusion and stigma. Yet, to date, we lack coherent knowledge on the actual effects of such repression tactics in liberal democracies, exacerbated by most of the repression literature being confined to the context of authoritarian regimes. In order to narrow this gap in knowledge, this paper systematically reviews existing research that may inform our understanding about the effects of repression on political violence and militant mobilization in the context of liberal democracies. By exploring the importance of different repressors (state and civil society), types of repression (legal, physical and discursive), and the targets of repression (non-violent and violent actors), the article aims to identify systematic indicators of repression that may be used in future research to map its varieties and extent at the cross-national level. In addition, it identifies a set of causal mechanism that may help explain why certain repressive measures appear to escalate militancy and violence in some cases and de-escalation in others.",The Norwegian Police University College,Universitetet i Oslo,,,,,,,Universitetet i Oslo,,Jacob Ravndal,Madeleine Thorstensen,,,,,,,Madeleine Thorstensen,,Political Participation,Political Violence,Representation,Terrorism,,,,,The effects of repression on political violence: A literature review,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65526&EventID=185

0,"How does mass media cover social movement action in extraordinary times? I study the effects of Covid-19 by examining the environmental movements in the Global North and South. Using mixed methods, I find two effects: Rally-round-the-flag and indirect media blackout. I re-work and extend the “institutional mediation” model (Amenta et al. 2019) to better explain the decline in substantive media coverage of collective action during the early phases of the pandemic. The Rally-round-the-flag effect refers to the short-run increase in governments’ popular support during crises such as wars. Indirect media blackout refers to the idea that in these times, crisis-related news coverage crowds other issues out including movements in non-crisis related issues. To illustrate how these two conditions work against social movements, I focus on environmental policy- a policy area not directly related to the Covid-19 pandemic measures- in Brazil and Turkey.

Brazil and Turkey have already been dealing with concerns over democratic backsliding as well as with massive construction projects that triggered large-scale mobilization of environmental movements. Both governments took advantage of the public’s attention on the pandemic to execute their plans. Brazil’s environment minister was famously caught on tape saying: “We need to make an effort while we are in this calm moment in terms of press coverage because they are only talking about COVID, and push through and change all the rules and simplify norms.” To analyze the dynamics of coverage, I combine quantitative and qualitative analysis of one centre-left newspaper from each country: Folha and Cumhuriyet between March 10-December 31, 2021. Because of their editorial leaning, they are among the most likely venues to cover environmental movements. I triangulate the findings with 17 expert interviews I conducted with activists in both countries to understand their perceptions. I demonstrate that indirect media blackout and rally-round-the-flag effect restrained their plans for collective action. Furthermore, it has exacerbated activists’ perception of negative effects of online mobilization. I conclude with the rising concern over the increased class divide in social movement participation as a result of the usage of hybrid mobilization tactics due to the differential affordances of social groups.",Kadir Has University,,,,,,,,Kadir Has University,,Didem Türkoğlu,,,,,,,,Didem Türkoğlu,,Environmental Policy,Media,Social Movements,Climate Change,Comparative Perspective,Protests,Activism,,The Effects of the Rally-round-the-flag Effect and Indirect Media Blackout on Mobilization during the Pandemic,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65924&EventID=185
0,"Throughout Europe, populist parties –left-wing and especially right-wing (from now: LWPP and RWPP)– have persistently obtained good election results, which has culminated in these parties entering governments as coalition partners (e.g., in Austria, Italy, Spain, Norway) or as formal supporters of a minority government (e.g., Denmark, the Netherlands) (Albertazzi & McDonnell, 2010; Askim et al., 2021; Krause & Wagner, 2021). 

This has opened up a new research agenda on studies exploring the effects of incumbency records on electoral behavior (Akkerman & De Lange, 2012), effects of populist ruling on policies (Akkerman, 2012; Chueri, 2020; Paxton, 2021), ramifications for citizens’ attitudes, such as satisfaction with democracy (Harteveld et al., 2021; Muis et al., 2021) and consequences for the normalization and mainstreaming of populist parties (Askim et al., 2021; Mazzolini & Borriello, 2021). This study aims to add to this body of literature by systematically exploring how inclusion and exclusion of populist parties in/from government affects electoral support (i.e., the vote for the populist and mainstream parties, turnout and blank/invalid votes). More specifically, the key objective is to map the aggregate-level effects of including and excluding LWPPs and RWPPs in government (and minority governments supported by LWPPs and RWPPs), while studying this in relationship to country-level characteristics. 

I draw on evidence from a uniquely compiled comparative aggregate-level dataset covering governments in sixteen European countries for a 30-year period (Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Finland, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom) to shed light on these questions (1990-2021). These cases reflect variation by including various elections, covering countries where populist parties have either never ruled before, have formally supported a minority government or have joined a government as a coalition partner. This dataset combines data from official elections with data on government composition, election indices (vote shares, seats, turnout), and country-level variables (electoral system, fragmentation, prior incumbency, portfolios, type of populist party). This allows to study effects of including or excluding populist parties on patterns in electoral support. 

Populist parties have increasingly joined governments or supported a minority government. Preliminary findings indicate that this overall –with some exceptions— is associated with a net increase in support for populist parties (mainly for LWPPs) and a drop in electoral support for mainstream parties. Still, in countries with high vote shares for populist parties and where they are excluded from the government, non-inclusion is highly associated with significant loss in electoral support for mainstream parties that are ideologically close to the populist party as well. Finally, it seems that exclusion of populist parties that are electorally strong is associated with a drop in turnout at the next elections. We do see, however, that a set of country-level variables moderate this relationship. Hence, results point to a paradox as both including and excluding populist parties in/from government seems to harm mainstream parties’ electoral support, while populist parties electoral support bases remain quite stable.",Université Libre de Bruxelles,,,,,,,,Université Libre de Bruxelles,,Laura Jacobs,,,,,,,,Laura Jacobs,,Government,Political Parties,Populism,Representation,Voting,Coalition,,,The Electoral Ramifications of Including and Excluding Populist Parties in/from Government,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64394&EventID=185
0,"Within polycentric climate networks, different types of actors, such as businesses, NGOs, and faith groups, assume leadership positions that are independent of, but overlapping with, one another. In contrast to more top-down governance models, these nascent polycentric networks are highly complex systems, and are lacking empirical research. As a result, we do not yet understand fully how or why polycentric climate networks are developed, or even whether such networks facilitate more ambitious policy. More specifically, the empirical realities of two crucial types of nodes have been underexplored, namely ‘orchestrators’ and ‘inhibitors’. First, orchestrators govern indirectly to elevate climate ambition. Working with intermediaries, they employ incentives that are designed shape the behaviours of policy targets. Second, and in sharp contrast to orchestrators, not every actor in a polycentric network necessarily pursues greater climate ambition. Instead, inhibitors seek to obstruct, decelerate, or redirect others’ climate activities. Where do orchestrators and inhibitors come from, why do they assume these roles, and what shapes their impacts? In response, I analyse burgeoning polycentric climate networks . I examine the roles orchestrators and inhibitors play in shaping the levels of trust, the willingness to mutually adjust targets, and the capacity to conduct policy experiments, within local climate networks.

0,"Following the Paris Climate Accords of 2015, Côte d’Ivoire announced that it wanted to implement a carbon tax. Currently, the country is carrying out final studies to examine the potential of the tax and which sectors to include. However, scholars, as well as carbon pricing experts, have doubts about the fit of carbon taxation in the developmental context of Côte d’Ivoire as these policies mostly have been adopted in developed countries in the global north. Therefore, this paper analyses the agenda-setting phase to uncover how and why the idea of a carbon tax emerged and was put on the political agenda in Côte d’Ivoire. 

The analysis looks at domestic, regional, and international factors, as well as their interactions. While this research aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the agenda-setting process, the study puts specific emphasis on the role of capacity development. In developing countries, international actors often play an important role in policy-making through capacity development and financial support. When they are involved in capacity development projects, they can influence the direction and pace of policy change in the partner country through these projects. Therefore, taking these projects into account is necessary to fully explain the agenda-setting process. 

Based on policy diffusion theory, this paper aims to uncover whether learning is the mechanism at play, knowing that, traditionally, capacity development falls under learning. This research builds a theoretical framework based on interviews with Ivorian civil society, policymakers, regional and international organizations based in Abidjan, but is also inspired by policy diffusion and agenda-setting theory in order to explain the agenda-setting process of carbon pricing in Côte d’Ivoire. In a following study, the framework will be tested on Senegal, another country that is examining the adoption of a carbon tax. 

The study contributes to the literature on policy diffusion (learning), environmental governance, and capacity development in the West African country of Côte d’Ivoire. To my knowledge, this is a very understudied topic and therefore requires scholars’ attention in order to learn how environmental policy change unfolds in West African countries.",University of Leuven,,,,,,,,University of Leuven,,Charlotte Debeuf,,,,,,,,Charlotte Debeuf,,Africa,Environmental Policy,International Relations,Public Policy,Developing World Politics,Agenda-Setting,Policy Change,,The emergence of carbon pricing on the political agenda in Côte d’Ivoire,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65749&EventID=185

Drawing on a dataset of 544 ministers in France, Italy, Spain, Germany and United Kingdom, we select ministers in “key” positions to observe the new career paths of the ruling class. In this regard, the paper focuses on the ministries of the economic area (finance, economics, development) and those of the legal and security area (justice, interior, defense). Socio-demographic characteristics such as average age, gender and professional activities in which ministers are involved before and after their term of office will be taken into account. Taking note of the progressive elite interpenetration between politics and business – and on the basis of the loosing weight of both ideological and party ties – the paper underlines the progressive emergence of an extra-party political class that goes far beyond technocrats vs. politicians hallmark. In addition, the paper provides interesting insights on the ministerial instability and turnover in cabinet, thus stimulating further reflections on the efficiency and accountability of contemporary governments.","Dipartimento di Scienze Sociali, Università di Napoli Federico II","Dipartimento di Scienze Sociali, Università di Napoli Federico II",,,,,,,"Dipartimento di Scienze Sociali, Università di Napoli Federico II",,Annarita Criscitiello,Raffaella Fittipaldi,,,,,,,Annarita Criscitiello,,Comparative Politics,Democracy,Elites,European Politics,Government,,,,The emergence of the extra-party political class.

Building on the hypothesis that EU agencies bear a potential to transform the EU political-administrative order (as the functioning of the political system and the traditions in discharging public policies), this paper analyses the empowerment of agencies in the EU Area of Freedom, Security and Justice (AFSJ) to the benefit of an increasingly integrated administration and a Europeanized executive. Also in response to the migrant crisis and the rise of Islamist terrorist attacks in Europe, the enhanced mandate of Frontex, Easo and Europol (yielding more policy-steering potential and new executive, monitoring and steering functions) calls for a careful analysis of the emergent executive morphology of the AFSJ. While we witness an increasing ‘Europeanization of executive powers’ in the EU interiors, the pluralization of executive fora might at the same time fragment the ownership of executive powers, raising doubts with regards the legal and democratic legitimacy of the (EU) executive decision-making.",Maastricht Universiteit,,,,,,,,Maastricht Universiteit,,Aida Halilovic,,,,,,,,Aida Halilovic,,Security,Asylum,Comparative Perspective,,,,,,THE EMPOWERMENT OF AFSJ AGENCIES AND THE INTEGRATION OF THE EU ADMINISTRATION,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65741&EventID=185

For first time since their transition to democracy in 1974, and, in contrast to what has become common in European countries since the late 1990s, in 2019 Chega was de first radical right party to obtain representation in the Portuguese Parliament and its leader came third at 2021 Presidential elections.
Its rapid rise and consolidation in the Portuguese political system, where it is the third political force, have generated numerous debates abouts its ideological nature, whether Chega is a radical right party or a rehabilitative offensive of the dictatorial past to establish a new authoritarian regime in Portugal. 
The objective of this paper is to analyse the context where the emergence of Chega is framed, elucidating its ideological nature, analysing the profile of its electorate, and locating this political formation on the map of the European radical right. 
To this purpose, firstly, it will be delved into a review of the existing literature on radical right in Portugal with the aim of studying the process of rise and consolidation of Chega in the Portuguese political system. Then, through a qualitative analysis of Chega´s electoral programs and discourse it will be studied its ideological nature, to later locate it on the map of the European radical right. Finally, using the online survey data from the Portuguese nation elections in 2019, 2021 and 2022, it will be analysed Chega´s electoral support.",Maria Curie-Sklodowska University,,,,,,,,Maria Curie-Sklodowska University,,Alberto Escribano,,,,,,,,Alberto Escribano,,Democracy,European Union,Political Parties,Voting Behaviour,,,,,"The end of the Portuguese exceptionalism.

By studying the cases of Georgia and Serbia, the first part of the paper seeks to explore the nature of the EPP’s engagement with its non-EU sister parties from the selected cases. The second part aims at analyzing the EPP’s rationale of engagement as well as at explaining whether the EPP develop different degrees of engagement with the Serbian sister parties as compared with the Georgian sister parties.  
In order to analyze the EPP’s engagement, the paper follow the three main steps. First, it conceptualizes the EPP’s engagement, second  - it demonstrates the EPP’s (potentially) different engagement with the Serbian parties as compared with the Georgian parties, third - it explains the EPP’s (potentially) different engagement by analyzing the independent variables suggested by the paper methodology, which are: EU enlargement perspective, party transformation, political influence, competition with other Europarties and longevity of engagement. 
Our general expectation is that the EPP’s engagement is higher with the parties from the Western Balkan countries compared to the parties from the Eastern Partnership countries due to the presence and respectively the absence of an EU enlargement perspective.

The Trump administration, for instance, numerous times reminded European leaders that NATO, not the EU, is the key in the Western military alliance. Moreover, the Trump administration officials expressed deep concern about the European Defence Fund that is considered one of the steps towards European strategic autonomy. The new president of the US Joe Biden, on the other hand, underlines the restoration and strengthening of the transatlantic partnership amongst its top foreign policy priorities. The Biden administration also highlights that a strong EU remains in the EU interest. The paper explores the external factors that affect the development of the EU strategic autonomy and examines how the US approaches the EU thriving towards strategic autonomy in the defence domain. Has the US approach towards the EU strategic autonomy been dynamic? What concept of the European strategic autonomy would the US find acceptable (if any) or even beneficial? How might the pursuit of European strategic autonomy possibly affect the relations between the US and EU? With what risks and opportunities does this idea is associated in the Biden administration?

0,"The armed conflict in Colombia is no longer a national issue. International actors have participated in projects to bring peace to the affected territories. One of them has been the European Union and the multi-donor fund, called the European Trust Fund for Colombia. The fund supports the implementation of the peace agreement signed between the Colombian government and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia - People's Army (FARC-EP) in 2016. Funded projects include engagement in social dialogue and with communities; public-private partnerships to maximize peace dividends; targeted investment to achieve a social protection floor; and most recently, an emphasis on green jobs to reduce environmental impact. The fund was born with two main priorities: rural development (Point 1) and the reincorporation of ex-combatants (Point 3) in PDET-prioritized territories. Victims and ex-combatants are involved in the projects. 

The Fund currently includes contributions from 21 member states and has a budget of 127 million euros. It implies a development architecture that influences, directs and conditions investment.  A preliminary review of the literature, allows positioning it in a theoretical model of hybrid peace, with an emphasis on ""local ownership"". However, complaints from local actors indicate a possible centralisation in regional agencies that does not involve the grassroots community. Therefore, we seek to identify whether it is presented as a 'renewed' agenda in discourse, but in practice perpetuates the liberal peace model under a curtain of state-building.  

However, when the government in power hinders, slows down or fails to comply with the agreement, international actors are called upon to exert political pressure. In this case, the Fund can also be used as a soft power tool to influence the implementation of the agreement through international diplomacy. Consequently, this paper aims to answer, first, what is the model of peace that the architecture of the Fund expresses?, Second, has the Fund been a tool of diplomatic pressure to accelerate so-called ""Peace with legality"" of the current government? To answer these questions, we will use qualitative approach based on two phases of data collection. The first phase consisted of a documentary review of the agencies and actors in charge of the administration of the EU Trust Fund for Colombia, a secondary source research.

0,"The issues of solidarity and social justice remain of crucial importance for the political and social architecture of the European Union on the eve of the third year of the Covid-19 pandemic. Deep socio-economic inequalities became more visible in these years both within the EU member states, and beyond the borders of the Union, in its Eastern and South Eastern peripheries. The EU institutions enacted from the very beginning several - more or less successful - solidarity mechanisms regarding the management of the crisis and (re)distribution of the resources among the member states. At the same time, the European countries involved in the process of accession as candidate or potential candidate countries received far less financial and medical support in dealing with the health, social and economic impacts of the pandemic. The paper examines major socio-political effects of this crisis, considering particularly the case of Western Balkan countries, and the way it had affected the current state of the European integration and enlargement process.
The empirical inquiry focused on the EU support to these countries, their citizens, and people on the move within their borders, in the context of the pandemic.

0,"Throughout the last decades, EU asylum policy has undergone continuous enhancements of competences, resulting in one of the most dynamic policy areas of EU integration. Within scholarly debates, studies have focused on the analysis of EU asylum policy referring to theories of EU integration (neo-functionalism vs. liberal intergovernmentalism), to the institutional setting of the policy (supranational vs. intergovernmental), as well as to the transposition of the policy at the national level. Even though some scholars have engaged in bridging the fields of EU studies and public policy (as far as this specific policy area is concerned) by applying the Advocacy Coalition Framework (ACF) to analyse the development of specific legal provisions (Ripoll Servent & Trauner, 2014), still a big gap exists related to the interconnection of public policy and refugee studies (El-Taliawi et al., 2021). This paper strives to start filling this gap from a theoretical perspective. Due to the complexity of EU policymaking, the ACF is considered to be the most suitable policy process framework in order to analyse EU asylum policy process as well as policy change. Therefore, the present paper critically engages with the motivations supporting this statement, by outlining the main assumptions of the framework and their adaptability to the EU as well as to EU asylum policy. Moreover, with the objective of accounting for the multiple crises faced by the EU – in general –, and by EU asylum policy subsystem – in particular – the paper draws on the crisis approach literature. More specifically, the paper integrates the ACF with the theorisation of creeping crisis, in order to thoroughly consider the effects that crises may have on policy change. Fulfilling such task, would not only lead to an array of assumptions specifically relating the ACF to EU policymaking, but also to a set of hypotheses to be empirically tested. Notwithstanding the fact that the hypotheses will be drawn to be empirically tested on EU asylum policy, it is supposed that they may be adapted to different EU policy areas, providing the tools for a more systematic analysis of EU policy process and policy change in times of crisis.",Università di Bologna,,,,,,,,Università di Bologna,,Laura Mastroianni,,,,,,,,Laura Mastroianni,,European Union,Policy Analysis,Public Policy,Policy Change,Policy-Making,Theoretical,,,The European Union in Crises: an Advocacy Coalition Framework Perspective,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63258&EventID=185
0,"The 2021 Batumi summit declaration of the Associated Trio (Ukraine, Moldova and Georgia) appeal to the European Union (EU) policy-makers to reconsider the concept of the Eastern partnership (EaP) and provide a clear declaration on membership perspectives for the EaP countries. In the light of serious geopolitical challenges and democracy threats faced by these countries the discussion on the possible change in the eastern dimension of the EU neighbourhood policy seems topical and necessary. Such discussion should raise the issue of a new tailor-made approach to be applied in a non-uniform manner which takes into consideration existing threats and challenges for the democratisation processes in associated states as potential candidate states. Therefore, the main purpose of the paper is to analyse the factors that contribute to success or failure of the democratisation processes in the Associated Trio including examples of successful EU initiatives and overall impact of the EU and Russia as competing structural powers in the region. The paper poses a question whether the EU might become a transformative structural power as far as its eastern policy-making is concerned and how successful its structural foreign policy has been in supporting the democratic resilience in the associated states since the 2019 European Parliament elections. To answer this question, it seems necessary to divide the factors directly or indirectly influencing the potential of the EU as a structural power in the EaP into the following categories: political, economical, social and religious.

0,"The literature shows that multiple crises in the EU in the last decade have increased Euroscepticism, which is also true for Southern Europe, particularly affected by the Eurozone debt crisis. Although there is a growing bulk of literature on Euroscepticism in Europe, it fails to fully explore the relation between Euroscepticism and exceptionally severe crises, namely in the Portuguese context where two leftist Eurosceptic parties co-exist - the Portuguese Communist Party (PCP) and Left Block (LB) - from the early days of Portugal as a Member State.  This research aims at studying if and how the Eurozone debt crisis, particularly the troika intervention in the country (2011-2014), and the following 2015 parliamentary coalition with PCP and LB supporting the Socialist Party Europeanist government (the so-called Geringonça), influenced the Euroscepticism of PCP and LB. Based on an adaptation of Taggart and Szczerbiak (2001), and of Kopecky and Mudde (2002) theoretical frameworks on Euroscepticism, the paper intends to answer one chief research question: which was the impact of Eurozone crisis and of Geringonça in the leftist Euroscepticism in Portugal? For the analysis’ purpose, Euroscepticism is assumed as a dependent variable of two independent variables: (i) the troika intervention in Portugal (2011-2014), following the 2008 great recession and the Eurozone sovereign debt crisis, and (ii) the Geringonça coalition legislature (2015-2019), corresponding to the 22nd Constitutional Government. The independent variables are supported in the literature that shows that (i) moments of economic crises are boosters for the ideological increment of Euroscepticism, and that (ii) party strategies for power, like coalitions, are a cause for the moderation of Eurosceptic stances.  Therefore, our hypothesis is that during the troika intervention in Portugal, PCP and LB toughened their Eurosceptic positions, whereas during the Geringonça coalition they softened their Euroscepticism. To test this, the paper uses as empirical data manifestos for European elections from 1999 to 2019, a period comprising the year when Euro entered into force, coincident with the first European elections to which LB run for, and the year of the last European elections, when Portugal was experiencing economic growth and marked the end of the Geringonça legislature.

It was intended to break the deadlock in which the EU and the Member States were following the “refugee crisis'' in 2014-2016 and after the adoption of the New Agenda on Migration in 2016. The idea behind the Pact was to build a new consensus around key policies in the field of migration and asylum. Even though this consensus is not reached, the Pact proposes significant changes in several dimensions, from border management, solidarity mechanisms, to emergency measures and return. The overall visions reflect a move of the European Commission toward enhanced intergovernmentalism, fragmentation and securitization. The paper explores the formation of these policy preferences of the Commission, tracing the unfolding and impact of several crises in the period 2014 - 2020 and how key institutional and organizational actors reacted to it.

0,"Did partisan politics matter for research policy in Western Europe over the last decades, and if so how? A possible answer is that partisan actors do not matter much to research policy at all, due to low saliency and widespread agreement on goals such as high-quality research conducted efficiently, providing new knowledge that contributes to growth and societal improvement. Under such conditions, it seems unlikely that political parties can reap major electoral benefits from their research policies. Consequently, partisan actors may not devote resources to developing research-policy positions, instead leaving the details of policymaking to bureaucracy and stakeholders. Another possible answer is that partisan political interest in research policy has strengthened over time, with the increasing share of GDP devoted to research funding and the growing importance of research to an increasing number of other, salient policy areas making, potentially leading to partisan disagreement on which research goals that should be prioritized. Previous literature do not systematically investigate this question empirically.
This paper seeks to start filling these gaps by asking how variation in partisan research policy-positions expressed in party manifestos evolve from the 70s and onward. Theoretically, I argue that partisan political actors are likely to care about research policy to the extent that the parties and their constituents believe research is important to other, more salient, policy issues. Drawing on literature on partisan politics, I provide an account of when and how various partisan actors may conceive of research as important to other policy areas. Based on this account, I develop a set of propositions on variation in partisan research policy-positions in terms of saliency and other policy issues tied to research policy. These propositions structure my empirical analysis, but due to the lack of strong expectations and previous research on partisan political variation, I keep my analysis exploratory.
Empirically, I utilize existing data on political manifestos in a novel fashion.  First, I apply a simple dictionary of research words consisting of different versions of research, science, researcher and scientist to party manifestos.  These keywords may or may not entail a research policy position. Therefore, the second step of my initial data collection is a content analysis of sentences surrounding a sample of the words detected in the first step. I use these data in three ways: 
1)	Quantitative estimation of saliency through the relative frequency of research policy positions
2)	Quantitative estimation of the number of other policy issues partisan actors tie research policy to. Drawing on content analyses of party manifesto provided by the Comparative Manifesto project and the Comparative Agendas project, I am also able to get some leverage on which policy-issues partisan political actors tie research policy to from the late 90s and onward. 
3)	Qualitative content analysis of the content of partisan research policy positions allowing me to probe for other forms of variation in the content of partisan research policy positions in further detail.",Universitetet i Oslo,,,,,,,,Universitetet i Oslo,,Erlend Langørgen,,,,,,,,Erlend Langørgen,,Party Manifestos,Public Policy,Knowledge,Quantitative,,,,,The evolution of partisan research policy positions in Western Europe,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63579&EventID=185
0,"Multilateral global financial governance long before the COVID-19 pandemic required reforms to keep pace with the changing dynamics of the global economy. The pandemic only highlighted the extent of its weaknesses. Since the onset of the pandemic functioning of international financial institutions (IFIs) has been oriented towards achieving two major goals. On the one hand, it was a continuation of earlier initiatives aimed at ensuring an appropriate level of regulation and stability of international finance. On the other, the efforts of IFIs were directed at maximizing funds needed for mitigating the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, inclusive multilateral COVID-19 vaccine funding (e.g., COVAX). As one of the biggest threats to the stability of the global financial system caused by the constitute rising levels of sovereign debt, another set of IFIs activities included debt relief and debt cancelation programs, especially for the low-income countries. The European Union (EU) as a global actor enmeshed in the current complex and multilevel global financial governance structures has found itself at the core of these actions. In the case of the EU, the need to intervene at the global to transform and adapt IFIs actions in the face of the more and more volatile and uncertain international environment comes together with the need to counteract its steadily declining status in the structures of global financial governance. 
 
The paper seeks to assess the evolving role of the EU institutions in the governance of global finance in the face of the pandemic. It investigates the EU's ability to transform and adapt its actions in line with the global actions taken by selected IFIs (IMF, World Bank Group, FSB, BIS). The paper argues that during the pandemic the EU has proved its commitment to establish more efficient and inclusive governance of global finance on a multilateral and multipolar basis.

0,"There is a vibrant debate on the feasibility of different low-carbon energy technologies ranging from concerns about the reliance on negative emission technologies to the implausibility of low energy demand and rapid upscaling of renewables. At the moment, this debate is largely stalled because different scholars use diverse types of evidence for feasibility. However, systematically assessing and comparing the feasibility of different climate solutions requires a rigorous scientific language.

Here we propose such a language and develop a framework to assess the theoretical and empirical evidence for the feasibility of climate solutions based on a novel tool called the ‘feasibility ladder’. We use this framework to resolve the current impasse on the feasibility by developing a systematic approach to compare different types of evidence on the feasibility of low-carbon options based on the presence and strength of different causal analogies. 

We depart from recent attempts to project ladders of evidence from other policy relevant fields such as health care and instead develop the ladder based on the intellectual history of the climate and energy field. At the base of the ladder are visionary climate solutions such as the seminal work from 1985 which argued that a sustainable world was “feasible” if the most efficient energy technologies were deployed universally to achieve Western European lifestyles while keeping energy demand at a low level. At this rung of the ladder, the empirical evidence are best practices in laboratories or demonstrations, and the theoretical evidence are general principles, such as the laws of physics and the belief that there is public and political support for convergence in living standards. 

At the next rung of the ladder are models used for scenarios for transforming technical and social systems which stay within carbon budgets or meet emission targets while improving living standards. This approach emerged relatively early in the climate debate most notably with the IPCC. Mitigation pathways have since come to dominate discussions around the feasibility of climate mitigation. This rung relies on techno-economic theories and stylized mechanisms but has been criticized for neglecting key theories and mechanisms of social and political feasibility.

These gaps have been addressed at the third rung of the ladder where scholars evaluate the feasibility of modeled pathways based on the presence of historical precedents for similar types of changes. Here the rate of technological change and overall decarbonization are used as a historical precedent to assess the feasibility of the change depicted in climate change mitigation pathways. 

We conclude our contribution with an outlook for how to further develop the feasibility ladder and how to use this tool to structure the current stalemate in the current debate. While most of the work on feasibility has used historical evidence, we point to how current policies and targets can complement these historical analogies. And second we argue for shifting from using the term “feasible” in a binary sense to using it probabilistically and that feasibility spaces a tool is a useful analytical tool to make this shift.",Central European University,Universitetet i Bergen,,,,,,,Universitetet i Bergen,,Aleh Cherp,Jessica Jewell,,,,,,,Jessica Jewell,,Climate Change,Energy,Energy Policy,Theoretical,,,,,The feasibility ladder of energy transitions for climate change: An intellectual history and the road ahead,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65142&EventID=185
0,"European integration and enlargement of the European Union (EU) also to the South Europe as well as Central and Eastern Europe has contributed to further diversity of the European Union. Although the EU acknowledges its diversity which is recognised also from: 1) the moto of the EU: “United in diversity”, as well as in 2) recognition of all 24 officials languages and 3) position of European cultural policy whose aim is to create a common European sense of belonging while complementing national and regional identities, the EU aims to build collective European identity that would further strengthen its integration. The concern what holds EU together becomes even more relevant during times of crises and instability. These were quite a few during the last period such as financial crises (2008-2011), migration crises (2015-2016) and health crises (2020-2021). With growing populism especially of right wing populist parties and authoritative politics in Europe the EU member states have approached this crises with different approaches causing further differentiation in the EU. The EU is supporting the building of the European identity through financial support of different projects and programmes that support European idea and values. Most recognised is Erasmus mobility programme. In this paper we are interested in how strong and present is European identity among those that are most directly involved in European projects that seek to strengthen European identity. We will analyse the public opinion data gathered in a survey among secondary and elementary school teachers as well as among students that participated in EU related project activities. Our assumption is that teachers and students that participate in EU related activities developed more recognisable European identity compared to the general population. The data will be analysed on the case of Slovenia.",University of Ljubljana,University of Ljubljana,,,,,,,University of Ljubljana,,Damjan Lajh,Meta Novak,,,,,,,Damjan Lajh,,Citizenship,European Union,Education,,,,,,The feeling of European identity among elementary and secondary school students and teachers,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64091&EventID=185
0,"In the last decade, new kinds of European populist parties and movements deeply dissatisfied with representative democracy and characterized by a left wing, right wing or “eclectic” attitude have succeeded in entering the higher political institutions, not only within the parliament but also within the cabinet as major or junior coalition partners. In particular, since 2018 Italy has experienced three different governments where the eclectic and anti-party Five Star Movement has played a major role as coalition partner first of the radical right wing populist League (2018-2019) and then of the mainstream center left Democratic Party (2019-2021). In addition to this, at present the Five Star Movement is a coalition partner of the current Draghi Government. Such a scenario offers the right tools to investigate to what extent the anti-system Five Star Movement has remained faithful to its original principles and populist attitude or if it has itself been a “victim” of the influence of other parties and the institutional environment in which it has played, especially since 2018. In particular, according to this research based on the ideological definition of populism and on a new “revised” model of the inclusionary exclusionary framework to classify populist parties, the eclectic character and strong internal horizontal democracy of the Five Star Movement play a crucial role in order to answer this question. Taking into consideration the years 2017- 2020 the present investigation will first conduct a qualitative analysis of the Five Star Movement in order to depict its profile, goals and organizational structure and how this might have changed over time. Second, we will make use of quantitative and qualitative content analysis on parliamentary speeches and press conference statements in order to measure the degree of populism of the Five Star Movement and how this might have changed over time. Third, in order to dig into the Five Star Movement’s world and find out if it still reflects the original anti-system principles and if it is still based on a strong internal horizontal democracy, this study collected 33 semi-structured interviews with Five Star Movement representatives at the national, regional and local level in 2021. To be noted that this research can also rely on 20 interviews with Five Star representatives collected in 2017 with the same questionnaire. As a source of data, we will address public sources such as public statements, official manifestos, parliamentary speeches and semi structured interviews. The importance of this research is threefold. First, it will contribute to understanding if populists in power necessarily need to tone down their anti-system character in order to survive. Second, the eclectic Five Star Movement represents a case in point of populists in power because of its features as a post ideological actor and because it has already experienced two government coalitions with two completely different political players. Third, this study introduces novelties within the study of populism because it proposes a new way to operationalize the ideological approach and because through its interviews it shows what populists think of populism.",Università di Bologna,,,,,,,,Università di Bologna,,Anna Grazia Napoletano,,,,,,,,Anna Grazia Napoletano,,Democracy,Political Parties,Populism,Internet,Mixed Methods,Political Ideology,Power,Influence,The Five Star Movement in government: A rebel at the wheel?,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65671&EventID=185

Although metallurgical (met) coal, i.e. the coal used in iron and steel production, stands for 16% of global coal consumption, it has so far been left out of the discussion on coal phase-out policy. This study aims to fill this gap by exploring what it takes to phase out metallurgical coal on a global level. It does so by narratively situating met coal  in three distinct perspectives of deliberate decline - substitution, destabilisation, and unmaking - based on data collected through interviews, desktop study and policy process observation. The analysis reveals similarities and differences between the metallurgical and thermal coal phase-outs. It further identifies knowledge, economic, institutional, power, and discursive barriers to phasing out met coal and locates leverage points in research, policy, coalition-building, discursive struggle, and grassroots action. The study concludes that while met coal sits firmly in its saddle today, its future looks turbulent.",Lunds Universitet,,,,,,,,Lunds Universitet,,Valentin Vogl,,,,,,,,Valentin Vogl,,Political Economy,International,Climate Change,Energy,Energy Policy,Transitional justice,,,The forgotten fossil fuel: barriers and leverage points in phasing out metallurgical coal,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65242&EventID=185
0,"Climate change is one of the greatest challenges faced by humanity. However, the current global politics struggle to implement collective solutions. In this context, young people have recently entered the international political arena. Greta Thunberg, a young woman, attracted massive attention on climate change at UN conferences. Furthermore, many youth organizations are active both in formal and informal politics. Youth actors are increasingly intervening in the Conferences of the Parties (COP) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) through various channels, including YOUNGO (official youth constituencies of the UNFCCC), youth delegates, or the Youth Advisory Group on Climate Change. Youth environmental organizations such as Nature and Youth (Norway) and Young Energy Specialists and Development Cooperation (Netherlands) have attended the UNFCCC COPs since its very first meeting in 1995. Also, major environmental non-governmental organizations are opening youth branches. While youth representation is evolving with unprecedented speed in global climate politics, there is no comprehensive scientific knowledge of their profiles and networks at the transnational level. Recently, there has been an increasing number of studies on informal youth actions, especially through the Fridays for Future (FFF) movement, but very few deal with the broader scope of youth formal participation in international climate change politics.
This paper aims to fill this gap. As the first step of a four-year project on youth in earth politics, the paper presents the results of the first systematic inventory of youth actors in the UNFCCC between 1995-2021. This database enables discussion of youth actors’ presence in different negotiation processes over time and their institutionalization as well as socialization in the international political game. The social network of the youth actors on the database will be analyzed with R and Gephi. In addition, the discourses used by the prominent actors identified in the social network analysis will be analyzed through their official statements collected from online searches. Are there ties among youth actors who formally attend the climate negotiations, and what are the ties? Are they linked to informal climate movements? What kind of discourses are shared by youth actors actively involved in formal types of political actions (formal participation) at the transnational level? What are the similarities and differences of the networks of the formal youth climate movement compared to other social movements? By answering those questions, the paper will shed light on the formal political engagement of youth actors at the international level on climate change issues.",Université Saint-Louis - Bruxelles,Université Saint-Louis - Bruxelles,,,,,,,Université Saint-Louis - Bruxelles,,Yi hyun Kang,Amandine Orsini,,,,,,,Yi hyun Kang,,International Relations,Social Movements,International,Climate Change,NGOs,Youth,,,The formal transnational networks of the youth climate movement,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63394&EventID=185
0,"The Anthropocene concept has been criticized for displaying a depoliticizing vision of politics, as it evaluates the present from a position millions of years from now, making the future appear (literally) set in stone. Politics in general, and democracy in particular, requires temporal contingency, i.e. that things don’t need to be tomorrow what they are today. In this paper, I investigate the prospect of introducing contingency into the narrative of the Anthropocene by the employment of utopian thinking. By reviewing the functions of utopian thought in green thinking, I examine what characteristics are needed in order for Utopian thinking to function as a fertile ground for politicization. I argue that its politicizing potential lies in the possibility to infuse hope, make a radical break with the present and to offer the possibility of estrangement. Furthermore, I zoom in on the formulations of utopia in three widespread narratives of the relationship between society and nature in the Anthropocene (the ecomodernist good Anthropocene, the eco-Marxist bad Anthropocene and the new materialist entangled Anthropocene) to look for the emergence of politics. I argue that although none of the narratives manage to completely politicize the Anthropocene concept, all three display utopian feature which in different ways can be helpful to counteract the presence of post-politics in environmental discourse.",Uppsala Universitet,,,,,,,,Uppsala Universitet,,Kristin Hällmark,,,,,,,,Kristin Hällmark,,Green Politics,Political Theory,Climate Change,,,,,,The future is set in stone: on utopian thinking in the Anthropocene,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65097&EventID=185
0,"Abstract: Many observers of EU politics are wondering how the future of the Union will look like after Brexit. Against this background, this paper investigates public opinion on the future of the EU Post-Brexit using data from 8 European member states (Germany, France, Spain, Hungary, Poland, Denmark, Italy, Austria). The dependent variable is the support for one of the 5 scenarios from Juncker’s white paper. The independent variables include citizens’ preferences regarding levels of policy-making across various fields, importance of key policy projects, perceptions of Brexit, as well as social and political predispositions. The results will show which future scenario has the most support, who supports it, and why. The results aim to contribute to the ongoing debate about the future of the post-Brexit EU.

0,"Women have been found to be more supportive of redistribution and social spending across established, Western, democracies. The size of these gender gaps varies across time and space, and yet, the comparative literature on attitudinal gender gaps has largely neglected the role of the generational dimension and the political and policy context when it comes to accounting for this variation. In this paper, we look at both the generational and systemic influences on gender differences in attitudes towards redistribution and social spending. Broader contexts and welfare systems should be relevant for understanding attitudinal gender gaps in preferences for social spending and redistribution since women’s greater support for these measures is in theory linked to their greater reliance on welfare services, and so the manner and extent to which these are provided should affect demand in a gendered way. Using comparative survey data from European and Anglo-American democracies, we examine how the broader context impacts on the gender generation gap in support for redistribution and social spending. The extent to which the policy context matters for attitudinal gender gaps has implications for both preferences for state action in the population as well as for the types of gender vote gaps that we might expect to see play out across different contexts.","Queen Mary, University of London",University of Oxford,,,,,,,"Queen Mary, University of London",,Maria Grasso,Rosalind Shorrocks,,,,,,,Maria Grasso,,Gender,Voting,Comparative Perspective,Political Ideology,,,,,The Gender Generation Gap in Preferences for Social Spending and Redistribution: A Comparative Analysis,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64855&EventID=185
0,"In a context of a rising geo-economic order, debates and policies on the energy transition have become growingly embedded into wider geo-strategic considerations. The EU and its member states have toughened their screening mechanisms on foreign investment on grounds of national security and introduced new mechanisms to curtail externally subsidized foreign transactions, affecting the energy sector in particular. The goal of reducing the EU’s strategic vulnerabilities in the green energy supply chains has also given place to a number of initiatives such as the new strategies and European Alliances on batteries, critical materials and hydrogen. The EU thus seems to be following the US geo-economic strategies of ‘shielding’, ‘stifling’ and ‘spurring’ (Roberts et al. 2019) to fend off and decouple from China and other strategic competitors. This paper  examines (i) the ideational and institutional drivers of this geostrategic turn, focusing on the notion of ‘strategic vulnerabilities’, and  (ii) the extent to which the newly adopted instruments are leading to building new interdependencies or decoupling from global value chains.",Maastricht Universiteit,,,,,,,,Maastricht Universiteit,,Anna Herranz-Surrallés,,,,,,,,Anna Herranz-Surrallés,,European Politics,Foreign Policy,International Relations,Political Economy,Security,Investment,Trade,Energy Policy,The geo-economic turn of the European energy transition: ‘strategic vulnerabilities’ and the re-definition of interdependence,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65920&EventID=185

While the causes of the dwindling support for democratic regimes have been widely analysed, hitherto no research has yet explored whether there is also a geographical component to this kind of democratic deconsolidation. In this paper, we evaluate the rural-urban divide of public preferences for democracy and its authoritarian alternatives. We would like to find out whether possible rural-urban differences are due to the different socio-economic situation, to different values or to the degree of political discontent of urbanites and rural dwellers. Using recent European Values Survey data on 29 European countries and over 30’000 respondents from 2017 to 2020, we show that rural residents are more supportive of authoritarian regimes than urban dwellers are. Moreover, our multilevel structural equation models indicate that socio-economic and cultural differences between urbanites and ruralites are particularly crucial, while the political mechanisms cannot explain the spatial divide of regime preferences.",Universität Bern,Universität Bern,,,,,,,Universität Bern,,Markus Freitag,Alina Zumbrunn,,,,,,,Alina Zumbrunn,,Democracy,Quantitative,Comparative Perspective,Survey Research,,,,,The Geography of Autocracy.

0,"It has been argued that deliberative democracy may be the most effective approach for tackling a global socio-ecological problem as complex as climate change. The last decade has witnessed a multiplicity of climate citizen assemblies at national and local levels, intended to guide decision-making on climate policy. Well-known examples include the Irish Citizens’ Assembly in 2016, the French Citizens’ Convention for climate in 2019 and the Climate Assembly UK in 2019. Advocates for climate assemblies argue that citizens participating in such a type of mini-public may be more receptive to climate science and interested in prioritising long-term goals, and concern for future generations, than their elected counterparts. Building on these attempts to address the climate emergency at the national level, a Global Assembly was established in 2021, the first of its kind, bringing together a group of 100 people from around the world to convey the voices of citizens in global climate governance, a space where they are generally absent. In this paper, we analyse this unique experiment looking at both internal and external aspects of the Assembly. First, our paper analyses the Assembly’s deliberations about global governance and how they shaped the writing of the Declaration that was presented at COP26 in Glasgow. Second, it assesses its impact with regards to its visibility in side-events and connection to decision-making processes at COP26. Finally, we consider what lessons this experience may offer to future Global Assemblies.

0,"Many issue areas of world politics are today governed by overlapping institutions that form global governance complexes. In this paper, we outline a framework that advances the emerging research agenda on institutional complexity in global governance in three directions. First, by identifying central dimensions along which systems of overlapping institutions vary—scale, diversity and density—we unite existing concepts of regime complexes, institutional complexes, polycentric governance and hybrid governance systems. Rather than competing concepts, we suggest these can be conceived as different manifestations of the same genus: a global governance complex (GGC). Second, by theorizing the effects of structural variation in GGCs for governance outcomes, we build a foundation for comparative research—across policy areas, regions and time—which may deepen our understanding of the causes and effects of institutional complexity in global politics. Third, methodologically, we discuss new quantitative and qualitative metrics which allow scholars to gauge dimensions of variation in institutional complexity.

0,"It has become a commonplace to describe the current state of the GOP as drifting towards increasingly questionable positions that border on the authoritarian – at least in the outlets of the ‘mainstream’ media. Up until its recent censure of the capitol riots of January 6th 2021 as ‘legitimate political discourse’ the Republican Party in the thrall of ex- and potential future president Trump has exhibited a tendency towards acrimonious extremism, be it with regard to anti-corona policies, immigration issues or women’s reproductive rights. But behind this seemingly straightforward description loom important and yet unanswered questions, the two main ones of which this paper seeks to address. 
First, there is the question as to how to capture the ideological trajectory and positioning of the Republican Party in the vocabulary of conservatism. Is this a party that has simply taken a turn towards more staunchly conservative positions, located more to the right of the political spectrum? Or is it conceptually feasible and also political necessary to describe this trajectory as one in which the GOP (or at least significant elements within it) has effectively left behind mainstream conservatism to move towards something that recent commentators have dubbed ‘radicalized conservatism’ but which might be more appropriately referred to as authoritarianism? Answering this question presupposes a reflection on what constitutes conservatism as an ideology, where its boundaries are located and how it relates to what lies beyond these. 
Second, how do we account for this trajectory? To crouch the question into a simplified dichotomy: Was the GOP ‘trumpified’ in the sense that he transformed a mainstream conservative party into one that borders on the right-wing populist or authoritarian? Or was Trump more of a symptom of the process that the GOP was undergoing and an effect of what was already transpiring in its DNA? If the latter turns out to be the more plausible interpretation, this begs additional questions: What factors can explain this ideological shift in the GOP; what role does, for example, the rise of the Tea Party in the wake of the election of Obama play; how does the Bush II administration with its well-documented corrosion of constitutional values figure in such an account? And more fundamentally, in what ways does this force us to reconsider the well-established historical narrative of the GOP as a party that had shed its ‘lunatic fringe’ during the Reagan years and positioned itself as a reliably center-right political force? Depending on what insights the inquiry yields the narrative of a chastened party that had expunged its racist elements etc. might turn out to have been ill-informed.

0,"In the last few years, the use of auctions has gained a momentum in the electricity sector, they have widely diffused. Economic and policy research has focused on the diversity of auction design involving criteria such as technological neutrality or specificity, restrictive conditions for developers, ceiling prices, socio-economic objectives, etc. Although existing case studies provide rich information on the actors that implement auction regimes, this aspect has still not been studied for itself. In other words, we are still missing insights on the governance of auctions. This paper provides an explanatory framework for the governance of auctions from the public administration and governance perspective looking beyond the design of the auction. Governance of auctions refers to the ‘who does what’ in the auction regime. More broadly, it relates to the extent and modalities of public authority engagement in the auction regime. We identify two dimensions: regulation and coordination. On the one hand, the public authority decides to impose (or not) a series of criteria on bidders (technology, capacity, socio-economic development, etc.) in order to steer industrial forces and thus control the evolution of the sector through ex-ante rules (regulation). On the other hand, the public authority may coordinate the actors involved in the different tasks and decisions that intervene in the implementation of auction projects in order to facilitate its completion, for example by coordinating land permits and grid interconnection obtention (coordination). 
	
We base our empirical investigation of auction governance on a most-different case comparison, involving Great Britain and Morocco, two countries differing widely regarding various relevant factors, in particular the extent of liberalization of the electricity sector, the political economy of the sector and the type of political regime. The research considers the recent historical experiences with renewable energy auctions and shows, in both countries, the proactive deployment of regulation to achieve broad socio-economic benefits - beyond just competitive price. This reveals a convergence across both highly and little- liberalized sectors towards the inclusion of multiple policy objectives related to the electricity sector. This also shows the auctions’ hybrid character, their capacity to strike a middle ground between authority and market, allowing both governments in liberalized systems to steer private investment in politically desirable directions that would not be fostered by the market alone (e.g. inclusion of socio-economic development criteria) and to tap into the private forces in little liberalized systems in order to foster the development of generation capacity, particularly needed in developing countries. Both cases also show the significance of coordination in facilitating the delivery of projects in areas like local value chain development, land (and continental shelf) management, and the investment on the grid. Finally, we consider the implications for the future political economy of the electricity industry, as new governance tools attenuate the distinctions between liberalized and a non- or partially liberalized industries.",Université de Lausanne,University of Oxford,,,,,,,Université de Lausanne,,Emmanuelle Mathieu,Jose Maria Valenzuela,,,,,,,Emmanuelle Mathieu,,Governance,Policy Analysis,Public Administration,Public Policy,Regulation,Energy Policy,,,The governance of renewable energy auctions and the convergence of liberalized and non-liberalized electricity markets,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64870&EventID=185
0,"Following the first local government declaration of a climate emergency by Darebin Council in December 2016, over 2,000 local authorities in 38 countries have declared climate emergencies, with many also developing and implementing strategies to achieve net zero emissions.  Wide variation nevertheless exists in the scope and pace of emissions reduction envisaged and in the approaches used to pursue transitions to a low-carbon future that might be at least partly explained by the common challenge facing local governments in balancing ambition, durability, credibility and justice within local net-zero plans. The aspiration imperative variously incorporates values-driven desires to contribute to the broader endeavour of climate protection and resilience, pressures from activist groups, concerned citizens and other stakeholders, and counteracting perceived gaps in national and international climate policies. The durability imperative (enacted through plan design, statutory provisions and norm-shifting) derives from recognition of the need to insulate net-zero plans from dilution or repeal by future local governments and waning momentum in the face of implementation difficulties.  Credibility, meanwhile, relates to developing initiatives that increase the prospects of achieving ambitions and includes partnerships with businesses, third-sector organisations and other local governments, and local-central government interfaces to encourage national policies (e.g. planning and infrastructure) that support – or at least do not undermine – local initiatives.  Finally, justice imperatives centre on ensuring low-carbon plans are inclusive and do not create or reproduce inequalities and hardships that might undermine the popular support and mandates that gave fuel to local government net-zero strategies.

This ambition-durability-credibility-justice framework provides a lens for interrogating a range of questions about the politics of local climate emergency declarations.  Through what processes and in what ways have local authorities sought to reconcile these priorities, particularly where imperatives misalign?  What trade-offs have arisen, for example, between setting ambitious targets and ensuring net-zero plans achieve sufficient lock-in, through design or consensus building, to produce meaningful long-term impacts?  How are trade-offs being managed and what are their implications for the politics of local net-zero initiatives and their change potential?  This paper explores these issues using analysis of net-zero plans published by UK metropolitan, county, and unitary councils and 15 interviews with councillors and officials involved in the development of plans.  The analysis reveals pronounced tensions between ambition and durability that many local governments have tried to ease by stressing scientific evidence to build support for actions on more contentious issues, incorporating flexibility to ensure plans remained adaptable to new information and changing, a strong emphasis on public and stakeholder consultation on targets and priorities, and stressing the co-benefits of climate action to bolster the acceptability of actions to different stakeholder groups.  Some of the balancing acts performed to enhance durability and a sense of just transitions nevertheless have important repercussions for the ambition and credibility of plans, where striving for acceptance has compromised the aspirations that initially gave rise to the climate emergency idea.","PLYMOUTH, University of",,,,,,,,University of Plymouth,,Ian Bailey,,,,,,,,Ian Bailey,,Local Government,Policy Analysis,Social Justice,Climate Change,Energy Policy,,,,"The great net-zero balancing act: ambition, durability, credibility and justice in local climate emergency responses",https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65144&EventID=185
0,"Large-scale reform of electoral systems is associated with changes in party system. Over the past decade more focus has been on what impact such reforms have on MP behaviour, especially in terms of speech-making. In this paper speech-making in the Danish Parliament 1901-1939 is examined. Elections to the lower chamber underwent a reform in 1918-20 from single-member plurality to proportional representation, while indirect elections to the upper chamber remained unchanged. The focus of the paper is what the reform meant for how often MPs spoke and on what topics. It is examined whether the reform had an impact on how parties divided the responsibilities for policy areas among its members. Given that the reform was implemented in 1918 in the Capital region of Copenhagen and in 1920 across the entire country it is also explored whether those members with earlier experience of proportional representation saw an earlier change in behaviour. The findings are compared with speech-making in the upper chamber where given its unchanged electoral system we should not expect to see any change in speech-making. The analysis is further supported by text-analysis of specific debates before and after the electoral system change. Overall, the findings in the paper is that there was a clear impact on speech-making in that MPs with smaller majorities after the reform spoke more often and on more topics. This shows that they reacted to intra-party competition which was less important prior to the reform.",Brunel University,,,,,,,,Brunel University,,Martin Ejnar Hansen,,,,,,,,Martin Ejnar Hansen,,Elections,Parliaments,Political Parties,,,,,,The Impact of Electoral Reform on Parliamentary Behaviour,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=62692&EventID=185

Since these ties might nonetheless constitute a relevant way for interest groups to lobby parliament from within, sideline activities have recently received a lot of negative attention in the press and in the German public. Voters fear their representatives no longer act in the electors' interest but rather stand up for either their own profits or those of powerful corporations. In addition to that, although there is evidence that members of parliament (MPs) represent their affiliated interests in parliament, studies of the formal ties of German MPs to organized interests are still scarce.

Addressing this research gap, our proposed paper aims to analyze how interest affiliations of members of the German Bundestag impact on their political careers. On the one hand, we understand political careers as parliamentary leadership positions such as membership in parliamentary party groups' (PPG) executive committees, PPG's working groups and sections, party spokespersons in committees, and committee chairs. On the other hand, we survey the assignment to committees. Committee work can enable MPs to influence policies as the Bundestag's legislative capacities are grounded in its committee system that allows for the review of bills.

We define interest affiliations as (vocational or honorary) functions in organizations and corporations, carried out by MPs, as well as sideline activities during the term of office. Since these are liable to publication on the Bundestag's website, we collected them for the 19th German Bundestag (2017–2021) which resulted in a database of 3763 interest affiliations for all MPs combined. We then estimate the impact of interest affiliations on leadership positions and committee assignments in the Bundestag by means of a regression analysis, while also considering MPs' individual biographic information, manner of election, and length of term as potential confounders.

By combining literature on organized interests with studies on political representation and legislative organization, our analysis adds to the research on interest group studies as well as on parliaments and the understudied role of individual parliamentarians.

We then estimate the impact of interest affiliations on leadership positions and committee assignments in the Bundestag by means of a regression analysis, while also considering MPs' individual biographic information, manner of election, and length of term as potential confounders.

By combining literature on organized interests with studies on political representation and legislative organization, our analysis adds to the research on interest group studies as well as on parliaments and the understudied role of individual parliamentarians. Both the study of politicians' career paths and research on committee assignments lack an explicit focus on interest organizations and outside affiliations as explanatory variables. Our analysis provides this focus and highlights the implications of MPs carrying interest ties into legislative committees and using them to further their parliamentary careers.",Ruhr-Universität Bochum,Ruhr-Universität Bochum,,,,,,,Ruhr-Universität Bochum,,Pauline Büsken,Florian Spohr,,,,,,,Pauline Büsken,,Interest Groups,Parliaments,Representation,Lobbying,,,,,The Impact of German MPs' Interest Affiliations on their Parliamentary Careers,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64424&EventID=185
0,"The shift towards rail is an important factor for reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the transport sector. In many cases, new or renewed railway infrastructure is needed for such a shift, especially in regional transport. Recent developments show that rail infrastructure projects are often initiated at local level, by parliaments and governments or independent citizen initiatives. Drawing upon knowledge about the influence of digital infrastructure on social capital, we assume that transport infrastructure has a more encompassing effect on regional development, covering social identity and political participation in addition to economic effects. Using data from an online thought experiment about different forms of local rail access and an ordered probit model approach, we find that knowledge about successful reactivations of rail infrastructures increases regional identification as well as trust in the democratic process. Knowledge about successful citizen initiatives in this context amplifies such trust in particular. Furthermore, acceptance of state expenditure for rail infrastructure increases as well. The results have important implications for public policy strategies and local politics regarding the strengthening of sustainable modes of transport such as rail, against the backdrop of climate change.",German Centre for Rail Traffic Research,,,,,,,,German Centre for Rail Traffic Research,,Regina Weber,,,,,,,,Regina Weber,,Civil Society,Local Government,Climate Change,Experimental Design,Survey Experiments,,,,"The impact of rail infrastructure on regional identity, participation and development – Evidence from a thought-experiment",https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63131&EventID=185
0,"The European Strategic Autonomy concept became a buzzword in 2016 after the European Union released “A Global Strategy for the European Union’s Foreign and Security Policy” instantly after the BREXIT. The increasing international uncertainty, changing relations with the United States of America, and new security challenges put ESA at the front of the EU agenda. As a result, European Strategic Autonomy became extremely topical among EU policymakers, politicians, think-tankers, and the academic community, gaining proponents and opponents at the same time. Unfortunately, the growing intensity of discussions on European Strategic Autonomy contributed little to its precision. 
The archaeology of the concept suggests that the European Strategic Autonomy’s origins can be traced back to the first initiatives of Western European countries to cooperate in defense policies after World War II. Since then, the concept deepened and expanded at varying rates and success because it was heavily affected by two main variables: the systemic processes and positions of member states of European Communities and, later European Union. 
Considering the two mentioned variables, the analysis of the evolution of the concept allows defining how precisely those independent variables impacted the development of European Strategic Autonomy and its substance. Furthermore, it also indicates what can be expected from European Strategic Autonomy, assuming that the future can be extrapolated from historical patterns and examples.",General Jonas Žemaitis Military Academy of Lithuania,,,,,,,,General Jonas Žemaitis Military Academy of Lithuania,,Giedrius Cesnakas,,,,,,,,Giedrius Cesnakas,,European Union,Integration,NATO,Security,Member States,,,,The Impact of Systemic and National Variables on the Substance of the European Strategic Autonomy,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63156&EventID=185
0,"In recent years many European parliamentary democracies experienced the weakening of party government, indicated by the cabinets, increasingly filled with non-partisan technocrats without parliamentary background (Pinto, Cotta & de Almeida 2018). This paper aims to answer the question whether and how the ‘technocratisation’ of the executive affects the relationship between the executive and the legislature. The existing research predicts that technocratic government changes the patterns of behaviour in the legislature. The principal-agent theory predicts that non-partisan ministers pose a greater risk of agency-loss for a party responsible for the making of the cabinet (Saalfeld 2000; Strøm 1995). The uncertainty about the preferences of non-partisan ministers leads to an increased scrutiny of executive by the leaders and backbenchers of the parties of a governing coalition, though the level of the scrutiny might be moderated by other factors (Bundi 2018; Camerlo & Pérez-Liñán 2015; King, 1976; Maor 1999). Case study of the technical government led by Monti in Italy shows that the behaviour of opposition parties and inter-party relationship might be affected, as well (Marangoni & Verzichelli 2015; Zulianello 2013). Yet the question remains how well these observations travel across different parliamentary systems.
To test the theoretical predictions about the effects of technocratic government, this paper conducts the content analysis of the parliamentary questions (PQ), asked orally during 88 “government’s hours” in Lithuanian parliament in 2016-2020 when the government was led by the prime-minister Skvernelis. Skvernelis’s cabinet is particularly suitable for analysis because for more than half of its term it was composed of mainly non-partisan ministers, while eventually a number of non-partisan ministers were replaced by partisan ministers. Therefore, the observed change of PQ pattern can be with higher certainty attributed to the changing composition of the executive, and not to the general characteristics of the parliament.
The coding of PQ was based on the coding framework developed by Maricut‐Akbik (2021), which relates the types of questions to different degrees of scrutiny strength, though the framework was adapted to Lithuanian context to better reflect the variation of speech acts performed by asking parliamentary questions (Russo & Wiberg 2010). The data shows that: (a) non-partisan ministers tend to be challenged by the backbenchers of the party, which delegated them, more often than partisan ministers. The latter are supported by the party even despite negative public opinion. This observation leads to the inference that MPs identify with policies by unpopular ministers, delegated by the party, only if the ministers are party members; (b) opposition MPs tend to focus more on policy principles than on the lack of competence and quality of decisions when scrutinizing non-partisan ministers and vice versa for partisan ministers. The typical line of challenge to the policies of non-partisan ministers by the opposition MPs is that the policies do not conform to the principles and promises of the party which delegated them, thus challenging the connections between governing coalition and its cabinet.",Vilnius University,,,,,,,,Vilnius University,,Inga Vinogradnaitė,,,,,,,,Inga Vinogradnaitė,,Democracy,Executives,Parliaments,Political Leadership,,,,,The impact of technocratic government on the relationship between the legislature and the executive: evidence from Lithuania,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64099&EventID=185
0,"The impacts of the 2015 refugee crisis on immigration and integration policies of national parties in multi-party systems across Europe have drawn the attention of various scholars. In reaction to increased refugee-inflows the political landscape across different countries has seen mechanisms of transformation and adaption. As this event created unique conditions for national party competition, I propose that mechanisms of cohesion and polarization were set into motion considering party type, governmental position, and previous positional shifts. To test my arguments, I present a novel approach to estimate party positions on issue-specific topics. Using a supervised machine learning approach, utilizing manually coded immigration and integration categories based on the Comparative Manifesto Project, I apply multiple binary text classification models to identify additional and previously unidentified topic-related text passages within party manifestos from 2005-2020. In the next step, I run Wordfish and Wordscores models on this newly generated text corpus to estimate individual national party positions on immigration- and integration-issues. The results provide a novel dataset of topic specific positions of national parties, supporting the effectiveness of supervised text analysis on small amounts of ideologically loaded textual data. Finally, I analyse the cross-national determinants of positional shifts in the wake of the refugee crisis. The results give insight how parties adapt their positions in response to this unique event with respect to the dynamics it created in relation to party-systemic and party-specific preconditions.",University of Strathclyde,,,,,,,,University of Strathclyde,,Thomas Schober,,,,,,,,Thomas Schober,,Europe (Central and Eastern),Integration,Party Manifestos,Political Competition,Political Parties,Immigration,Quantitative,Decision Making,The impact of the 2015 refugee crisis on the positional decision-making processes of political parties in multi-party systems across Europe,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63654&EventID=185

Previous research has highlighted the saliency of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict particularly among Muslims both in and outside of the Middle East. Our research design, which oversamples the Muslim minority, enables us to investigate and compare the effects of this conflict episode on attitudes of both the majority and the minority population in Germany. Results of the natural experiment indicate that the violent escalation between Palestinian Jihadi groups from the Gaza-Strip and the Israeli Defense Forces during May 2021 have significantly increased anti-Semitic sentiments among respondents. Surprisingly, these effects were particularly pronounced among the majority population but not among Muslim respondents. Moreover, this conflict episode deteriorated attitudes of respondents who self-identified as moderates but not of those who are at the extreme ends of the ideological spectrum.",Universität Hamburg,WZB Berlin Social Science Center,German Institute for Global And Area Studies,Universität Hamburg,,,,,Universität Hamburg,,Katrin Brettfeld,Eylem Kanol,Thomas Richter,Peter Wetzels,,,,,Katrin Brettfeld,,Extremism,International,Public Opinion,Survey Experiments,,,,,The impact of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict on intergroup attitudes in Germany: Evidence from a natural experiment,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65134&EventID=185

This process has included the establishment and capacitation of independent regulatory agencies (IRAs) and an overhaul of the regulatory framework as part of a better regulation agenda. Fifteen years on, the time seems apt to review how the ongoing regulatory reform has impacted the autonomy of regulators, and their power relations  vis-a-vis the state and businesses. The analysis draws on primary and secondary literature and interviews with informed stakeholders from regulators from several sectors. The focus is on exploring whether the changing institutional arrangements around the role of the state, business, and regulators in regulatory policies has led to a transformation of their power relations in exerting de facto influence over regulatory policy.  Findings are discussed with reference to debates around factual vs legal independence of regulators, and wider debates around the changing nature of the regulatory state, particularly in contexts dominated by cultures of informality and traditionally strong state’s role in economy.",University of York,"Faculty of Political Science, University of Belgrade",,,,,,,University of York,,Slobodan Tomic,Ognjen Dragichevic,,,,,,,Slobodan Tomic,,Public Administration,Public Policy,Regulation,,,,,,"The impact of transitional regulatory reform on the power relations between the state, business, and regulators: A case study of Serbian regulatory reform (2005-2020)",https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64253&EventID=185

0,"With roughly 11 million official cases and more than96,000 casualties up to the moment, Spain is oneof the EU countries that has been worst affected by COVID-19. In 2020, Spain’s economy shrank by 10.8%, almost doubling the average in the EU (-6%), and working hours for the equivalent of 2 million of jobs were lost.
We had juststarted to develop two research projects on citizen participation at the local level in two Spanish regions when the WHO declared Covid-19 a global pandemic. Both projects, combined the use of quantitative (web surveys) and qualitative methods (case studies) to analyse the links between ideology of the governing party and the development of citizen participation experiences at the local level and the performance of Advisory Councils (AC) at the regional and local level, respectively. We included the effects of the pandemic related restrictions on citizen participation as a second research question in both projects, with several questions in the questionnaires (N=622 and N=380) and some attention devoted to this issue in the in-depth,semi-structured interviews with officials (N=27) and AC members (N=35).
The aim of this paper is twofold: firstly, we use these data to describe what are the main effects of the pandemic on citizen participation at the local level according to two of its main actors(public participation officers and members of advisory councils),and how do they assess the overall impact of the pandemic. Secondly, we focus on the differences in the evaluation on the impact of the pandemic. Are there practitioners’ profiles or participation arenas that have been less affected by this crisis?

0,"We start from the observation that transboundary crises repeatedly lead to the strengthening of some IGOs while weakening others, at least temporarily. This variance is puzzling for extant theorizations that show an almost binary division in theoretical expectations of crisis-induced empowerment or disempowerment of IGOs, without accounting for the other outcome, respectively. We develop a theoretical argument to account for variation both across and within IGOs over time. At the macro-level, we posit that global governance arrangements exhibit elasticity: while some IGOs in a given governance space contract due to crisis pressures, this opens the way for others to expand. When the crisis abates, however, the weakened organizations reemerge and the strengthened ones retract, albeit imperfectly so. At the micro-level, we explain which IGOs are likely to initially contract or expand and why. We argue that IGO focality and crisis intensity are the main factors mediating crisis pressures from contentious politicization. When crisis intensity is high and an IGO is focal, we expect its contraction: It will be at the center of attention and attract contradictory demands and blame that hinder a collaborative and assertive response. A non-focal IGO will be less affected by such restrictions. Flying under the radar of public attention, such IGOs find themselves able to at least temporarily expand into policy areas left ungoverned by focal IGOs. When crisis intensity decreases, we expect focal IGOs to reclaim their sphere of authority and non-focal IGOs to fall back into their core business, both leaving institutional traces, however, that preempt a complete return to the status quo ante. To test the plausibility of this mechanistic argument, we apply it to the case of IGO reactions to the COVID-19 crisis. We study the mechanisms of expansion and contraction in four global and regional, focal and non-focal IGOs: WHO, EU, WFP and NATO.",Friedrich-Schiller Universität Jena,European University Institute,,,,,,,Friedrich-Schiller Universität Jena,,Christian Kreuder-Sonnen,Stephanie Hofmann,,,,,,,Christian Kreuder-Sonnen,,Governance,Institutions,Global,,,,,,The imperfect elasticity of global governance: IGO crisis responses between expansion and contraction,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63388&EventID=185

0,"Most of the elections are held according to proportional electoral system in the Czech Republic (the exceptions are the Senate elections and the direct presidential election). At the local level, municipal elections are held according to the same rules, despite the extreme fragmentation of local government here. Regardless the rules favouring political parties, independent local lists win in most municipalities. In many cases it is a victory without losers because only a single list competes in the election. Low competitiveness of elections in municipalities negatively affects electoral participation in Czechia. Municipal size presents a paradoxical trade-off in the relationship between maximizing two dimensions of local democracy: participation and competition. Moreover, the confusing electoral system often produces unexpected results at the local level. Individual single candidates have the most demanding conditions for election. However, if only individual single candidates run for office the list proportional electoral system is effectively informally transformed into a majoritarian system. Every four years, voters in hundreds of Czech municipalities, usually very small ones, elect their representatives in this non-standard way. The election results in these cases directly express voter preferences, as they are not distorted when converting votes into seats. A paper looks at both the possible factors leading to elections without lists of candidates, as well as the effects on voter turnout, etc. The analysis of various statistical data is used, as well as interviews with representatives of selected municipalities to understand the contexts where such paradoxical transformations of formal rules happens and how it affects competition, voter turnout, etc.",Palacký University,,,,,,,,Palacký University,,Dan Ryšavý,,,,,,,,Dan Ryšavý,,Europe (Central and Eastern),Elections,Local Government,Political Competition,Electoral Behaviour,,,,The inconspicuous charm of local democracy.

The goal is to study to what extent constitutional review contributes to parliament’s consensus building or on the contrary if parties uses it as an electoral weapon. Theoretical models have described a potential “auto-limitation” behavior in parties induced by court aversion attitudes -scholars suppose high costs from vetoing a law- that could favor inter-
party agreements. Yet, there are no systematic empirical analyses on this question due to data
limitations. Based in web scrapping, text parsing and text-reuse methods different data-sets are built, which allow us to monitor every party’s decision regarding each bill along the legislative
process -including the potential court revision-. In addition to data on the characteristics of individual judges, the court plenary composition and cases of abstract review the paper considers data on bill’s proposals and the amendatory process –number and type of amendments, and whether they are incorporated into final legislation- to measure the parties' movements through its policy positions. As exploratory variables, we take into consideration the court ideological composition, internal dynamics and working procedures, as well as contextual factors, such as the politicization of issue and the government and parliamentary geometry.

0,"My presentation falls within the literature on the influence of far-right anti-immigrant movements. My aim is to measure the extent to which far-right ideas are gaining popularity among more moderate sections of civil society (Kallis 2013 p.225). To do so, I take an original approach: while the current literature has mostly focused on the analysis of public policies (Abou Chadi 2016), electoral voting (Norris 2005), and political party programs (Richardson and Colombo 2014), I focus on analysis of public debate. Analyzing public debate is crucial to understanding the influence of ideas, and to going beyond the formal negotiations and political game of party politics. I try to identify how ideas that can be categorized as originally belonging to the “extreme right” are nowadays taken up and discussed in the French national press.

In order to do this, I focus on the use of the notion of the “great replacement”, known to be promoted by the most radical fringes of the French far-right movement (Camus and Lebourg 2015; Crépon et al 2015). I will analyze how this notion has been interpreted in public debate. This notion of the “great replacement”, developed by the essay writer Renaud Camus, postulates the existence of a deliberate process of substitution of the French and European population by a non-European population, mostly originating from sub Saharan Africa and North Africa. Analysis of the use of the term “great replacement” is therefore crucial for measuring how ideas which have long been on the far right of the political spectrum are gaining popularity among more moderate sections of civil society (Kallis 2013 p.225).

I choose to focus on the case of France because this country is home to an extreme right-wing party, the Rassemblement National (formerly Front National), which has achieved constant electoral success for more than thirty years (Rydgren 2004), without establishing any alliances with mainstream right-wing political parties to participate in governments at the national level. It will therefore be interesting to analyze to what extent this political party, formally excluded from power and government coalitions, nevertheless manages to inject some of its ideas into the national public debate, beyond the circle of its supporters. 

How is the term “great replacement” perceived in the national press? Is the term considered to be a relevant description of the demographic evolution of the country, by pundits, journalists, and political figures outside the circle of far-right supporters? Who, on the contrary, considers that the term has a strong racist and xenophobic dimension? The objectives of my presentation are threefold: 1) to understand the progression and influence of far-right ideas on public debate; 2) to grasp the ideological conflicts stemming from the growing ethnocultural diversity of the French population; 3) to better apprehend the ideological dividing lines that split French society.","Université du Québec à Montréal, Canada.",,,,,,,,"Université du Québec à Montréal, Canada.",,Paul May,,,,,,,,Paul May,,Extremism,Media,National Identity,Identity,Qualitative,Political Ideology,,,The influence of far-right in the French public debate: the (unexpected?) success of the notion of the « Great Replacement ».,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64285&EventID=185
0,"The search for the right answers to the climate crisis has now been on the international political agenda for over four decades. During this time, governments have more or less continuously tried to meet the challenge of climate change by finding solutions to reduce emissions at the global and national level. These measures did not come out of the blue, but were the result of increasing climate awareness and the growing influence of climate movements in national societies. This is all the more true today as social media communication offers numerous opportunities through which these movements can a) attract the unfiltered attention of the general public, b) influence traditional media discourse and c) enter into direct dialogue with policy makers as they also use social media to spread their messages. This type of communication thus provides environmental groups with higher visibility, combined with better agenda-setting potential as well as better accessibility to policy-makers. The aim of this paper is to measure under which conditions this social media-based discourse translates into greater influence and political weight of the climate movement on government policy. The theory-driven empirical analysis is based on assumptions from domestic politics and issue salience research. Methodologically, it is based on the one hand on a computer-assisted content analysis of the climate discourse on Twitter and on the other hand on the reactions of government politicians on this platform and other official statements.

0,"The complexity of policy processes in scope and scale pushed the interactions of societal actors towards institutionalized governance networks with local authorities. Often encouraged by European, national and regional incentives aimed at reducing territorial inequalities, a wide range of partnerships amongst municipalities and societal actors has emerged, with different choices in terms of the architecture and intensity of local governance arrangements. These networks have been taken as a panacea to generate policies capable of boosting the development of the territory and, hence, tackle territorial inequalities. 
Despite the benefits to be gained from exploiting these state-society partnerships, it should not be disregarded that governance arrangements are very complex systems, leading to a series of decision-making, coordination, participation and management problems. Individuals and institutions engage in collective action which may also generate conflicting approaches to complex issues. 
The growing prominence of local governance networks has sparked significant academic interest, but existent research tends to be focused on the institutional and external aspects of the phenomenon, largely disregarding state-society partnerships’ inner functioning and dynamics. In a context where strategic direction and effective leadership are needed to foster broader cooperation between local authorities and a wider set of stakeholders, the complexity of institutionalized governance networks and the role of societal actors at the local level must be assessed. 
This paper aims to explore the perceptions of different actors across diverse typologies of networks – created either by a mandate from the central government (top-down) or created by the initiative of local governments or other local actors (bottom-up). Perceptions on coordination, capacity and accountability are discussed based on an empirical analysis of 127 semi-structured interviews with mayors, and representatives of relevant local stakeholders involved in 49 local governance arrangements in Portugal.",Universidade de Aveiro,Universidade de Aveiro,Universidade de Aveiro,Universidade de Aveiro,,,,,Universidade de Aveiro,,Alexandre Rosa,Patrícia Silva,Filipe Teles,Raquel Valentim,,,,,Raquel Valentim,,Democracy,Governance,Local Government,Policy-Making,,,,,The inner life of local governance arrangements,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65470&EventID=185
0,"With the rise of globalisation, states increasingly find it necessary to rely on transnational non-binding regulations to deal with matters that were previously domestic in nature. While intergovernmentalism can enable positive regulatory outcomes by providing collaborative solutions to global challenges, states often have no alternative but to comply. In certain circumstances, the ‘voluntary’ nature of intergovernmental regulation is, in reality, mandatory. While political scientists observed its emergence in the 1970s, today intergovernmentalism is rapidly becoming the most widespread and effective mode of international governance. Compliance with these non-binding norms allows states to fully enjoy the advantages of globalisation and to avoid the race to the (regulatory) bottom. With regard to investments, environmental issues, labour and banking, states comply with non-binding regulations in order to avoid the negative economic and political side-effects that come with non- compliance. Anti-money laundering, counter-terrorist financing, food safety, technical and organisational standards, environmental reporting, and international financial reporting standards are all examples of fields that are regulated, to some extent, by intergovernmental organisations. 

The organisations that oportes in the said fields are, theoretically, capable of setting only soft-law standards and recommendations. However, in reality, they often leaves no practical choice for states but to conform with the standards or risk their reputation under pressures that are unlikely to be indefinitely withstood. This reality is problematic from the perspective of democratic accountability, the legitimacy of domestic legislative processes, and respect for the fundamental international law principle of state sovereignty. It is also emblematic of an emerging trend towards increasingly transnational regulation and governance. Therefore, it is essential that democratic jurisdictions strengthen their separation of powers framework and defends democratic governance. 

In this presentation, we propose that the formal introduction of a fourth arm of government in the form of an integrity branch could facilitate this objective, strengthen the doctrine of separation of powers, and bolster states’ engagement with transnational governance and regulation. There is an urgent need for action on this issue as the shift to transnational governance, along with the increasing power of intergovernmental organisations, is a rapidly accelerating trend in international relations and a key feature of the global regulatory regime today.",University of York,,,,,,,,University of York,,Slobodan Tomic,,,,,,,,Slobodan Tomic,,Institutions,Regulation,Ethics,,,,,,"The integrity branch - fourth branch of government  (*** Authors are: Dr Doron Goldbarsht and Dr Hannah Harris,  from Macquarie Law School, but provisionally registered under S Tomic name until authors' ECPR registration emails are sorted****",https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65707&EventID=185

At the hearth of this paradox lies the widespread understanding that populist success is always predicated on some sort of representative crisis, a failure of the political establishment to represent the interests, fulfill the demands of its constituency (Hawkins & Rovira Kaltwasser 2019; Roberts 2015; Stavrakakis 2017). But how can populists in power rely on the same type of representative crisis to maintain their populist legitimacy? Why do voters continue to support populists in power despite this radical change in their status as elite power-holders?

This paper proposes to resolve the paradox of populist persistence in power by critically revisiting what representative crisis means, how populists use it to mobilize support, and how such crises contribute to the populist attitudes of individuals on the mass level. The paper puts forward a theoretical argument that places the concept of populism within the domain of political representation, and in the footsteps of scholars who see populism as a political or social logic (Laclau, 2005; Stavrakakis, 2017), a form of representation (Caramani, 2017) or a type of representation (Urbinati, 2019), proposes that populism is one of multiple existing logics of political representation. The core argument of the paper is that populist success depends on an immanent crisis of other, non-populist logics of political representation. Representative crises, seen as political performances (Moffitt 2016), can be successfully performed both from opposition and power because they are based not on the failure of representation in general, nor on the failure of the incumbent political actors, but on the assumed failure of non-populist representative logics. 

To support this argument, the paper reviews existing explanations of populist persistence in power, engages with arguments that link populism to political representation, and revisits what the most used characteristics of populism, “people-centrism”, “anti-elitism” and “anti-pluralism” mean for a representative logic. To distinguish populist representation from its opposites, the paper puts forward a typology of representative logics along two dimensions, an ontological and a structural one, which strongly build on the literature about the trustee and delegate models of representative action, and on the discursive theories of populist group identity formation. Finally, the paper offers a brief discussion of what the proposed typology of representative logics means for key arguments prevalent in populism theory: the argument about populism’s majoritarian quality, the moral dimension of the people-elite dichotomy, and the relationship between representative logics and (thick) ideologies.

0,"The increasing tension between calls for a yet-to-be-achieved full integration of LGBTQ+ into the public space, and claims for a broader religious freedom is a touch-and-go in the US and European public discourse. It emphasizes the need for a balance between religious exercise, in its individual and collective dimension, the rule of law and third-party burdens. A crucial issue concerns the impact of religiously-based conscientious claims on the implementation of non-discrimination narrative. In many legal contexts the reconciliation of a right to equal dignity of members of the LGBTQ+ community and the fundamental right to religious exercise is grounded on a fragmentary legal framework. Thus, the judiciary has been often entrusted with the task to reach a difficult balance between competing interests.  
The implementation of public policies aimed at preserving pluralism and democracy requires not only a careful negotiation between the protagonists but also a strong commitment of public and religious actors. As far as they are concerned, the new challenge for religious organizations is to keep up with their religious identity while including stakeholders with different sets of values. Ethical and moral issue are the object of a process of rebranding in many religious traditions, with a view to adopting increasing solicitude toward the most socially vulnerable groups of people, for instance LGBTQ+ people. Recent theological-juridical arguments have re-interpreted sacred texts, in the pursuit of the restoration of their genuine message of equality, favoring the development of more progressive trends within religious traditions toward gender identity and sexual orientation issues.
The aim of the paper is to investigate 1) the development of new narratives and public policies that can be implemented nationally and supranationally to reconcile religious freedom and LGBTQ+ rights 2) the increasing pressure on religious conservative organizations to make their sets of values flexible enough to accommodate LGBTQ+ claims 3) the limits religious groups (even religious minorities) face in dealing with the new gender challenges and the strategies they lay out to overcome them.",University of Messina,,,,,,,,University of Messina,,ADELAIDE MADERA,,,,,,,,ADELAIDE MADERA,,Conflict Resolution,Gender,Public Policy,Religion,,,,,The interplay between gender issues and religious narratives: plural normativities and new political-legal insights,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64376&EventID=185

0,"In the past three decades new tasks and responsibilities have been decentralised onto the Icelandic local level. The local government system is synchronised as all local authorities are by law supposed to provide their citizens with the same type of services irrespective of size. Currently the municipal size ranges between 40 and 130000 citizens. The heavy emphasis on decentralization has also led to a flood of largely voluntary amalgamations in the past decades. Again, leading to problems for many newly established municipalities as they struggle to provide services to a vast territory with a low population density. Concurrently this has also led to many communities feeling left out and alienated within the new municipality leading to feelings of low levels of democratic legitimacy in many newly established municipalities. To tackle this problem a new type of municipality with sub-municipal units was established for the first time in October 2020. There a large municipality in the rural east of Iceland was amalgamated with three very small municipalities. In each of the original four municipalities a sub-municipal council was established with a mixture of directly and indirectly elected members. They were given responsibilities in the field of local planning as well in issues directly concerning individual communities such as opening hours of recreational facilities. The paper explores the first evidence of the success of  the experiment of applying asynchronized measures in a largely synchronised system, based on survey data collected in March 2022. A survey was sent to all members of the local council as well as the four individual community councils. In addition, the survey was sent to key members of the public administration.",University of Iceland,,,,,,,,University of Iceland,,Eva Marín Hlynsdóttir,,,,,,,,Eva Marín Hlynsdóttir,,Local Government,Public Administration,Political Engagement,,,,,,The introduction of sub-municipal units in Iceland: the first evidence,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64304&EventID=185
0,"The theoretical possibility of benign despotism plays a crucial role in many influential arguments in contemporary political philosophy. For instance, democratic theorists appeal to the counterfactual figure of the benevolent dictator to reject instrumental defences of democracy, while theorists of self-determination appeal to the counterfactual figure of the benevolent colonizer to motivate the value of self-determination.

We argue that this argumentative strategy is not as benign as the non-existent despots upon which it depends. The appeal to hypothetical benevolent dictators and colonizers usually serves to demonstrate the intrinsic value of collective self-rule. If basic rights and other goods could (theoretically) be secured through authoritarian or colonial rule, then democracy and self-determination cannot be robustly justified on the basis of their tendency to generate such goods. Instead, we must turn to accounts that emphasize the intrinsic value of self-rule.

In our view, this sort of argument forestalls one sort of contingency only by exacerbating another. Undeniably, defending democratic and self-governing institutions for their ability to generate certain goods (or forestall certain evils) makes their value contingent on empirical regularities. In practice, however, we argue that the regularities in question are historically robust, and thus not fragile in the way that the language of contingency implies. Meanwhile, arguments that rely on the supposedly more robust logic of self-rule are also contingent in a different, and not obviously less important, way. In particular, they rely on the assumption that the values appealed to justify collective self-rule, such as individual autonomy, are universally shared. But these values are not necessarily widely endorsed across cultures. In that sense, they are not so robust after all. By contrast, the normative concerns captured by instrumentalist accounts are far more widely shared.  

Furthermore, we argue that there are several overlooked dangers associated with this common argumentative move. First, it shifts our attention away from the concrete harms done by actual dictators and colonizers. Relatedly, it implicitly concedes ground to those who deny this fact, in a way that is clearly problematic in other contexts. For example, we ought not concede to “scientific racism” claims regarding natural inferiority in an effort to defend unconditional equality. Some grounds should not be conceded even for the sake of argument, and we argue that the hypothetical erasure of violence and abuse under colonial and despotic rule is one such instance. 

Finally, it implies that an entire category of reasons that have motivated resistance against despotic rule is simply mistaken—or, at least, not worthy of philosophical uptake. Though the intrinsic value of self-rule undoubtedly motivated some anticolonial and democratic movements, many were motivated also—if not primarily—by concerns such as poverty, inequality, repression, dispossession, and cultural or actual genocide. We argue that it would be a serious mistake to ignore the actual motivations and perspectives of oppressed political actors in our accounts of the values and institutions they have fought to achieve. We conclude with broader reflections on the use of history and empirics in normative political theory.",University of South Carolina,University of Oxford,,,,,,,University of Oxford,,Samuel Bagg,Shuk Ying Chan,,,,,,,Shuk Ying Chan,,Democracy,Political Theory,Realism,Normative Theory,,,,,The irrelevance of benevolence: on the role of benign despots in political theory,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65458&EventID=185
0,"Theoretical models of political agency primarily incorporate elected executives’ self-interest as motivating reelection-seeking behavior, which, in turn, keeps these politicians in check. A concerning trend of democratic backsliding highlights that these models fail to capture populist elected executives who target democracy-protection mechanisms, minorities, and civil society organizations using discriminatory treatment, for example, on the basis of gender, age, religion, sexual orientation, and funding sources. Against this background, I develop the Ladder of Discriminatory Policy, which is conceptualized along two dimensions, namely the scope of target populations and the level of policy tool calibration in the design of discriminatory policies. I tie climbing and descending this modular ladder to system-level policy punctuations; to the discriminatory effects of policies on politically relevant target groups; and to elected executives’ progression between three self-interest constructs with varying levels of self-interest intensity. I explore socio-psychological, institutional, and political mechanisms that may facilitate this progression.",Hebrew University of Jerusalem,,,,,,,,Hebrew University of Jerusalem,,Moshe Maor,,,,,,,,Moshe Maor,,Elites,Political Psychology,Populism,Public Policy,Decision Making,Policy Change,Policy-Making,Theoretical,The Ladder of Discriminatory Policy: A Framework for the Systemic Classification of Discriminatory Policy Types,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63259&EventID=185
0,"The ‘refugee studies’ literature has largely examined the question of legal implementation through its practice: the words and gestures of bureaucrats. This paper, which is broadly methodological, seeks to question the translation of scriptural signs (legal texts) into empirical forms (transit camps for exiles). The etymology of ‘implementation’ invites the research to broaden its object from human action to material fill up. The words of the law fill the world with exile camps; it is this performativity that must be accounted for.
Through a case study: the specifications of a new type of transit camp in France for the reception of exiles has produced thirty-three such camps. We will seek to measure the implementation through material data: the site and location of these camps, their architecture, the objects and documents found there. The virtues of this methodological approach (inspired by historical research) are that it (a) allows for greater comparability, with objectifiable data on the accommodation space, the measurement of places, their dissimilarities and their convergence; (b) reaches directly into the living environment of the recipients of this policy - rather than their face-to-face interactions with agents.
These recently created camps (2018), which have been scattered throughout France, provide a particular case study that will give methodological ideas for comparison with transnational fields. The paper will be based on legal sources, an eight-month ethnography in one of these camps as well as interviews and photographs of a dozen camps in France.",Sciences Po Paris,,,,,,,,Sciences Po Paris,,Maxime Christophe,,,,,,,,Maxime Christophe,,Migration,Asylum,Policy Implementation,Refugee,,,,,The law and the camps.

0,"In response to extreme conditions, extraordinary powers are assumed by a government in the form of a state of exception. Adhering to the necessities present, the state of exception allows for actions beyond the scope of a set up legal order and its norms. The modern state of exception appears to elude any juridical explanation to justify its legality. On this point, theorist Giorgio Agamben questions the presumption of the state of exception being predominantly an issue of fact. The parallels drawn between the state of exception and the state of necessity lead Agamben to begin his study with the analysis of the legal concept of necessity. The medieval theoretic works of Gratian and Thomas Aquinas appear to set the foundations of this parallel. Both the concept of necessity and the modern state of exception appear to rely upon the presumption of “pure factuality”, as an objective given. A reliance, which appears to pose a threat to any legal order, as it may allow for a government to act beyond the premise of a set up legal order.   

The Swiss Vollmachtenregime of 1914 provides for a unique insight into determining to what extent the modern state of exception is reliant on the concept of necessity. The Swiss state of exception would endure its most serious challenge by the Social Democratic Party of Switzerland, with its members Ernest Paul Graber and Robert Grimm arguing against its necessity. Necessity in this instance appears to exist far from an objective given. Similarly, the Swiss Epidemics Act of 2012 and its subsequent application during the outbreak of the Coronavirus health crisis in 2020 provide for a further insight into understanding the parallels between the state of exception and the concept of necessity. Extraordinary measures would be implemented pursuant to the Act’s Article 7. The legality of these extraordinary measures appears to be justified by a determination of necessity. 

The main objective of this paper will be to present how Agamben questions the grounding of the state of exception into the concept of necessity. In presenting the arguments and developments from the Swiss political reality, this paper will be allowed to pursue its second objective and attempt to uncover the degree to which the concept of necessity is the basis of the state of exception. The final objective will be to assess whether the parallels between the state of exception and the concept of necessity may undermine a legal order. To reduce the legality of a state of exception to a subjective interpretation of necessity, would appear to pave the pathway to a reality whereby “almost anything [would be] possible [to any government] by means of a situation-specific interpretation” of ‘law’.",Charles University,,,,,,,,Charles University,,Alexander Carl Dinopoulos,,,,,,,,Alexander Carl Dinopoulos,,,,,,,,,,The Legality of Necessity in the State of Exception; Agamben via Bern,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=66319&EventID=185

It is a constitutional tool to remove power-hungry presidents who threaten democracy, disrespect the law, or are involved in cases of corruption or scandalous behaviour. However, impeachment also opens the door to partisan and opportunistic interests. Since re-democratization in the 1970s and 1980s, 24 Latin American presidents failed to complete their constitutionally fixed terms, often due to serious developments in the economy, social mobilisations, and political scandals. In at least ten of these episodes, legislators used impeachment or impeachment-like procedures to dismiss the president. Analysing the last set of impeachments –those occurring in Latin America since 2012– we show that the political use of impeachments has become the norm, but their use has been unable to provide the expected answers and has often fed ongoing crises with further disenchantment and political instability.",German Institute for Global And Area Studies,Universitetet i Bergen,,,,,,,German Institute for Global And Area Studies,,Mariana Llanos,Leiv Marsteintredet,,,,,,,Mariana Llanos,,Executives,Government,Institutions,Latin America,Parliaments,Developing World Politics,,,The limits of presidential impeachment in Latin America,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63976&EventID=185
0,"The UN human rights treaty bodies – expert bodies that monitor how states implement their obligations under the global human rights conventions – are frequently referred to as actors. But how do these bodies develop group agency? After all, this is not obvious, given that the treaty bodies suffer from resource shortcomings, possess a heterogeneous membership and comprise members that are not fully independent from the conventions’ contracting states. We argue that inward-oriented self-legitimation has an important effect on the ability of treaty bodies to become group agents. Inward-oriented self-legitimation implies that a group, or individual members, apply strategies that are to ascribe legitimacy onto the group in the eyes of the group’s members. Inward-oriented self-legitimation can have two effects: it can foster beliefs in the group’s legitimacy and thus elicit voluntary cooperation in the group, and it can provide incentives for cooperative behaviour among non-cooperative group members as obstruction and passivity become costly. We base our claim on evidence from the Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. Based on qualitative content analysis of relevant Committee documents we show that self-legitimation practices are commonplace. Based on interviews with Committee experts we provide evidence that self-legitimation has an effect on the emergence of group agency.",University of Bamberg,University of Bamberg,,,,,,,University of Bamberg,,Marlene Joger,Monika Heupel,,,,,,,Marlene Joger,,Human Rights,Institutions,UN,International,,,,,The link between self-legitimation and group agency – Evidence from the Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63447&EventID=185
0,"Multimodality describes the combination of several mobility modes and plays an essential role in the sustainable urban mobility transition and therefore, cities themselves. Mobility hubs are the physical location of changes between modes and bring forth a multi-sectoral and multi-level governance arrangement. Multiple public and private stakeholders from different political levels need to find innovative forms of cooperation. Mobility hubs also tackle the question of (re-)distribution of urban space and prioritization of environmentally friendly mobility modes. Furthermore, ensuring accessibility and usability for all potential users requires taking social aspects into account. This article asks how do organizational and ideational factors of the governance framework affect the implementation of mobility hubs and which political conclusions can be drawn from this? Academic literature on mobility hubs predominantly deals with their design and user needs, integration into urban space and environmental impact. With the given research question, this paper aims to enrich the growing literature on mobility hubs with considerations from a governance perspective. The theoretical approaches of governance arrangements and architecture will be combined with mobility culture and the new mobility paradigm. A multifaceted analytical framework allows examining different dimensions of the governance framework behind mobility hubs. Based on qualitative content analysis of local policy documents and 8-12 semi-structured expert interviews with local and regional stakeholders, two empirical examples on the local level in Brussels and Vienna will be analysed. In a broader sense, understanding the complex governance structures behind mobility hubs can enable more informed and coherent political decision-making processes and promote the sustainable urban mobility transition.",Westfälische Wilhelms-Universität Münster,,,,,,,,Westfälische Wilhelms-Universität Münster,,Julia Hansel,,,,,,,,Julia Hansel,,Environmental Policy,Governance,Local Government,Climate Change,,,,,The local governance of multimodal mobility hubs,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64638&EventID=185
0,"Women without status in Israel, that do not have access to permanent status and naturalization procedures, live at the periphery of Israeli society and suffer from exclusion, discrimination and violence. The Israeli asylum policy and the ethnocratic Citizenship and Entry into Israel Law put them at risk in the domestic, public, and employment arenas, as they are unprotected by employment laws, and deprived of access to healthcare and welfare services. Nonetheless, the proposed paper explores how emergency policies are leveraged by welfare and healthcare officials and community organizers, to expand existing infrastructures and include women without status.  The paper is based on a qualitative research project conducted between 2018 and 2019 in Haifa, a city in Northern Israel, with Palestinian women from the Occupied Palestinian Territories married to Israeli citizens, Eritrean women asylum seekers, and women from the Former Soviet Union, either trafficked in the sex industry or married to Israeli citizens. The paper analyzes the interpretative work performed by service providers, who mobilize institutional definitions and regulations of state of emergency such as intimate violence and children at-risk, to justify intervention. I argue that the complementary infrastructure that emerges is neither congruent with ethnocentric hegemonic discourses, nor strictly subverts racial formations and discourses. Rather, it emphasizes the collaborative work between women without status, state officials, and civil society actors, that emerges where formal policy fails.",University of Haifa,,,,,,,,University of Haifa,,Ruth Preser,,,,,,,,Ruth Preser,,Civil Society,Gender,Migration,Public Policy,Critical Theory,Immigration,Race,Mobilisation,The Logic of Emergency and the Emergence of Civic Infrastructures:  Services for Women without Status,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=62384&EventID=185

Though these platforms began as little more than poorly functioning mirrors of their mainstream competitors, they have grown into their own, providing a unique set of affordances with a specific, political user base in mind. In this paper, we examine two of the most successful Alt-Tech platforms: Gab, a microblogging platform, that was used by the perpetrator of the Pittsburgh Synagogue terrorist attack to post his last messages before the attack; and Odysee, a blockchain based video sharing platform, harbouring a wealth of anti-Semitic and other extremist content. We argue that both platforms represent technological as well as movement innovations, enabling content propagation with close to zero moderation. They rely on either their own servers or decentralization to shield themselves from consequences of these moderation-policies. In this paper, we conduct a qualitative analysis of the technological affordances of Gab and Odysee, comparing the market and ideology-driven features of the platforms.

0,"Existing research shows that citizens are not particularly well-informed about the federal division of powers and that their attitudes can be inconsistent (Fafard et al. 2010, Henderson et al. 2013, McGrane/Berdahl 2020). The specific conditions under which citizens express different attitudes to federalism have not yet been investigated thoroughly, however. In particular, the question arises as to what extent and under which conditions citizens resist the centralisation proposals that are repeatedly voiced in debates about governance reforms (during the current Covid-19 crisis, for instance).
We address these issues with the help of a vignette experiment implemented in an online survey among citizens in Germany that will be conducted within the framework of a research project on attitudes towards federalism in Germany and Switzerland. We ask respondents to evaluate reform proposals on four issues (e.g. education policy and anti-pandemic measures) that would involve a shift of responsibility from the regional to the national level. We focus on the effect of key arguments highlighting the pros and cons of federalism on preferences for these reform proposals. As questions of multi-level governance are generally not very salient for citizens, we expect that arguments will have a considerable influence on citizens’ preferences for centralisation. We will also test how a strong regional identity affects the processing of arguments on the pros and cons of federalism: based on the literature about motivated reasoning we expect that citizens employ strategies of selecting and interpreting information that ensure that arguments correspond to their prior beliefs (Taber & Lodge 2006). Hence, we expect individuals with strong regional identities to give more weight to arguments against centralisation. Conversely, we expect motivated reasoning to disappear when citizens’ regional identity is weak.",Universität Stuttgart,Universität Stuttgart,,,,,,,Universität Stuttgart,,Achim Hildebrandt,Eva-Maria Trüdinger,,,,,,,Achim Hildebrandt,,Federalism,Public Opinion,Survey Experiments,,,,,,The malleability of preferences for centralisation: The influence of arguments and identities,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63482&EventID=185
0,"Wind energy plays an important role for the energy transition. The technologies have become increasingly cost-competitive and policies are in place to move from fossil fuels to renewables. However, many wind energy projects result in conflicts on the local level. It is essential to gain a better understanding of the drivers and dynamics behind these. Local authorities such as politicians and city council members are key actors who can play a moderating, escalating or mediating role in conflicts around wind energy. Additionally, social norms of the community outline what a wind energy project should or ought to be like. Alongside public expectations, these norms indicate the layers to cultural dynamics and standards of a community. Wind energy projects, in this sense, carry potential for accumulating capital and are therefore a key source for distributing power.
The German Energiewende was long a role model for other countries. However, the German wind industry is currently not only facing permitting, legislation and auction-based issues, but also the acceptability of wind energy is getting more difficult. With its multi-layered development schemes, high wind power potential and complex social dimensions, Germany serves as a reference point to examine the local dynamics of wind energy development. German federal states set their own guidelines and requirements to regulate wind energy siting. One regulatory path to overcome acceptance problems is to determine requirements for proximity from residential areas. As an example, after the implementation of the 10H regulation in Bavaria, the number of new constructions decreased significantly. With the wind turbines reaching overall heights of 200 to 250 metres, this can increase the conflicts about proximity to residential areas. Therefore, Bavarian municipalities have to consider further regulations and concerns about project siting.
This study investigates the impact of the assessment of mayors on attitudes, perspectives and norms of the communities concerning wind energy projects. The objective of this study is to find out which factors played a role in the outcomes of the project, how important were the opinions of the local political figures and what other factors played a role in these case studies. It was also important to find out what role social norms are playing and the beliefs about the opinion of others. As an empirical-qualitative study, we compare the experiences from four cases in Bavaria, Germany and highlight the significant role of mayors. In these case studies, the processes and conflicts are analysed with techniques including document analysis and in-depth interviews.

0,"The role of media in influencing policy agenda has been subject of several studies, mostly in the US and Western Europe. The general finding is that it is difficult to capture the influence of the media agenda on policy decisions, but it has an effect on the symbolic policy agenda. However, very few research has addressed the problem in the context of the newer democracies of East and Central Europe. Previous studies on Hungary, focusing on the illiberal Orbán government, suggest that the media have no role in setting the policy agenda, and even the latter may drive the former. Our paper is the first attempt to draw a general picture of this disputed relationship in a non-Western context. Using media and interpellation data from the Hungarian Policy Agendas Project we investigate their relationship for the years 1990-2018, that is, the almost entirety of the democratic period since the regime change. The concept of Granger Causality is applied. While controlling for government cycle effects, public policy major topics are analysed separately in order to find existing uni- or multidirectional causal relationships. The hypothesis is that the hybridization of Hungarian politics that started in 2010 weakens the role of the media in influencing policy agendas since illiberal governance is less responsive to the thematisation of the media. We also study the phenomenon of parallelism and its role in the media – policy agendas nexus. Parallelism means that the media system is polarized and divided along political lines. We assume that parallelism has increased since 2010 which is reflected in the media agendas meaning that the thematic overlap between media agendas of outlets associated with different political sides has been decreasing. Previous studies on the Spanish media agenda demonstrated that there might be a systemic difference between politically aligned media outlets in terms of the policy topics they thematise more under different governments. We will study the phenomenon on the Hungarian data. We argue that the increasing parallelism of the media system affects not only the public sphere, but also the role of the media in influencing policy agendas. Growing parallelism probably contribute to the weakening of the media effect on policy agendas, which is not only relevant from a policy point of view, but as a sign of decreasing accountability raises concerns about the quality of democracy as well.",Centre for Social Sciences,Centre for Social Sciences,,,,,,,Centre for Social Sciences,,Tamás Barczikay,Zsolt Boda,,,,,,,Tamás Barczikay,,Communication,Influence,Policy-Making,,,,,,The media influence on policy agendas in Hungary: Studying the effect of regime hybridization,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=62584&EventID=185
0,"Issues with global relevance, such as migration, require specific approaches to address them adequately. However, as I shall argue, the current framework of the political theory of migration is mistaken in this respect for two reasons. The paper puts forward a two-pronged criticism of the mainstream political theory of migration. On the epistemological level of the argument, it criticizes the most notable works for their implicit bias towards methodological nationalism, by which they treat the nation-state inadequately and, consequently, give preference to immobility, sedentariness, or stasis at the expense of notions such as mobility, motion, and change. On the normative level, the paper challenges what I call the host standpoint of the mainstream literature, manifested both in what I label as the language of benevolent superiority, embodied in the language of human rights, and alarmism which serves as one of the main motives in debates about (im)migration. The argument in this regard is that the normative discussion about migration is addressed from a perspective analogous to the viewpoint of host or destination states, and this partial approach leaves out several essential elements of migration from consideration. As I shall argue, these are the main reasons for mainstream normative arguments focusing on the problems of immigration while forgetting to address migration as a broader and more complex phenomenon that requires thorough analysis and urgent solutions as well.",Centre for Social Sciences,,,,,,,,Centre for Social Sciences,,Anna Ujlaki,,,,,,,,Anna Ujlaki,,Migration,Political Theory,Global,Immigration,Methods,Ethics,Normative Theory,,The methodology of the political theory of migration,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64032&EventID=185
0,"International organizations (IOs) are increasingly contested among citizens and elites. While many scholars expect people’s political values to play a key role in shaping opinions toward IOs, recent research shows mixed support for this common assumption. In this paper, we provide a novel and comprehensive analysis of this issue, exploring to what extent, how and why political values matter for legitimacy beliefs toward IOs. The paper combines observational data from the most recent round of the World Values Survey and novel experimental data from a survey-embedded experiment fielded in 6 countries. Our argument is two-fold. First, political values are linked to legitimacy beliefs in ways that vary depending on country and IO context. The complexity of this relationship helps to explain the mixed findings in existing research. Second, political values nevertheless matter for people’s legitimacy beliefs in consistent ways, by shaping their perceived ideological proximity to IOs. When people perceive an IO to hold an ideological profile that is closer to their own political values, they conceive of it as more legitimate. These findings suggest that there is a common logic to the diverse ways in which political values are linked to legitimacy beliefs toward IOs.",University of Duisburg-Essen,Stockholm University,Stockholm University,,,,,,University of Duisburg-Essen,,Matthias Ecker-Ehrhardt,Lisa Dellmuth,Jonas Tallberg,,,,,,Matthias Ecker-Ehrhardt,,International Relations,Political Ideology,Survey Experiments,,,,,,The Missing Link: How Political Values Matter for Global Legitimacy Beliefs,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63563&EventID=185

0,"Elite studies that examine the determinants of ministerial careers have predominantly focused on two major theoretical approaches. The first approach highlights the effects of the institutional framework, particularly the role of political parties, prime ministers, presidents, and voters on ministerial careers. The second examines the individual-level perspective of contenders and ministers on the costs and benefits of holding a cabinet position, among the others, the influence of scandals, popularity, and individual resources on the individual’s desire to assume and hold a ministerial position. Although both approaches have their own merits, they also have shortcomings. The latter approach stresses individual perspectives and largely neglects the effects of the institutional setting in which politicians make their career decisions. The former approach stresses the importance of institutional setting. However, it places the significant determinants at the meso-level of the political system ignoring the macro-level factors such as constitutional rules.
This paper shows that such fundamental institutional settings as constitutions matter for ministerial careers. They frame the overall setting in which elections occur, parties select candidates, and ministers make their career decisions.

0,"Within conceptual analysis, many political theorists distinguish between moralized and non-moralized concepts. While the former represents always welcomed (or always unwelcomed) phenomena, the latter can be one way or the other depending on degrees and circumstances.  The paramount case is freedom: while some authors posit that freedom is a neutral description of lack of impediment, which can be either justified or unjustified, others maintain that freedom is solely a good thing to have, so they construe their definition in a way that is loaded with normative value. Likewise, scholars working on religion in political theory disagree over whether secularism is the neutral description of absence of religion in the public sphere, or otherwise a political value to be cherished, as it embodies the right way in which the state secures equal religious liberty in pluralist and multicultural societies. Drawing on these two cases and their seemingly common structure, this article distinguishes between the moralized and the non-moralized version of populism as a contested concept. As the moralized version goes, populism is plebian rule against an oligarchic minority. An opposed moralized version contends that populism is an inherently anti pluralist phenomenon, therefore prone to authoritarianism. In turn, the non-moralized version abandons the normative discourse to argue that populism, as a sense of rebellion against the elites, can be either a corrective or a threat to democracy, and therefore good or bad depending on the context and its features. The article finally interrogates about the contribution of the moralized / non-moralized distinction as a methodological tool in conceptual analysis and political theory more broadly.",Universidad Adolfo Ibáñez,,,,,,,,Universidad Adolfo Ibáñez,,Cristóbal Bellolio,,,,,,,,Cristóbal Bellolio,,Political Theory,Populism,Analytic,Methods,Normative Theory,,,,"The moralized / non-moralized distinction in conceptual analysis:  democracy, secularism and populism",https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64310&EventID=185
0,"This article maps the mechanism by which social media use may contribute to radical-right voting among individuals. Across Europe, there has been a rise in the electoral support for radical-right parties since the worst financial crisis of 2008 after the 1930s Great Depression and the worst refugee crisis of 2015 after World War II. Advances in digital communication have allowed radical-right parties to turn these crises into ideological debates centering on an exclusionary national identity, which promotes the binaries of “us vs them” and propagates xenophobia and even violence.

Several research disciplines have identified links between social media and this electoral success. The party politics literature shows social media design allows direct targeting of potential voters through decentralized platforms while fuelling misinformation and hate speech in an unregulated media environment. Political sociologists have focused on algorithms that amplify individual exposure and self-selection into filter bubbles and echo chambers, leading to polarisation and extreme segregation along group and partisan lines. However, this research still treats the new media environment as the traditional public sphere occupied by politicians and large media organisations who controlled national narratives, instead of recognising the technological shift that has transformed the voters from passive audiences to media creators themselves. This leaves the main mechanism connecting social media design to individual vote choices unexplained.

On the other hand, scholars of digital communication have found social media use is high among those who are unwillingness to engage in face-to-face interactions, find gratification in reinventing one’s personality in virtual platforms and have a greater urge to present a self-identity online. Radical-right propaganda always had a voice in conservative print and television mediums that were quite popular and allowed the creation of ideological echo chambers through self-selection and exposure. What was missing was the potential of individuals to voice their opinion, with the values they attach to the nation, openly, and develop networks with other like-minded citizens to find legitimisation for these ideas, or in short, expression and validation of who they consider themselves to be.

Therefore, bridging the political and sociological research with the digital communication literature, I advance the mechanism of self-presentation and self-expression of identities online to explain radical-right voting among those individuals who were earlier marginalised for such an identity and had no outlet to share and develop this identity. I argue that with long-term social media use, individuals learn to express this latent exclusionary nationalist identity and find legitimisation for it in like-minded networks, which then leads them to support parties that advance the same ideology. This also implies that social media has a greater mobilising effect on those with exclusionary national identity than for those who could freely express their national identity in the past. Relying on an original dataset of 12,000 individuals across six European nations, that measures social media use, vote choices, national identities, personality traits, political values, and socio-economic backgrounds, the study shows how and under what contexts social media use leads to vote for radical-right parties.",Universidad Carlos III de Madrid,,,,,,,,Universidad Carlos III de Madrid,,Kavyanjali Kaushik,,,,,,,,Kavyanjali Kaushik,,European Politics,National Identity,Nationalism,Political Psychology,Social Media,Communication,Electoral Behaviour,Voting Behaviour,"The More I Post, The More I Become: Expression of Exclusionary National Identity and Vote for Radical-right Parties in the Digital Age",https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64561&EventID=185
0,"This paper addresses the recent history of border asylum procedures in Europe and the sociolegal issues surrounding the implementation of norms in that context and their variation across time and space. Building on the author’s experience as both a French asylum judge (2010-2014) and a migration historian, it engages with a particular legal standard that gained traction as a
filtering tool in the late 1980s: the “manifestly unfounded” character of asylum claims. This notion and its equivalents, like the “credible fear” test in US law, are pivotal to the restrictive turn taken by the Global North in refugee status determination, and must be
understood within more general efforts to both fast-track and toughen screening procedures (Kerwin, 2015; Thielemann and Hobolth, 2016; FitzGerald, 2019). Examining how it has been translated into operable mechanisms across Europe reveals a constant tension between normative convergences on the one hand, and implementation divergences on the other, in both time and space. This paper argues that those discrepancies are due as much to institutional conditions as to the agency of the border asylum’s stakeholders, including would-be refugees themselves. As it offers a preliminary genealogical account of this evolution based on archival work and critical analysis, this paper not only contends that the observation of socio-legal practices calls for re-assessing the boundaries of migrant citizenship beneath and beyond the nation-state. It also claims that such ‘phylogenetic’ analysis of refugee legal realities at various scales can help norm producers better protect rights in the first place.",University of Oxford,,,,,,,,University of Oxford,,Fabrice Langrognet,,,,,,,,Fabrice Langrognet,,Migration,Asylum,Policy Implementation,Refugee,,,,,"The multiscalar variance of asylum at the border: the ‘manifestly unfounded’ filter in Europe as a centrifugal and interactional implementation story, 1985-2005",https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65283&EventID=185
0,"A large body of literature deals with the question under which circumstances political parties change their policy positions. These studies rely on the assumption that programmatic appeals are at the core of all parties’ strategies, and that they are one of the main reasons why voters support a given party. However, this assumption does not hold true for many parties in Europe, as some rely on clientelist strategies that trade benefits for political support. This raises the question to what extent our theories of party position change in established, programmatic settings can explain the positional shifts of parties in a more clientelist context. We argue that their applicability is limited, as the risks and benefits of party change vary with the degree of clientelism. Rather, we expect that the explanatory power of the known predictors of position shifts is weaker for parties that rely more on non-programmatic appeals. To test this, we compile a data set that combines expert survey estimates of key party characteristics with party manifesto data for the period 1999-2019.

0,"In February 2013 the European Union adopted the first comprehensive EU Cybersecurity Strategy. Since then, the cybersecurity threat landscape rapidly evolved. The salience of the so-called hybrid threats significantly increased. What is more, the COVID-19 pandemic and the confinement measures adopted by governments to stop the spread of the virus critically accelerated digitalization, resulting in a well-documented rise of cybercrime. In December 2020, the European Commission and the High Representative presented a new EU Cybersecurity Strategy for the Digital Decade, designed to bolster Europe’s collective resilience against cyber threats. Focusing specifically on the cybercrime dimension, this paper has two interrelated goals: to assess the success of the 2013 Cybersecurity Strategy and to verify if the changes introduced by the new Cybersecurity Strategy are a result of policy learning. Drawing on theoretical insights from the literature on policy evaluation (e.g. Bovens and ‘t Hart, 1996; 2016; Bovens, ‘t Hart and Kuipers, 2008; McConnell, 2010) and on policy learning (e.g. Hall, 1993; Bennett and Howlett, 1992; Howlett, 2012; Dunlop, Radaelli and Trein, 2018), our goal is to answer two main research questions: How successful was the 2013 Cybersecurity Strategy in tackling cybercrime?

0,"In the last decades, from diverse disciplines, academic currents, networks and also artists and intellectual fashions have intervened in the urgent need to rethink the meaning, scope and consequences of colonization. Unfortunately, the concern is leading to an overabundance of terminology, a cult of novelty, a propensity for essentialism, a lack of knowledge of Latin American academic literature and/or a ""deliberate rapacity"" in the ""appropriation of other people's ideas"", avoiding reference explicit to the authors and expanding them, many times, through self-referenced speeches (Pérez Gerardo, 2018: 501-502). In this framework, and giving due credit, we want to recover the notion of ""internal colonialism.""

Our main goal in this paper is to analyze the explanatory potential of the concept of ""internal colonialism"" for the understanding of domination relationships exercised through the ""Four wheels of capitalism: exploitation, dispossession, contempt and repression"" (Zapatista Army of National Liberation, EZLN). We will focus our attention on the works of two Mexican thinkers who, in continuous dialogue (Bringel and Leone: 2021), inspired, turned into an ""analytical concept"" (Torres Guillén, 2017: 1) and debated ""internal colonialism"", shaping this notion as a central reference in studies on colonialism, understood not only as the manifestation of an international conflict, but also intra-national. We are especially interested in observing the concept of ""internal colonialism"" taking in mind the grievances generated to indigenous communities by the colonial mandate (Tzul Tzul, 2018) and the necessary deconstruction of the ways of understanding damage and reparation, without falling in essentialist approaches.

Pablo González Casanova and Rodolfo Stavenhagen are the thinkers who will be studied. In order to approach the concept of ""internal colonialism"", we will work on  a genealogy of both Pablo González Casanova's thought starting with the founding text ""Plural society, internal colonialism and development"" (1963), passing through Democracy in Mexico (1965) where considers that he systematized the concept, until “Internal Colonialism (a redefinition) (2003); as well as Rodolfo Stavenhagen, from his writing ""Classes, colonialism and acculturation"" (1963), through his ""Seven wrong theses on Latin America"" (1965), and to his recent reflection, after five decades, entitled ""Seven theses... fifty years later” (2020).",Universidad de Granada,Universidad Carlos III de Madrid,,,,,,,"GRANADA, Universidad de",,Rafael Vazquez,Isabel Wences,,,,,,,Rafael Vázquez García,,Latin America,Critical Theory,Race,Narratives,Power,Capitalism,,,"The notion of ""internal colonialism"" (colonialism interno) in the thought of Pablo Gonzalez Casanova and Rodolfo Stavenhagen",https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64246&EventID=185
0,"Empirical findings on the origins of political trust among adolescents are limited and tend to understand political trust as unidimensional. Building on recent research capturing the importance of conceptualizing political trust as a two-dimensional construct, the present study aims to investigate origins of trust in order and representative institutions among adolescents, using three theoretical frameworks: social capital, procedural fairness, and the critical citizen theory. It draws on data from a representative sample of eight-grade students across 15 European countries that participated in the International Civic and Citizenship Education Study (ICCS) 2016. Multilevel analyses show that determinants of political trust are predominantly found at the individual level. Specifically, positive relationships with peers as well as feeling fairly treated by teachers are strong, positive predictors of both types of trust. On the other hand, students with higher levels of civic knowledge indicate higher levels of trust in order institutions though similar levels of trust in representative institutions than less sophisticated students. Furthermore, whereas social capital and fair treatment perceptions affect adolescents across Europe in a similar, positive way; the effect of civic knowledge, in line with critical citizenship theory, varies not only by type of trust but also by country characteristics. Negative associations with both types of trust are found in countries that score low on the corruption index (e.g., Bulgaria), though positive associations are found in countries that score high on this index (e.g., Norway).

Only six Portuguese foreign fighters have joined Islamic State, but these men were radicalised not in Portugal, but in England. Indeed, Portugal seems to have particular conditions that contribute to explain he absence of violent radicalisation.

To understand some of these conditions, the author will present an in-depth study, with data collected with qualitative and quantitative methods, developed both in Portugal and in England. Some of the answers to the research question are related to a contrast between these two countries when it comes to integrate vulnerable communities, particularly Muslims, and the absence or not of blatant discrimination towards minorities. These study also explores some of the active and intentional measures that the Portuguese Muslim community implements to promote prevention of radicalisation among its members in Portugal.

0,"The article aims to explain the relationship between the parapolice groups and the Sandinista National Liberation Front (FSLN by its acronyms in Spanish), the ruling party in Nicaragua. In this sense, the main research question is why the regime of Daniel Ortega uses intimidation strategies and political violence, even when this implies that his Government will be more isolated from the international community by getting more sanctions from the US and the EU. Therefore, the research goal is to comprehend why, despite the sanctions and growing international isolation from the Western democracies, Daniel Ortega insists on using political violence as a resource to repress opposition demonstrations. In this sense, the theoretical framework will be the theory about autocratization processes, and how these processes, take place under a legal disguise. Besides, I will use the game theory to explain why parapolice groups carry out political violence. In this regard, the approach of the paper will be mixed methods research. The qualitative methods I intend to use are discourse analysis and the legal analysis of laws, particularly reforms to the Nicaraguan National Police Law and the Criminal Code; those reforms criminalize organizing protests without the permission of the National Police. In this sense, non-authorized demonstrations are under the label of terrorism. Additionally, there will be an analysis of the use of the judicial system to prosecute and condemn political opposition figures. In this sense, I pretend to analyze the use of legal tools such as the ""cybercrimes"" law to criminalize even the criticisms against the Government in social media such as Facebook, Twitter, and Tik-Tok. The scientific hypothesis is that the use of mobs and parapolice groups to intimidate and exercise physical violence against political opposition to the Government of President Daniel Ortega has more benefits for the survival of his regime than economic costs from the sanctions the Nicaraguan regime can get from the EU and the US. In this regard, the quantitative methods will shed light to determine whether there is a positive or negative correlation between the use of political violence and the economic sanctions from the US and the EU imposed on some of the high-rank representatives from the regime of Daniel Ortega. Therefore, this paper will have a multidisciplinary approach by combining legal and political science analyses. The expected outcomes are to find a causal explanation for the use of political violence and its respective modes, subtle and more evident, direct and indirect.

0,"European funding programmes are usually seen as a platform for European and international research cooperation. This paper examines the role which the participation of third countries in EU research funding programmes play in the EU’s science diplomacy (SD). It is based on the analysis of official documents from national and EU organizations, conducting semi-structured expert interviews with representatives of universities, as well as officials from national and EU institutions, and social network analysis of university networks at European and global levels. The paper shows that the participation of Swiss and British universities in EU framework programmes play an important role in SD not only with regard to their national needs, but also European ones. 
According to the recent Communication of the European Commission on a European strategy for universities (2022): universities in Europe are seen as Europe’s soft power and the essential actors in SD, which should strengthen the EU’s reputation as a cooperation partner for education, research and innovation with countries all over the world. To implement such an ambitious strategy for external connectedness, the EU needs to be open to extra-EU partners, including such countries as Switzerland, which is a former Horizon 2020 Associated Country, and the UK, which is a former EU member, taken into account that these countries occupy leading positions according to their scientific achievements and the internationalisation of education and scientific research at the European and global level. At the same time, the UK and Switzerland also represent interesting cases of SD due to their particular relations with the EU, which despite the high performance of these countries in Horizon 2020 Framework Programme considers the question of their association with a new Framework Programme Horizon Europe in the connection of wider relations between these countries and the EU. Building on the analysis of the negotiation processes on the association status to Horizon Europe of both Switzerland and the UK, as well as campaigns launched by the European university networks asking the EU leadership to prioritize science over political interests, this paper argues that participation of Swiss and British universities in EU research funding programmes can be seen not only as an example of diplomacy for science, but also of science for diplomacy.",European University Institute,,,,,,,,European University Institute,,Tatyana Bajenova,,,,,,,,Tatyana Bajenova,,European Politics,European Union,Foreign Policy,International Relations,Knowledge,Brexit,,,The participation of third countries in EU Research Funding Programmes and the EU’s Science Diplomacy: the Cases of Switzerland and the United Kingdom,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65993&EventID=185

0,"Most previous studies on parental political socialization interpret the similarity of parents and children in political orientations as evidence of direct intergenerational transmission from parents to their children. However, recent studies show that intergenerational similarity does not always indicate successful transmission and propose that the process of intergenerational transmission involves two distinct steps: perception and adoption (Ojeda & Hatemi, 2015; Hatemi & Ojeda, 2021). The perception-adoption approach posits that children have to first perceive the political orientations of their parents (correctly or incorrectly) before deciding (consciously or unconsciously) whether to adopt those perceived orientations. So far, the perception-adoption approach has been developed and tested in the context of a two-party system. The current paper will apply the model to examine the intergenerational transmission of political orientations (party preferences and left-right identification) in a multiparty context with original survey data of Dutch adolescents (14-20 years old) and their parents (N = 751 adolescent-parent pairs). Thus far, multiparty contexts have been thought to produce stringent tests of political socialization processes due to the relatively high fragmentation of party landscapes and electoral volatility. These characteristics may increase ambiguity and inconsistency in parental cue giving and increase the perceptual inaccuracy of children in multiparty contexts. I will test the latter assumption by examining Dutch adolescents’ perceptual accuracy in estimating their parents’ political attitudes. Moreover, I will test moderators of the perception and adoption stages of transmission (frequency of political discussions, political engagement, political knowledge, parental value strength).",University of Amsterdam,,,,,,,,University of Amsterdam,,Linet Durmuşoğlu,,,,,,,,Linet Durmuşoğlu,,Political Psychology,Electoral Behaviour,Voting Behaviour,Youth,,,,,The Perception and Adoption of Parental Political Orientations in the Dutch Multiparty Context,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64856&EventID=185
0,"The pandemic brought about new dynamics in the extremist protest arena. Fueled by anger against measures taken to contain Covid-19, new movements formed via social media platforms which combined far-right ideologies with conspiracy theories about the crisis as a pretext to radically transform national societies. The speed and scale of disinformation and hate as well as the pressure from governments to contain incitement and malinformation about health-related issues prompted new policies by tech companies to combat the free floating of conspiracist narratives and extremist organizing. In consequence, since the outbreak of the pandemic, huge numbers of postings and accounts have been removed to save the platforms’ users from harm. While this behavior has been welcomed by governments and civil society alike, criticism mounted about the regulatory power of platforms undemocratically defining the boundaries of public discourse. Hence, success and failure of new (and old) protest actors depend in great part on the decision making of tech companies. This brings about questions on which basis platforms make their decisions in granting access to political debate and how these decisions are justified and communicated to the public. Approaching the latter question, this paper delves into the justification narratives of tech companies in dealing with far-right conspiracism. Studying platforms as central players in the combat of the recent rise of extremism, central logics of self-regulation and content moderation in times of crisis will be exposed and compared across platforms such as Facebook, Twitter and Telegram. Theoretically grounded in the sociology of justification (Boltanski/Thévenot), this paper empirically examines three cases of platform interventionism in the German country context: The QAnon conspiracy cult, the Querdenken movement and the alternative media outlet Compact, a leading publication that combines far-right and conspiracist worldviews. Comparing rationales and procedures, the paper aims to unfold the interrelated dynamics of the acting of extremist actors, the supposed social responsibility of tech companies and the mounting pressure of further regulation. By bringing literature on platform governance, social media and the prevention of extremism, this paper aims to provide a fresh perspective on the technological affordances of far-right conspiracist mobilization under the condition of crisis.",Universität Hamburg,,,,,,,,Universität Hamburg,,Maik Fielitz,,,,,,,,Maik Fielitz,,Cyber Politics,Extremism,Governance,Social Movements,Social Media,Comparative Perspective,,,The platforms’ governance of far-right conspiracism,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65759&EventID=185
0,"Ambitious environmental regulations involve compliance costs for firms in the respective jurisdiction, but they also incentivise greener technologies and business models, which may turn into competitive advantages, especially when other countries adopt similarly stringent regulations with a time lag. At the same time, product cycle theory shows that costs decrease as technologies become mature and economies of scale kick in. Early movers thus face additional compliance costs plus the high production costs associated with new technologies. These early investments may or may not pay off in the future. In any case, early movers will try to create entry barriers to protect their innovation rents, using patents, brand reputation or capturing distribution channels. Late adopters may avoid the costs and risks involved in experimenting with new solutions, they may start using the new technologies only when costs have come down, and they may use old polluting technologies as long as they are allowed to; but they may miss the moment when they can still get a foothold in the newly developing clean technology markets. 
Policymakers and firms thus face a strategic dilemma; they need to make ex-ante assessments about costs and benefits of applying stringent environmental regulations either early or late. These decisions need to be taken under uncertainty about key parameters (technology cycles, behaviour of regulators in other jurisdictions, speed of cost digression etc.).Moreover, they need to design public-private industry deals that differ substantially depending on whether an early or late adopter strategy is chosen. 
This paper revisits existing theories on early mover advantages from a new angle. First, it takes specific constellations into account that are specific to environmental innovations, as these depend on politically negotiated regulatory framework, thereby adding a n additional layer of political uncertainty to the uncertainties of market-based innovation processes. Second, it considers the public-private negotiation of innovation strategies to either reap early mover or late mover advantages.
This analytical framework is then applied to the case of electric buses. The e-bus market is politically created using mandatory emission standards, purchase subsidies and public procurement. This way, China developed the electric bus market since 2009, ten years ahead of the European Clean Vehicles Directive and related national and city-level policies.

0,"The state’s central role in facilitating renewable energy transitions underlines the importance of exploring contextual political-economic factors and their influence on the directionality and pace of decarbonisation in South Africa. Scholars have found that competing political agendas, economic interests and energy outlooks have hamstrung efforts to diversify the country’s power sector, which remains in crisis, reliant on coal-generated electricity and rooted in an economy based on mining and minerals beneficiation. As research attention shifts away from power towards end-use applications and hard-to-decarbonise sectors, how these contextual factors are shaping the trajectory of newer renewable energies in South Africa has yet to be elucidated. This paper investigates the case of South Africa’s developing green hydrogen economy, a national priority that seeks to leverage the country’s considerable platinum group metals reserves (as a premium catalyst in hydrogen fuel cells). Initiated in 2007 with Cabinet approval of the flagship Hydrogen South Africa Programme (HySA), the government has since galvanised powerful private- and public-sector actors – many of whom are embedded in existing energy and mining (and other) regimes – to develop related knowledge, competencies and products. A mixed-method single case study will be used to develop contextualised explanations of how political and economic interests are shaping state interventions and policies with a particular focus on equitable wealth distribution (a key objective of the Programme) and related patterns in financial resources mobilisation. Over the next three months, we will collect data from semi-structured interviews with key actors, supplemented by secondary data sources, including policy documents, government records and grey literature (2007 – 2021). Adopting the theoretical lens of the multi-level perspective (MLP) on socio-technical transitions, data will be analysed to identify core actor networks, causal influences and structures that constitute green hydrogen niche interactions within South Africa’s energy regime. The MLP is a prominent, systems-based approach to sustainability transitions studies offering a typology of transition pathways based on actors and types of multi-level interactions. The South African government has set an ambitious target of commanding 25% of the global hydrogen and fuel cell market, intended to provide a bedrock for national energy security, wealth creation and inclusive development. In this context, we argue that it is critical to understand how the political economy is defining the future of green hydrogen in South Africa’s energy system and, in particular, the mechanisms through which the stated objectives of equity and inclusiveness will be achieved.",University of Johannesburg,,,,,,,,University of Johannesburg,,Amanda-Leigh O'Connell,,,,,,,,Amanda-Leigh O'Connell,,Africa,Political Economy,Social Welfare,Energy Policy,,,,,THE POLITICAL ECONOMY OF ENERGY TRANSITIONS: THE CASE OF GREEN HYDROGEN IN SOUTH AFRICA,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64705&EventID=185
0,"While the extant literature has helped us better understand the growing popularity of radical right populist parties and candidates in many advanced market capitalist countries in recent decades, significant gaps remain. To this end, this paper will examine the sources of individual and subnational variation in electoral support for the radical right by developing a series of multilevel models exploring the connection between votes for the radical right and a range of individual-level and contextual variables that are hypothesized to promote support for these parties and candidates. Variables of particular interest include income inequality, poverty, fiscal redistribution/poverty reduction, unemployment rates, immigration flows, government performance, levels of corruption, and trust in public servants. Individual-level data come from Wave 5 of the Comparative Study of Electoral Systems and contextual variables are from various sources, including both national and subnational measures of income inequality and poverty from the LIS Datacenter as well as data on trust and government performance from the 2016 International Social Survey Program’s (ISSP) Module on the “Role of Government V.” We examine a total of 20 elections for the following countries and election years: Australia (2019), Austria (2017), Belgium (2019), Brazil (2018), Canada (2019), Chile (2017), Finland (2019), France (2017), Germany (2017), Great Britain (2017), Greece (2015), Hungary (2018), Iceland (2016), Ireland (2016), Italy (2018), Lithuania (2016), Norway (2017), Sweden (2018), Switzerland (2019), and the United States (2016).

0,"Over the past two centuries human rights international nongovernmental organizations (INGOs) have not only proliferated around the globe, but also contributed to promoting and protecting human rights at the international and domestic levels. Although the literature has demonstrated the significant role of human rights INGOs for social change and global governance, little systematic attention has been paid to why patterns of human rights INGOs’ organizational founding and population growth have developed in the modern world system the way they did. This paper seeks to fill this important void in International Relations by examining the determinants of human rights INGO founding during the post-Congress of Vienna period from 1817 to 2009 through a mixed-methods research design. Drawing from insights from field theories in sociology and political science, it advances the politico-institutionalist argument that the hegemonic United States, other sovereign states, and their intergovernmental arrangements have created incentives for human rights INGO founding. The argument receives strong support from Bayesian data analysis while accounting for alternative explanations that emphasize the organizational form’s legitimacy, resource competition, globalization, and other factors, as well as from process-tracing studies of select human rights INGOs in history.",Australian National University,,,,,,,,Australian National University,,Dongwook Kim,,,,,,,,Dongwook Kim,,Contentious Politics,Globalisation,Human Rights,International Relations,Political Methodology,Constructivism,NGOs,,The Political Foundations of the Ecology of Human Rights International NGOs,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64635&EventID=185
0,"Spectacular events such as Brexit and the US Capitol riots have been widely recognised as signalling a crisis in Western representative democracies. From questions of political leaders’ mental health to the seemingly distorted perception of reality amongst increasingly cloistered sections of populations, this political crisis has displayed an important psychological dimension. While operating within the field of political theory, the paper critically interrogates the specificity of the psychological aspects associated with practices of democratic representation. 
In the face of resurgent critiques of representative government, an important strand in democratic theory has recently reaffirmed the irreplaceable value of representation to contemporary democracy.  Rather than a somewhat defective substitute for the ideal of direct democracy, scholars of the so-called “representative turn” rediscovered representative democracy as itself an ideal model – one, specifically, that fosters in citizens a “representational” mode of judging reality which accounts for a plurality of viewpoints. Crucially, democratic representation here is not understood as pertaining exclusively to the sphere of formal/electoral politics, but as a feature permeating the fabric of democratic societies at myriad levels, including instances as diverse as non-elected political actors, representatives of the scientific community, and trade union representatives. 
Building on this, my work intervenes to explore whether and how the psychological impact of such practices of representation succeeds in fostering a representational use of judgment. Whilst scholars across relevant academic fields have focused almost exclusively on representation from the perspective of represented citizens, my research adopts the neglected epistemological perspective of representative themselves: citizens engaged in the experience of representing of others. Looking from what I term the “representative standpoint”, I bring to light underexplored features of the mechanics and dynamics governing both institutional and non-institutional instances of representation, drawing links between their purely formal aspects and the psychological experiences that they involve. In particular, I analyse the political psychology of representing others looking at the four fundamental relationships that that I take it to entail: 1. the relationship between the representative and the group (party, social movement, etc.) to which they belonged prior to their identification as representative; 2. the relationship between the representative and the general public; 3. the relationship between a representative and the representatives of other groups; 4. the relationship of the representative with themselves. In conclusion, I gesture towards the potential impact of my analysis in matters of institutional design and practices of social innovation.",University of Warwick,,,,,,,,University of Warwick,,Clementina Gentile Fusillo,,,,,,,,Clementina Gentile Fusillo,,Democracy,Political Leadership,Political Psychology,Political Theory,Representation,,,,The political psychology of representing others,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65350&EventID=185
0,"Foreign policy has traditionally been a policy apart: executive-driven, with little public deliberation and with implementation focused on political communication, diplomatic interaction and few economic instruments. This peculiarity of foreign policy has also been institutionalised at European level, where the Common Foreign and Security Policy is firmly grounded in transnational cooperation and outside of the EU legislative framework. Despite this insistence of EU member states on keeping foreign policy procedurally and institutionally apart from external relations, though, the incoherence between the mighty European tools of external relations (trade, external assistance, sanctions) and the weakly-enforced political ambitions is a reoccurring theme among EU practitioners and scholars throughout the past 30 years.
This “nexus” between foreign policy and external relation policies is the starting point of this paper, which examines the politics of politicisation of the EU´s international relations. It assesses the mechanisms and implications of two parallel, interdependent but still distinct European processes currently at play: the politicisation of European external relations on the one, and the politicisation of EU foreign policy cooperation on the other hand. The paper contends that these politicisation processes need to be analysed separately, because different mechanisms are at play. However, these politicisation processes also need to be analysed in unison, as their interplay indicates less of a paradigm shift in positioning the EU as an international actor than the analysis of these two processes separately might suggest.",University for Continuous Education Krems (Danube University Krems),,,,,,,,University for Continuous Education Krems (Danube University Krems),,Heidi Maurer,,,,,,,,Heidi Maurer,,European Politics,European Union,Foreign Policy,,,,,,"The politicisation of the EU´s international relations: a paradigm shift in tone, not in substance?",https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65354&EventID=185

It finds that DI is a low salience issue, expect in the context of certain key events (i.e. EU treaty change). Moreover, the positions of Irish governments are highly policy- and context dependent.

0,"The international science-policy interface on climate change is often presented as a success story. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which produces regular assessments of the knowledge on climate change, its impacts and solutions, is seen as a key knowledge provider to the UN Framework-Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The IPCC in particular provides guidance on the definition of the Convention’s Long-Term Global Goal (LTGG), agreed by all the Parties at COP16 in Cancun in 2010. The IPCC, however, despite its close connection to the UNFCCC, formally remains an independent institution and lacks any ‘official channel’ to provide inputs into the negotiations. IPCC reports are discussed on an ad hoc basis by the UNFCCC’s Subsidiary Body of Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA) and conflicts often arose about the role that they should have in the UNFCCC decision-making processes – in 2018, several countries opposed ‘welcoming’ the IPCC Special Report of Global Warming of 1.5° C (SR15), instead arguing that SBSTA should only ‘take note’ of it. 
To strengthen its science-policy interface, the UNFCCC established a Structured Expert Dialogue (SED) to ensure the ‘scientific integrity’ of the UNFCCC periodic review – a mechanism seeking to periodically review the adequacy of the LTGG. While a UNFCCC mechanism, the SED faces similar challenges than the IPCC in communicating the latest scientific information to UNFCCC diplomats. 

This paper reviews both the formal and informal processes through which scientific information is presented in the UNFCCC. First, it provides a historical perspective on more than 30 years of collaboration and competition between the IPCC and the UNFCCC. Second, it analyzes the opportunities and challenges that the establishment of the SED represents for a renewed science-policy dialogue. In particular, we compare the two SEDs which ran respectively from 2013 to 2015 and from 2020 to 2022 under the 1st and 2nd periodic review processes of the LTGG of the UNFCCC and will open on the ongoing discussion on the new Technical Dialogue set for the Global Stocktake of the Paris Agreement. The objective of the paper is to theorize on the multiple and messy ways in which science-policy interfaces are intertwined and institutionalized in global governance, and their limits. It is based on UNFCCC and IPCC online archives, online session analyses, participant observations in both institutions and Conferences of the Parties (COPs), as well as semi-structured interviews.",Sciences Po Paris,Université de Lausanne,University of Geneva,,,,,,Sciences Po Paris,,Kari De Pryck,Adèle GAVEAU,Geraldine Pflieger,,,,,,Kari De Pryck,,Environmental Policy,Globalisation,Governance,Knowledge,Climate Change,Policy Change,,,The Politics of Institutionalizing International Science-Policy Interfaces.

Extant literature on TJ undervalues the role of religious actors in post-conflict societies. International actors tend to embrace state-centric approaches associated with criminal tribunals and truth commissions and put less empirical focus on religious agents as distinct players in TJ contexts. Unlike South Africa where the religious actors wholeheartedly embraced the TJ process, the Kenyan mainstream religious groups under the National Council of Churches (NCCK) and Supreme Council of Kenya Muslims (SUPKEM) supported the International Criminal Court (ICC) process but remained pessimistic of the Kenyan Truth, Justice and Reconciliation Commission (TJRC-K) in providing justice to the victims and perpetrators of violence.

0,"Complex global governance systems often emerge as the result of political-strategic disputes between multiple interest groups. Private governance, for example, is not a merely technical and problem-solving phenomenon independent of politics but rather the outcome of power struggles between a wide range of state and non-state actors. The private governance literature and its interactions with the global value chain/production network (GVC/GPN) approaches have focused extensively on lead firms. And, more recently, growing academic attention has been devoted to public-private interactions, thus bringing the state back into the analysis. Industry associations, however, are key actors that are still overlooked and undertheorized. Industry associations are relevant players in public-private and local-global interactions and can have a significant influence on the design and implementation of value chain sustainability governance. Based on this, I develop a theoretical framework that puts industry associations at the center of the analysis and focuses on why and how they shape the private sustainability governance of value chains. My argument is that industry associations’ agency needs to be understood in relation to their position at the intersection of bottom-up and top-down commercial and governance-related pressures as both regulatory intermediaries (of which there is expanding literature) and as actors who must respond to changing factors at the producer and buyer levels. I apply my theoretical framework in exploratory cross-case comparisons between Brazilian soy and sugarcane industries and resort to process tracing to explain the agency of national industry associations. By recognizing that conflicting interests and demands around non-deforestation rules drive and shape how selected Brazilian industry associations influence private sustainability arrangements, this qualitative research contributes to a better understanding of value chain governance in emerging economies. This is especially important in a polycentric trade era. And the focus on the collective action of national interest groups can help both public and private sustainability programs update their strategic decisions to improve on-the-ground impacts. Although my theoretical and empirical investigations focus on private governance, I also discuss how my findings might apply to an increasing number of mandatory state-led supply chain regulations that are recently emerging and being incorporated into our complex and still in the making system of legal and regulatory pluralism.","Willy Brandt School of Public Policy, Universität Erfurt",,,,,,,,"Willy Brandt School of Public Policy, Universität Erfurt",,Karina Marzano Franco,,,,,,,,Karina Marzano Franco,,Environmental Policy,Globalisation,Governance,Interest Groups,Latin America,Business,Power,Influence,The Politics of Sustainable Supply Chains: Brazilian Industry Associations as Agents in Private Governance,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65679&EventID=185
0,"Transitioning from fossil fuels and nuclear energy to an age of renewable energy is a challenge for many industrialized countries. Despite being considered the most effective and economically efficient instrument to generate continuous and long-term incentives for environmentally-friendly innovation and practices, carbon taxes are particularly difficult to implement politically. Scholars have demonstrated that the cost perceptions that characterize carbon taxes and a low level of knowledge about how these instruments work are fundamental reasons for their unpopularity. Against this background, recent research has investigated whether better informed citizens and more visible policy benefits could increase policy support but suggests that the link between information, perceived benefits and policy support is complex. This is the starting point of our contribution, in which we delve deeper into the question whether and under which conditions more information leads to stronger policy support. We thereby consider different types of information, namely information about how the policy works as well as about its individual and collective benefits. Moreover, based on recent research, we expect that the visibility and relevance of these policies’ costs and benefits strongly depend on the politization of the issue. We therefore further theorize and test, how information effects vary contingent on party-political constellations. We test our claims using original survey data from Switzerland, including a conjoint experiment combined with a split ballot design with information treatment. These results produce relevant policy implications regarding the design of carbon taxes and the role of knowledge and beliefs for environmental attitudes and behavior.",Universität Bern,,,,,,,,Universität Bern,,Isabelle Stadelmann-Steffen,,,,,,,,Isabelle Stadelmann-Steffen,,Environmental Policy,Green Politics,Climate Change,Experimental Design,Political Ideology,Public Opinion,Energy Policy,,The politization of green taxes: How information and party cues affect popular support,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63130&EventID=185
0,"This paper examines opposition to populist parties in Europe and develops a theory to evaluate the effectiveness of that opposition. It breaks new ground by developing a model of democratic defence as 'normal politics' able to account for opposition to populist parties as a routine activity using ordinary tools of law, politics and protest. In this way, the paper seeks to move debate about responses to populist parties beyond the tradition of militant democracy, which focuses on exceptional, rights-restricting forms of opposition such as party bans. Democratic defence as 'normal politics' involves a wider range of initiatives by civil society actors, political parties, states and international organisations across multiple, overlapping territorial spheres of governance. Forms of opposition range from international sanctions, litigation in state and supranational courts, mobilising institutional checks and balances constraining executive power, ostracism, stealing populist party policies, collaboration with populists, international monitoring, street protests and boycotts, and the demonisation and condemnation of populist parties in the public sphere. Conceiving democratic defence as 'normal politics' requires new tools for evaluating effective opposition to populist parties. Rather than the often normatively problematic and unrealistic goal of defeating populist parties wholesale, the book shows it is better to think of effectiveness as achieving less-ambitious, but still consequential goals – curbing illiberal and anti-democratic policies, reducing support for populist parties, diminishing their resources, and inducing moderation. These outcomes, and how they come about, are discussed in the paper, illustrated in cases including the Italian Five Star Movement, The League and Forza Italia, Alternative for Germany, the French National Rally (formerly National Front), Freedom Party of Austria, Podemos and Vox in Spain, Danish People’s Party, Finn’s Party, the Dutch Party for Freedom, SYRIZA in Greece, the Czech Action of Dissatisfied Citizens, the Polish Law and Justice Party, the Citizens for the European Development of Bulgaria, Movement for a Better Hungary and Hungarian Civic Alliance (Fidesz).",University of Roskilde,,,,,,,,University of Roskilde,,Angela Bourne,,,,,,,,Angela Bourne,,Comparative Politics,Democracy,Populism,,,,,,The Populist People vs The Other People: Effective Opposition to Populist Parties,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64451&EventID=185
0,"The presidential candidacy of Jair Bolsonaro in Brazil in 2018 was the Populist Radical Right's (PRR) first one to be electorally successful in Latin America. His election disrupted the prevailing pattern of political and electoral competition and was responsible for: i) breaking with the foundations of the party system that had been in operation for more than two decades in the country; ii) the ""change of the guard"" on the political right, where the ""conventional right"" was replaced by the ""far-right"", particularly the PRR. The rise of this new political right in Brazil is complex and multifaceted. Although it is possible to assert that Bolsonaro belongs to the PRR, there are still few studies that analyze how Bolsonaro articulates the three defining attributes of the PRR: nativism, populism, and authoritarianism, as well as their interaction in the Brazilian context.

This paper aims to analyze how those attributes compose Jair Bolsonaro's discourse both in the 2018 elections and throughout his presidential term, which ends in 2022. Therefore, and according to the research questions proposed by the panel, three topics will be addressed: a) how Bolsonaro articulated authoritarianism and nativism with populism, as recent studies show that populist attitudes played a reduced role in the 2018 presidential elections (Castanho Silva, Fuks and Tamaki 2022); b) how populism and the definition of members of ""the pure people"" and ""the corrupt elite"" can be associated with the mobilization of negative political identities, particularly anti-establishment and antipetismo ones (Fuks 2021); c) what is the role that new political positions play in PRR, particularly moral conservatism and law and public order and whether these would be inserted within defining attributes or would actually be new attributes to be added to the Brazilian context and amplified in Latin America. Finally, the articulation between authoritarianism and nativism in Brazil will be analyzed by associating nativism with ethnic-racial groups and authoritarianism with the past of the military dictatorship.",Universidad Diego Portales,,,,,,,,Universidad Diego Portales,,Talita Tanscheit,,,,,,,,Talita Tanscheit,,Latin America,Populism,Political Ideology,,,,,,The Populist Radical Right in Brazil: Jair Bolsonaro,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63713&EventID=185
0,"In contrast to most Latin American countries, post-transition Chile has right-wing political parties that have not only managed to establish themselves and endure, but also to develop successful electoral cooperation strategies at the municipal, parliamentary and presidential levels. However, internal conflicts within the right-wing bloc have intensified in the last few years, and nowadays a new right-wing party has emerged: the Partido Republicano, headed by José Antonio Kast. The latter openly criticizes the moderation of the right and seeks to give voice to those who feel betrayed by established right-wing parties. As he pointed out in his electoral program for the 2017 presidential election, “the biggest mistake of the right in recent years has been to renounce its own principles and adjust its values to win the sympathy of certain sectors”. It is worth indicating that almost no studies systematically analyze the Partido Republicano and José Antonio Kast. The latter competed in the 2021 presidential election and put together an electoral list for the 2021 congressional election. This paper seeks to examine this case study using the conceptual framework of populist radical right developed by Mudde (2007), who argues that the latter has three defining attributes: authoritarianism, nativism, and populism. Particular emphasis will be placed on the information produced by the Partido Republicano and José Antonio Kast himself, such as propaganda, official discourses, webpages, and Facebook and Twitter accounts. Our idea is to undertake qualitative content analysis to distinguish how authoritarian, nativist, and populist ideas are articulated. This type of analysis will permit us not only to figure out how the members of both “the pure people” and “the corrupt elite” are constructed, but will also put the Chilean populist radical right in comparative perspective, since this type of framework has been already applied to understand the populist radical right in Europe and beyond.",Universidad Diego Portales,Universidad Diego Portales,,,,,,,Universidad Diego Portales,,Cristóbal Rovira Kaltwasser,Lisa Zanotti,,,,,,,Lisa Zanotti,,Latin America,Populism,Political Ideology,,,,,,The populist radical right in contemporary Chile: the case of José Antonio Kast and the Partido Republicano,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63717&EventID=185
0,"Since 2015, pro-government media in Poland has been proposing the new understanding of political representation in the light of the government “politics of care”. The idea of linking concepts of “political representation” with “care” breaks with the assumptions of Hanna Pitkin (1967), who did not recognize care as an authentic form of political representation. Clearly, for the ruling Law and Justice “care” means something very different from Pitkin’s description or the individual principle of ethical development as clarified by Carol Gilligan (1982). Rather, it is a central point in a hegemonic strategy that ties into a single discursive structure supporters of increased welfare, extensive state projects, and the revival of national pride (Laclau & Mouffe, 1985). On the level of party politics, what the government describes as the historic empowerment of the people, its liberal critics see as downgrading of political representation to a form of ideological cover for the network of political patronage (Markowski, 2016). The debate announces an epistemic cut, the rejection of a specific project of political representation that arose as a dialectical reaction to the ""ontology of socialism"" (Staniszkis, 1989). The introduced ""procedures of care"" had the power to both reconstruct the political scene - a new division into solidary and liberal Poland - and change the rules of political subjectivization. The scope of this power, however, has changed with the onset of the pandemic.

In my paper, I will try to analyse the interference of COVID-19 in the process of reconstructing the assumptions of what is political representation in Poland. I will undertake this task in the spirit of the structural turn in representation theory, but I will not use the influential theoretical framework of Michel Saward as I share some ""normative concerns"" regarding the applicability of his work in some cases (Saward, 2010; Severs 2020). Instead, I want to use deconstruction as a method of discourse analysis, proposing a new form of ""clôtural reading"" of the discourse of care in Poland (Critchley, 1992; Thomassen, 2010). I will try to analyse the ethical consequences of the government's attempt to extend the existing politics of care to health politics. I will try to show that analysis of the worrisome rise in support for the far-right groups, which openly undermines the very reality of the pandemic, cannot be separated from the problem of representing historically disadvantaged groups, which has been instrumentalized but not resolved. I believe the pandemic has exposed the necessity to reread political representation as a form of meeting the Other in need. However, in order to avoid the problem of rewriting the theory of representation in the language of patriarchy (through the ontology of logocentrism), my work will be based on my field research of ""clients"" of the Municipal Social Assistance Center in Wrocław (Poland). I hope that in this way I will be able to hear their voice and underline the need to take into account the ethical perspective not only in the process of implementing political representation, but also in its research.",University of Wrocław,,,,,,,,University of Wrocław,,Mateusz Zieliński,,,,,,,,Mateusz Zieliński,,Political Theory,Populism,Representation,Constructivism,Post-Modernism,Ethics,Normative Theory,Political Ideology,The procedures of care – COVID-19 intervention in the process of reconstructing the meaning of political representation in Poland,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=66029&EventID=185
0,"Marine community science has gained momentum as a participatory approach to knowledge production that uses amateurs to contribute to the evidence-base that underpins marine policy. By increasing monitoring efforts and empowering members of the public to take political action to protect the oceans, community science has helped to transform marine management to address issues, such as, sea-level rise, overfishing, and ocean acidification. The growing success of marine community science has led to a greater interest and involvement of government bodies in projects, with the initiatives of many Non-Government Organisations (NGOs) now funded by government. Although government support for community science projects may appear as a transfer of power to NGOs and their volunteers, it may also act to limit the radical potential of community knowledge production. Attempts to professionalise marine community science reduces the capacity of projects to empower local knowledge and to transform marine management processes. Drawing on a survey of community volunteers and NGO interviews, we illustrate how the professionalisation of community science limits participation and tends to exclude activists seeking to challenge the neoliberal marine governance.",Queen's University Belfast,,,,,,,,Queen's University Belfast,,Wesley Flannery,,,,,,,,Wesley Flannery,,Civil Society,Environmental Policy,Climate Change,,,,,,The professionalisation of marine community science as a limitation to researcher-activist participation,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63491&EventID=185
0,"Between 2013 and 2017, Germany experienced a considerable increase in populist radical right voting. However, this increase was not uniform across German regions. While the gap in the party’s election result becomes most visible between the former FDG and West Germany, there are differences within the Eastern and the Western part of the country, too. Apart from that, the common explanation of the rural-urban divide in populist radical right voting does not fully apply to the German case as there are rural places in Northern Germany that have very low rates of AfD voters whereas the party was able to succeed in the metropolitan Ruhr area. The left-behind approach is neither fruitful: The most prominent stronghold of the AfD – Erzgebirge/Saxony – is the economically best performing federal state in the East. Germany therefore represents an interesting case for the question of spatial patterns of populist radical right voting behaviour. While scholars already know very much about macro- and micro-level factors for populist radical right voting, the mechanisms linking both together are largely unknown. The paper therefore aims to explain the link between local context and individual vote choice for the AfD and thereby understand the spatial variation of AfD results.

To explain the puzzle, the paper proposes a two-step theoretical argumentation: First, it argues for a modified understanding of local contextual effects. Not only the present and immediate surrounding of an individual is relevant but also how the local context performs in comparison with other contexts and how it did perform in the past. Therefore, spatial disparities and local change have to be taken into account when thinking about contextual effects. Second, the assumption of a general effect of local contexts on individual vote choices needs to be reconsidered: Individuals are different, contexts are different, thus, contexts may have different impacts on different individuals and voters may react differently on their environments. Hence, the local context acts through different mechanisms, which may vary between regions and individuals. In order to explain the spatial variation of the AfD's election results, therefore, a differentiated approach is needed: On the one hand, local contextual determinants need to be considered in relation to situations in other places and in relation to the past; on the other hand, a differentiated understanding of the mechanisms is necessary, since contextual situations can have different effects on different individuals in different places.

The paper combines individual-level data and contextual-level data on neighbourhood-, county- and regional level to account for the uncertainty about the (ir-)relevance of different geographical levels. Multi-level regression models with cross-level interactions and structural equation models are conducted to answer the research question.

0,"There is a growing body of literature focusing on youth parties as these organisations have crucial roles linking young people to established political parties (Bruter & Harrison 2009; de Roon 2020; Hooghe and Stolle 2005). Important functions of youth parties include recruiting, training and socializing new members and future political leaders (Rainsford 2018). Youth parties are said to be more radical than their mother parties (Weber 2017). They articulate their party ideology clearer and present more radical policy proposals. However, youth party elites can have aspirations of a future political career and therefor may want to adjust their attitudes to be able to climb the ladder in politics. There might therefore be similarities on policy issues between youth party elites and parent party elites.
	There is a well-established literature on issue congruence between politicians and those they represent, such as voters and party elites (Valen & Narud 2007) and citizens and European Parliament candidates (Dalton 2017). Several studies also focus on different party strata (Allern, Heidar and Karlsen 2015; Kölln and Polk 2017, Van Holsteyn, Ridder and Koole 2015). However, few studies have in fact directly compared the political attitudes and opinions of youth politicians with those of their parent party or the electorate. In this article we therefore ask: Are youth party elites more radical than are party elites and voters? To answer this question, we study issue-congruence between the three levels of political parties drawing on three surveys to different types of actors in Norway: youth elite politicians (The Norwegian Youth Party) , parliamentary candidates (the Norwegian Candidate Survey), and voters (the Norwegian Election Study). To test issue-congruence, we zoom in on essential issue dimensions in contemporary politics: the general ideological left-right-scale as well as the contested issue dimensions climate, immigration and centre-periphery.",Universitetet i Oslo,Universitetet i Oslo,,,,,,,Universitetet i Oslo,,Kristoffer Kolltveit,Rune Karlsen,,,,,,,Kristoffer Kolltveit,,Political Parties,Party Members,Youth,,,,,,"The radical youth?

0,"The European Commission in the Action Plan on Financing Sustainable Growth assigns a substantial role to Sustainable Finance in the path towards sustainability. Since 2018 in Europe a process of regulating Sustainable Finance has started and in accordance with the rationale applied for European governance, it includes many stakeholders. Among different interventions, substantial developments have been made especially thanks to the publication of the EU Taxonomy Regulation 2020/8526 and its subsequent Delegated Acts 2021/21397 and 2021/21788, but also whit the Social Taxonomy. The process involved several actors, from the Commission's official advisory groups to Parliament. The process is interesting for 3 main reasons: 1. the representations underlying the regulatory decisions of sustainable finance; 2. the relationship between the latter and the actors included in the process; 3. the interests linked to the representations and mechanisms that these representations trigger. Concerning the first point, central is the role played by the experts who are directing the action of the European Commission. But what cognitive and normative representations make up the “world view” such players convey? This paper aims at bringing out some cognitive and normative representations made by the experts included in the Platform on Sustainable Finance in their role as mediators. Specifically, this paper – starting from the assumption that the experts included in the PSF not only play a manifest role of bringing a technical truth, but they also play a latent role of mediator of a certain “world view”- uses the analytical approach of the référentiel and some artefacts created by the PSF. This paper begins by defining the concept of Sustainable Finance and describing the fundamental European regulatory steps in this sector. The second part of the paper, by introducing the study case of the Platform on Sustainable Finance, analyses the relevant stakeholders through the literature regarding the role of knowledge into the decision-making processes. While the third section aims at presenting the methodology and the analytical approach used. Last section reports the main achieved empirical evidence applied to a PSF subgroup. This last part results from a preliminary analysis aimed at assessing the validity of the methodological approach and from one of the analysis’ tools likely to be used to complete that.",Sapienza University of Rome,,,,,,,,Sapienza University of Rome,,Tiziana Nupieri,,,,,,,,Tiziana Nupieri,,Environmental Policy,Representation,Knowledge,Political Sociology,Qualitative,Policy-Making,,,"The regulation of Sustainable Finance: UE Taxonomy between interests and ideas.

0,"It can be stated that the U.S. (besides the EU) is the main antitrust international benchmark. On the other hand, its OECD general PMR indicator (that measures the degree to which regulatory policies promote or restrict competition) is not so good (WSJ, 2021; GUIMARAES, 2021: 19) : 1,71, significantly higher (worse) than the average indicator of the OECD member countries (1,43) – the best indicator is the one of the UK (0,78), while the less procompetitive is the one of China (2,99).

As the Biden administration knows, the majority of the issues addressed by the Executive Order on Promoting Competition (EO) are not only American , but mainly global. In my recent paper cited above, I made a preliminary effort to demonstrate that anticompetitive laws and regulations (harming consumer welfare or other possible controversial  policy goals – PPR, 2021) are indeed a global challenge, which is evidenced by the fact that diverse countries have some mechanism for making competition and regulatory authorities interacting (“findings”), and thus expectedly producing regulation that is more procompetitive. Key references are OECD Best Practice Roundtables on Competition Policy and jurisdictions such as (OECD, 2019; OECD, 2021a)  Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Colombia, Czech Republic, European Union, Israel, Italy, Korea, Mexico, Norway, Peru, Russia, Spain, Taiwan, UK, Ukraine, and USA (see also OECD 2021b) .    

It should be highlighted that these are remarkably interdisciplinary issues, in need of a proficient dialogue between academic disciplines in the field of social sciences and management. This is evidenced by the fact that competition policy is generally divided between two or three branches (merger review and anticompetitive practices, the latter subdivided between cartels and unilateral conducts), and little attention is given to the so called competition advocacy (GUIMARAES, 2015: 408)  – that goes well beyond legal proceedings and economic analyses present in the traditional branches of antitrust policy – in which the authority has to interact with legislators, regulators, private sector, and nonprofits, thus exercising its political and public management functions (BARZELAY, 2019: 157)  in full, even when this is done strictly in accordance with the mandate of an independent agency.

In this sense, there are some sections of the EO that are particularly important in terms of regulatory (and competition) governance. Describing the sections more broadly, and already focusing on its importance in comparative terms: (5.u) addresses the relationship between regulatory oversight bodies (ROBs) and competition agencies; (4, 3.a, 2.d.i-ii, and 2.c) create the “White House Competition Council”, responsible for coordinating the “Whole-of-Government” competition policy promoted by the EO, e.g. developing procedures for agency cooperation on matters of overlapping jurisdiction in the policing of anticompetitive conduct and the oversight of mergers; (2.g and 2.d.iii) state that agencies can and should adopt pro-competitive regulations and rescind regulations that create unnecessary barriers to entry.

This paper will build upon current findings summarized above through additional country and international organization contributions, and focusing on the three sets of regulatory governance issues stressed in the preceding paragraph.

0,"The current and severe economic crisis registered in the history of Brazil, accentuated by the COVID-19 pandemic, in addition to the slow and constant weakening of critical institutions, such as the judiciary and the press, significantly weaken the growth of democracy; besides resulting in the impossibility of any plausible composition of political forces to govern the country  within  the  framework  of  the  democratic  constitution.  The  neoliberal  economic policies, proposed by the current Bolsonaro government, are ineffective and unpopular, and, nevertheless,  most  political  parties  are  implicated  in  an  endless  series  of  scandals  in corruption and fraud, highlighted recently -for example, by Car Wash’s operation. Added to these facts of imbalance, the ongoing partisan polarization, which is based not on terms of right  and  left,  but  on  religion  and  conservatism,  also  signals  the  weakening  of  the  young Brazilian  democracy.  To  this  end,  the  Bolsonaro  government  indicates  possible  action  to solve these impasses through authoritarian actions, implying that political disputes will tend to be resolved outside the constitution. Should democracy be dislodged by a military coup, considering that most of the ministers of the current government are military, this could mark the end of a democraticexperience that marked a few republican generations, and which, to the extent of the proportions, achieved significant successes. A new set of democratic forces and institutions are urgently needed in order to confront the forces of obscurantism that havetaken over the Brazilian nation. In this context, the present project aims to analyze: (i) the relationship and implications of the threat to democracy, through the actions of the Bolsonaro government;  (ii)  the  skepticism regarding  the amount  of fragmentation  of  political parties investigated for corruption; and (iii) the diversity of political agents who are investigated for corruption and fraud, either in the most varied governmental spheres. Thus, by means of a theoretical-empirical analysis, we intend to identify the main implications of these relations on the autonomy and independence of democratic institutions. The theoretical argument will be illustrated based on the case of Brazil, particularizing the link between the populism of previous rulers and the arrival of a president with authoritarian characteristics. The empirical results,  in turn,  will be  based  on the  possible  relations  of  corruption  with  political  parties, income inequality,  economic  growth,  fragility  of  democracy,  among  other  variables.It  is expected to  discuss,  through  the  results  obtained,  whether  the  Brazilian  political  system  is supported by a robust and persistent corruption structure over the years, the effectiveness of the shift to an authoritarian neoliberalism as a way to break with the stagnation of economic growth presented in  recent years  by leftist governments,  and the  quality  of  the  democratic pillars that sustain the Brazilian reality.",Mackenzie Presbyterian University,,,,,,,,Mackenzie Presbyterian University,,Samuel Mamede,,,,,,,,Samuel Mamede,,Democracy,Elites,Political Parties,Populism,Corruption,Ethics,Judicialisation,,"The relationship between the threat to democracy, pessimism towards political parties, and the increase in corruption: the Brazilian reality",https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64542&EventID=185
0,"The citizens of Palestinian and Kurdish descent in Israel and Turkey numerically constitute the biggest ethnic and linguistic minority by a wide margin in their respective countries and have a long history of ethnopolitical struggle for their collective rights. Palestinian and Kurdish political movements initially formed alliances with the Jewish and Turkish left and gradually developed their independent, organized nationalist political parties. Although minority political activism in Israel and Turkey has been dominated by secular movements for decades, with the rise of ethnoreligious parties, the pro-Palestinian United Arab List (Ra’am) and the pro-Kurdish Free Cause Party (Hüda-Par), the religious-secular cleavage became a salient source of ideological contest among minority political entrepreneurs. The religious and secular factions of minority movements broadly differ in their relations with the Israeli and Turkish states. While the secular pro-Palestinian parties have been systematically excluded from government coalitions and decision-making bodies, Ra’am became the first Arab party in Israel’s history to join a governing coalition. In the general elections of November 2015, the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) made an informal coalition with the Huda-Par against the secular Kurdish nationalists and often held official meetings and festive visits with party representatives. Why have the Israeli and Turkish governments developed more accommodative relations with the Islamist factions of Palestinian and Kurdish politics while treating secular minority parties as “natural born oppositions” and excluding them from political consideration? The literature suggests that the religious-secular divide is a key fault line in explaining the formation of political cleavages and party competition in the Middle East. For one view, the existence of relevant social divisions in the electorate; for another, the weakness of leftwing parties in appealing to the large segments of society has led to the formation and strengthening of religious parties in the region. However, most studies of the religious-secular cleavage do not pay much attention to the nature of relations between ethnic minority parties and the state within the context of ethnically divided societies. Moreover, comparative assessments of the fragmentary nature of minority political parties are mainly absent from the literature. Based on a qualitative content analysis of press releases and statements made by government officials, this study attempts to fill this gap by focusing on the state’s diverse strategies towards ethnic minority parties as a potential factor accentuating the religious-secular cleavage and political polarization among minority populations in Israel and Turkey from a comparative perspective.",Antalya Bilim University,,,,,,,,Antalya Bilim University,,Aslı Elitsoy,,,,,,,,Aslı Elitsoy,,Cleavages,Ethnic Conflict,Islam,Political Parties,Comparative Perspective,,,,The Religious-Secular Cleavage and Ethnic Minority Parties: A Comparative Perspective from Israel and Turkey,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63970&EventID=185
0,"Hillary Clinton, on losing the 2016 presidential election, faced criticism for failing to mobilise a voting “gender gap” in her favour, but greater support among men than women consistently characterised Donald Trump as a politician. Even if, to be sure, among white women Trump’s margin over Clinton was nine percentage points, this was broadly in line with other presidential elections of the twenty-first century. Among women as a whole, Clinton was stronger than Trump by thirteen points. Despite the exceptional nature of Trump’s political idiosyncrasies, the maleness as well as the whiteness of his electoral foundation has long characterised the Republican Party as a whole. This paper explores the relationship between the Republican Party and the gender gap in longer-term perspective, asking why – and with what consequences – its base acquired this nature.
Although it was in 1980 that the arrival of the gender gap – according to which more men than women voted for Ronald Reagan and the Republicans – won public attention, even in the 1960s politicians were starting to notice a decline in a traditional association between women and conservatism. Whereas the Republican hostility to ‘big government’ alienated women in greater numbers than men, the new convergence between conservatism and populism mobilised men more strongly. Over time, it was at best in an ineffectual manner that Republicans tackled the problem of their declining support among women; on the one hand, their party possessed an ideological preference for smaller government, and on the other, Richard Nixon influentially pioneered a political appeal implicitly – though not explicitly – targeted at men. Meanwhile, the normative consequences for policy as well as a politics of a party system within which gender- as well as race-based cleavages were significant received little scrutiny.
If the gendered nature of Trump’s appeal, in interaction not only with race but also with personal characteristics such as marital status and level of education, formed part of the Republican Party’s evolution since the 1960s, Trump embraced yet more strenuously the assertive populism that had helped to foster these electoral disparities between men and women. Doing so helped to define the party in his own mould as well as foster instability within the political system. The paper investigates how the Trump administration followed an agenda according to which there was governing as well as campaigning in mobilisation of a gender gap.",University of Edinburgh,,,,,,,,University of Edinburgh,,Robert Mason,,,,,,,,Robert Mason,,Gender,Political Parties,USA,Qualitative,Activism,,,,The Republican Party and the voting “gender gap” in historical perspective,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=66112&EventID=185
0,"Trump’s presidency has been widely perceived as a turning point in US foreign policy, with a definitive shift away from the previous bipartisan consensus towards a more nationalist attitude. According to previous analyses, Trump’s populist leadership constitutes an anomaly and was responsible for this shift, taking the GOP by storm and imposing his world views and erratic style on the party. Following this view, it is often assumed that many Republicans just ‘went along’ with Trump’s policies and rhetoric to profit from his extensive voter base. This paper challenges this notion of an ‘opportunistic short-term change in foreign policy positioning’ of GOP members during Trump’s presidency, and asks whether it (still) holds under present circumstances. Instead, it is posited that the Republicans’ departure from the bipartisan consensus has been accelerated by Trump’s presidency – having a lasting influence on the Republican Party. Considering the current war in Ukraine, and since the bipartisan consensus entails the maintaining of alliances and curbing the influence of rivals (e.g., Russia), a particular focus will be on the development of the GOP’s policy towards NATO and Russia. By drawing on discourse-bound identity theory and discourse analysis, the GOP’s discourse regarding foreign policy issues is expected to have substantially changed following Trump’s presidency. The paper will analyse the statements of prominent Republicans on foreign policy after Biden’s election, compare them to Trump’s positions on these issues and identify whether there is an overall shift in rhetoric and positions.",Universität Passau,,,,,,,,Universität Passau,,Eva Rieger,,,,,,,,Eva Rieger,,Foreign Policy,Political Parties,USA,Qualitative,Political Ideology,,,,The Republican Party’s Foreign Policy Positioning: From Trump to Trumpists?,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=66114&EventID=185
0,"The Republican People's Party of Turkey (RPP), the founding actor of the secular nation-state, is currently the main opposition party against the religiously-oriented government party, Justice and Development Party (JDP). The latest hegemonic studies on the RPP have defined the party as a “Jacobin-minded” party with a “rigid” understanding of secularism as imposing on people Western values “alien to the fabric of the society”. Nevertheless, the party has been internally and externally struggling to redefine itself for nearly a decade. A “softer” version of secularism, compatible with the Habermasian post-secular public sphere, is on the table for at least three reasons. First, rather than an ideological reconfiguration, the transformation of the party regarding its outlook on secularism is portrayed as a strategic move. The party has been seeking a broad political alliance with right-wing parties in order to defeat President Erdoğan, an alliance that covers not only center-right parties but also Islamist parties even including those of former JDP leaders. Second, as the party turns into a center of attraction for oppressed and excluded groups of any type (from LGBT community to outsider religious orders), it has been under the growing impact of politics of identity. A pressure from inside and outside forces the party to adopt a libertarian and multiculturalist framework in approaching the role of religion in public sphere. Third, as a claimant to power, the party is concerned with displaying its commitment to neoliberal governmentality. Religious organizations are considered as legitimate agents of charity and cultural identity-based solidarity that replaced welfare state and class-based solidarity in the neoliberal age, a trend which the RPP has to align with as a mainstream party. In the presentation, these factors and their embodiments will be elaborated. On the other hand, as the JDP continues to pursue an anti-secular agenda, the RPP also feels a reverse pressure that brings back the religious-secular cleavage. Religious orders’ heavy hand on children and young adults, escalating violence against women, as well as the grip of conservative climate on arts and culture are currently leading to political controversy. Defining secularism as a pluralist principle and a matter of respect for all lifestyles and ideas seems unconvincing to many RPP voters, which creates tensions within the party and makes it fall behind the secular public opinion and activism in certain cases. Such pressures on the party will also be examined in the presentation, with an aim of foreseeing the RPP’s leaning in the near future. Official statements of the party as well as social media coverage regarding the party’s and its critics’ attitudes will be analyzed to that end.",Dokuz Eylül University,,,,,,,,Dokuz Eylül University,,Ilkim Ozdikmenli Celikoglu,,,,,,,,Ilkim Ozdikmenli Celikoglu,,Islam,Political Parties,Religion,Identity,Public Opinion,,,,The Republican People's Party of Turkey between the classical and new understandings of secularism,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=62358&EventID=185
0,"The paper investigates the process of placemaking in Kibera, one of the largest informal settlements in Nairobi. It approaches the placemaking as being shaped by two distinct forces – the normative urban planning and the production of lived-spaces by the residents themselves. The key unit of the research is chill-spot, a mode of sociability spontaneously produced by the residents themselves. The inhabitants refer to the chill-spots as the drivers of the local development where one can come and get the support from other members of the community. The production of chill-spots is, however, strictly tied to the spontaneous character of informal public space.
In the ethnographic research I focus on the role of chill-spots and their transformation during the massive construction of new roads in 2022 in Kibera. While the formal infrastructures bring such values as accessibility, it also creates a pressure on the lived-spaces of the residents. The construction of formal infrastructures inevitably creates a formalised public space that is tied to many regulations and challenges the spontaneous function of informality. 
The emphasis on the chill-spots thus sheds more light on the processes taking place between the formal and informal parts within the postcolonial city. It also navigates our attention closer to the organic needs of the residents of the informality. As a result, the fieldwork interprets chill-spots as not only drivers of community development, but also as facilitators of community identity that should not be neglected in the formal city planning.",Metropolitan University Prague,,,,,,,,Metropolitan University Prague,,Martin PAV,,,,,,,,Martin PAV,,Africa,Development,Globalisation,Identity,NGOs,,,,The Right to Idle: Social construction of “chill-spots” – modes of sociability in African informal settlements,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64206&EventID=185
0,"In this paper I develop an explanatory approach to the specific social conditions and power-political contingency margins of alternative variants of populism in Spain, focusing on how the strategies and hegemonic positions of different political actors have developed in Spain since the crisis-related reorganization processes. For the empirical basis of this paper, I draw on my ongoing Ph.D. research. To approach these issues, I’m conducting a qualitative media and document analysis and expert interviews. Initial findings indicate that the Spanish state apparatus ensemble, due to its historical development, has always had a tendency towards authoritarian elements. However, the developments toward neoliberalism, authoritarian competitive statism and fragmented hegemony have intensified and solidified enormously during the crisis processes in Spain. The euro crisis and the protest movements around 15-M seem to have acted as a destitute moment in which the previous social and hegemonic order was called into question. The Spanish government reacted to this political uprising with more repression. This situation enabled new actors to enter the political arena and made new forms of politics (populism) necessary to achieve hegemony. Furthermore, first findings indicate that power actors are split between and within themselves. As a result of the crisis processes that have been ongoing in recent years, a division and attempts of reorganization are taking place.",Philipps-Universität Marburg,,,,,,,,Philipps-Universität Marburg,,Johanna Schafgans Muñoz,,,,,,,,Johanna Schafgans Muñoz,,Civil Society,Populism,Critical Theory,Southern Europe,State Power,Eurozone,,,The Rise of Populism in Spain – An Analysis of Hegemonic Struggles and Shifts in Power Relations,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63662&EventID=185
0,"In the aftermath of the financial and sovereign debt crises, Southern European party systems were shaken by the rise of new or, until then, only marginal challenger parties that combined a strong critique of the political establishment with marked anti-neoliberal and anti-austerity positions. Despite differences in their ideological underpinnings and electoral trajectories, all parties had initially presented themselves as alternatives to the mainstream Left and adopted, to a varying degree, populist discourse and mobilization strategies. Between 2015 and 2018, Syriza in Greece, Podemos in Spain, the Five Star Movement in Italy and the Left Bloc in Portugal had either entered office or started granting parliamentary support to socialist-led minority governments. By taking stock of the parties’ policy-making experiences in governments and parliaments, the paper provides a comparative assessment of their policy stances in the realm of welfare before and after they reached power. Methodologically, it relies on quantitative and qualitative analyses of electoral manifestos and programmatic statements retrieved from the parties’ official websites (policy documents, interviews, press releases), taking into account the timespan from the onset of the financial crisis (for Syriza and the Left Bloc) or the parties’ creation (for the Five Star Movement and Podemos) throughout their policy-making experience, i.e. as governmental partners or parliamentary allies to the ruling party. The analysis considers both proposed and adopted policies and explores which sub-policy areas are prioritized by the four parties in the welfare realm, which social risks are addressed and which main beneficiaries are targeted. The aim of the paper is to investigate how welfare policy is shaped by populist challenger parties from the Left once they reach relevant policy-making positions, how their policy agenda evolves as they progressively institutionalize and in what ways populism influences the content of their policy proposals. The intended contribution is two-fold: firstly, the paper complements the research currently being developed on the socioeconomic stances of right-wing challenger and populist parties, by focusing on their counterparts on the left; secondly, it examines ‘new left’ parties emerged in a context of deep economic and political crisis and their social policy stances from a programmatic perspective, namely the ‘supply side’ of policy-making, shedding light on a potentially renewed partisan dimension of welfare politics and the role of populism in shaping social policy.",Scuola Normale Superiore,,,,,,,,Scuola Normale Superiore,,Beatrice Carella,,,,,,,,Beatrice Carella,,Comparative Politics,Policy Analysis,Populism,Social Policy,Welfare State,Southern Europe,,,The rise of populist challengers from the Left: implications for welfare politics in crisis-ridden Southern Europe,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65514&EventID=185

0,"MPs in western parliamentary democracies are increasingly recruited from the large group of political insiders, such as special advisers, political assistants, spokespersons, civil servants, lobbyists, or campaign managers. They have earned their living in or around the houses of Parliament, before embarking on a political career. We call these political insiders para-politicians. Just as paramedics are not doctors themselves, para-politicians do not hold political office, but do work in the political realm, providing support and advice. They are the political equivalents of the practice nurse, the operating assistant and the speech therapist.
In this paper we map this relatively new career path, focussing on the Dutch Parliament. First, we clarify and operationalize the concept, compare this new venue to older pathways to parliament, and outline the broader context. We then present data on the extent to which the members of the Dutch House of Representatives have a para-political background and whether we can observe differences between parties. Also, we show that MPs who have followed this career path have much more prominent positions in the parliamentary groups.

0,"Running a negative campaign is often seen as risky for a politician because it may backfire. This has led to a substantial body of empirical work which examines whether negative campaigning helps or hurts the candidates who engage in this tactic on average. However, the focus on the average may follow the colloquial definition of risk, as something bad that may happen, but not the decision-theoretical definition. According to this definition, risk is not the average outcome, but the variance of the (expected) outcome. I will argue that a decision-theoretical assessment of negative campaigning provides an interesting new perspective. 
According to decision theory, risk is not necessarily a bad thing. Its (un)desirability depends on the preferences of the decision maker and, more importantly in this case, on the situation. For example, a candidate who can expect to lose when nothing changes may benefit from ‘shaking things up’. Either she will lose by a landslide (which seems not much worse than losing by a thinner margin) or she may eke-out a win. In this paper I will analyse this problem theoretically, considering both optimal and boundedly rational decision making by candidates.
This decision-theoretical perspective also raises new empirical questions. Firstly, is negative campaigning really riskier in a decision theoretical sense? Or put differently, are election results more variable when one or more candidates engage in negative campaigning? I will assess this question by reanalysing data on the effects of negative campaigning.

0,"“Atonement” is one of many possibilities for a perpetrator state regarding its historical legacy. As a state practice, it comprises an official, political apology and the offer of reparation payments to former victim states. While in today’s world, such a package holds almost immediate normative appeal, it nevertheless was practiced only once on the bilateral level, between West Germany and Israel, initiated by the Reparations Agreement signed in 1952. To understand why and how atonement emerges as a state practice, this paper inquires into its origins in international politics. With this, the paper departs from existing explanations that either view atonement as a domestic political strategy or a normative choice on the part of incumbent politicians. Instead, this paper locates the initial spark for and interest in atonement in international incentive structures and the bilateral inter-agency between a former perpetrator state and its victim. To illustrate the plausibility of these claims, the paper empirically analyses the beginnings of the West German interest in atonement, highlighting the international factors that formed the idea of reparation payments to Israel into a strategic political decision in 1952. Finally, and to showcase the paper’s contribution, the West German study is compared with two examples of “non-atonement”: post-war Austria and Japan. Altogether, the findings then tell us why atonement comes about as a state practice, and how – irrespective of whether it is morally desired by political leaders – atonement can constitute a country’s best strategic option within its international relations.",University of Oxford,,,,,,,,University of Oxford,,Kathrin Bachleitner,,,,,,,,Kathrin Bachleitner,,Conflict,International Relations,Memory,Narratives,,,,,The Road towards Atonement in International Relations: How to enable official apologies and reparations between states,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63084&EventID=185
0,"The shift in US agricultural policies towards crop insurance and away from direct payments to farmers would at first appear to reflect the dominance of a competitive-market paradigm and a post-exceptional or even non-exceptional view of agriculture. This paper explores an alternative interpretation: that crop insurance – both in terms of policy motivation and as a policy instrument has evolved into farm income support through other means. This possibility raises conceptual and empirical questions regarding the nature of agriculture policy reform. At a conceptual level, the shift toward crop insurance illustrates that ideas are less of a constraint on policymakers as the concept of policy paradigms suggests. Instead, ideas serve as resources that policymakers employ selectively and strategically. At an empirical level, the shift toward crop insurance illustrates how constellations of interests entrench and institutionalize new policy instruments in the existing policy regime. Using text analysis of congressional hearings and quantitative analysis of lobbying reports, we explore the role of ideas and interests in the adoption of crop insurance in the United States. Our findings have implications for understanding agricultural policy reform. The case of crop insurance suggests that post-exceptionalism can be understood as a process whereby policy makers creatively rearticulate existing policy goals to meet new political circumstances and seek to entrench these reimagined policies in durable coalitions of powerful interests.",Radboud Universiteit Nijmegen,Johns Hopkins University,,,,,,,Radboud Universiteit Nijmegen,,Gerry Alons,Adam Sheingate,,,,,,,Gerry Alons,,Public Policy,USA,Mixed Methods,Policy Change,,,,,The role of crop insurance in US farm policy: a post-exceptionalist analysis,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63960&EventID=185
0,"Background: Contact tracing is considered as one of the safest and least invasive public health interventions to curb disease outbreaks. Since the beginning of the pandemic, digital contact tracing (DCT) tools have been implemented and deployed in European countries as a novel technology to slow the spread of COVID-19. European governments were the major driving force behind the design and implementation of DCT solutions ensuring the enforcement of data protection and privacy laws and having an active role of both a “scriptwriter” and “performer” of innovative solutions.  In spite of this, the success of COVID-19 DCT tools was severely hampered, resulting in differences in their uptake across Europe. The aim of this study is to explore the reasons for the barriers to DCT usage in Europe in the light of emerging ethical, privacy and data protection concerns in a rapidly changing political interplay between policymakers and the public.

Methods: We analysed the use of DCT tools in European countries in the light of declining trust in national governments. In order to better understand the reasons behind the low usage rates of DCT tools and establish an association between the use of mobile tracking apps and social trust in public policies during the pandemic, we compared the number of mobile tracking apps downloads (% of population, used as a surrogate for DCT usage), with OECD’s trust in government indicator. Furthermore, relevant policy measures towards implementing DCT solutions are explored and a summary of DCT solutions’ usage statistics in European countries alongside the applicable data protection legislation such as GDPR is provided as a basis for future discussions.

Results: Discernible gaps in DCT tools’ usage were identified across Europe with the higher usage rates of DCT mobile apps being positively correlated with an increased trust in governments. Despite possible confounders, these results point to a link between the use of digital health technology and citizens’ trust in policymaking. As the main drivers of DCT innovation efforts during the pandemic, governments were under an increased scrutiny by the public resulting in differences in the DCT uptake.

Conclusion: Digital innovations are usually seen as objective public health interventions that are detached from the trust invested in the governments’ decisions. Nevertheless, social trust seems to be crucial to managing public health crises, especially when the public opinion is crucial to digital health technologies’ uptake. The results of this research show the link between the citizens’ trust in their governments and the use of innovative DCT technologies during the COVID-19 pandemic. Speedy recovery of European societies requires an integration of reliable digital health technologies into trustworthy policymaking, as one is not effective without the other. A comprehension of the public as the main actor in the implementation of such solutions is crucial for this and possible future pandemics.","University of Zagreb, Faculty of Medicine",,,,,,,,"University of Zagreb, Faculty of Medicine",,Vanja Pajić,,,,,,,,Vanja Pajić,,International,Comparative Perspective,Public Opinion,Technology,Policy-Making,,,,The role of European governments in implementing digital health innovations amidst declining public trust: A case of Digital Contact Tracing (DCT) tools for COVID-19,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65799&EventID=185
0,"Weapons of mass destruction, in particular nuclear arms, pose a significant threat to global and human security. A human-centred approach towards outlawing these weapons was advocated by the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons (ICAN) in cooperation with like-minded states and international organizations. This resulted in the adoption of the Treaty on the Prohibition of the Nuclear Weapons (TPNW) and its entry into force in January 2021, which constitutes an important milestone in nuclear disarmament. 

The existing research on nuclear disarmament extensively covers the TPNW and its transformative role regarding changing of norms, narratives and discourses, as well as the role of the ICAN and grassroots activism. However, less is known about the role of expertise by experts, think tanks, scholars. In particular, we know little about the relationship between these actors and states with respect to the production of such norms and regarding nuclear policy knowledge in general. Case studies on think tanks in Austria and Germany allow us to address the research gap on the role of expertise and impact of external along with internal factors on nuclear knowledge production. A qualitative inquiry employs in-depth semi-structured interviews with the leadership of experts from 6 think tanks in these two countries. Guided by the building blocks paradigm, this comparative study regards nuclear disarmament from the perspective of positive peace. The transformative research approach allows the construction of new thought patterns related to knowledge production, in this case in the field of nuclear disarmament. The findings of this empirical cross-nations research contribute to scholarship on nuclear weapons, European studies, the politics of knowledge and peace research.

0,"Starting from the idea that workplaces matter, this paper presents a meso-level explanation for the rise of anti-system political behavior. It relates recent findings in labor economics showing that firms have strong and increasing independent effects on the structure of opportunities, wages, and benefits in geographically bounded labor markets with relational inequality theory. By focusing on the effects that low-road firm strategies have on economic trajectories and expectations of workers and business, this paper proposes a novel approach for explaining the rise of far-right anti-system parties in Western Europe that seeks to reconcile and bridge the gaps in the economic and cultural explanations of this phenomenon.

Organizational changes in production and firm strategies have reshuffled both the amount and quality of opportunities as well as who can access them. I sustain that low-road firm-level strategies and their interaction with local production profiles are likely to produce these effects independently of macro trends that the literature associates with the rise of anti-system parties. The switch to low-road firm strategies has effects through two channels that can feed ""loose"" anti-system coalitions. First, it moves workers to a lower relative position, as wage-rents decrease and within firm-inequality increases. Second, it decreases rents and market shares and drives out of business firms with more traditional employment strategies.

To test these claims, I use the expansion of large retail stores in the economically successful regions of Italy’s North, where small shops and craft production were dominant, as a test case of an exogenous entry of firms with different internal strategies. Retail is a typical sector where chains have led to low-road employment strategies, declining rents, and the breakup of local economic complexes, even while productivity increased. Exploiting a national rule enacted in 1998 (the Bersani Law) that allowed regions to set different limits to large retail stores in their provinces, I present a differences-in-differences design to identify the political effects of retail store liberalization in the period after the rule was introduced. 

Using a panel of municipality-level vote shares I find that a higher level of liberalization to the entry of large retailers leads to a large and significant increase in the Lega Nord vote share. In addition, using an individual-level panel survey fielded in 2001 and 2006 I find that, after controlling for respondent and time effects, time-varying provincial-level economic conditions, and region-time effects, within Northern Italy, respondents based in provinces that were assigned higher levels of retail liberalization in the post-treatment period are significantly more likely to report negative individual and sociotropic evaluations of the economic situation, to express higher distrust towards the government, and to be more likely to have voted for the Lega Nord. The effects are larger among small business owners and autonomous workers, showing the effects run partly through the negative impact large retail stores have on the local petty bourgeoisie. The results support the hypothesis that low-road firm strategies can feed anti-system politics even in contexts where macro-level economic trends would not predict it.",Massachusetts Institute of Technology,,,,,,,,Massachusetts Institute of Technology,,Matias Giannoni,,,,,,,,Matias Giannoni,,Political Economy,Populism,Business,Quantitative,Electoral Behaviour,Experimental Design,Southern Europe,,The Role of Firms in the Rise of Anti-System Politics,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64633&EventID=185
0,"Considering the massive environmental and sustainability issues associated with current food production and consumption systems, food policy councils (FPCs) have recently emerged as a promising institutional response.
To date, the scant scientific literature on FPCs is primarily focused on empirical cases, while we still lack a conceptual understanding: Are FPCs a form of policymaking? Do they mainly serve an advisory function? Or are they a form of political advocacy? For each of these, different academic literatures are relevant. Therefore, this study aims to shed light on the emerging institutional phenomenon by disentangling the concept and by synthesizing the various aspects specific to FPCs. 
To this end, we firstly review the existing literature in terms of historical development, types and functions of FPCs. Secondly, we study the institutional phenomenon from three different theoretical angles in order to examine different roles of FPCs in policy-making processes. Results of both analyses will coalesce in a typology capturing the identified aspects of key relevance to FPCs and accounting for variations in their manifestation. The three suggested types reflect FPCs´ dominating manner of exercising influence on food policy: advocacy, advice or governance.

0,"Progressive global warming is projected to result in severe and unreversible consequences for the earth’s climate system, ecosystem, and human societies in the future. Given these long-term consequences of climate change, any adequate response to it has to consider the well-being of unborn generations. Nevertheless, political short-termism—a tendency to favor near-term benefits over future potential gains—is pervasive over contemporary politics in electoral democracies. For instance, in 2021, Germany’s highest court ruled that its climate change legislation violates the rights of future generations and has ordered its government to revise that legislation. 

This paper aims to examine the role of future-oriented institutions in democratic politics. Since the publication of the Brundtland Report in 1987, several electoral democracies have established future-oriented institutions to enhance sustainable development or safeguard the interests of future generations from political short-termism. Today, one of the most famous institutions in the world would be the Future Generations Commissioner for Wales, appointed in 2016. 

There is already a rich literature reviewing the types and designs of future-oriented institutions, which provides a better understanding of how they behave for sustainable development or the interests of future generations. However, the fields of democratic theory and empirical political science still lack a holistic discussion on how different future-oriented institutions could contribute to the quality of democratic systems while safeguarding the interests of future generations from political short-termism. Arguably, the primary task of future-oriented institutions would be mitigating or overcoming political short-termism. Still, there is room for asking how these institutions work in democratic systems. 

We examine the role of future-oriented institutions in electoral democracies, drawing on a functionalist approach to the democratic process. According to the functionalist framework, there are key functions by which a political system counts as democratic: empowered inclusion, agenda-setting, collective will-formation, decision-making, and accountability. Based on this analytical framework, our working hypothesis is that future-oriented institutions work in democratic systems differently depending on their institutional designs. For instance, some future-oriented institutions may function as advocacy representatives of future generations in agenda-setting or collective will-formation processes. Others may also contribute to enhancing the discursive accountability of politicians to citizens. To illustrate these points, we will explore case studies of future-oriented institutions, including the Finnish Parliamentary Committee for the Future, the Commission for Future Generations of the Knesset (the Israeli Parliament), the Hungarian Parliamentary Commissioner for Future Generations, the Future Generations Commissioner for Wales, and the Climate Assembly UK.  

For political scientists and theorists, this paper will help provide a framework for analyzing different future-oriented institutions in terms of their functions and roles in democratic systems. Additionally, the paper will offer suggestions for practitioners and policy-makers on establishing future-oriented institutions in electoral democracies while acknowledging different potential effects derived from the difference in institutional designs on democratic systems.",National Institute for Environmental Studies,University of Zurich,National Institute for Environmental Studies,,,,,,University of Zurich,,Yasuko Kameyama,Masakazu Ogami,Tomohiro Tasaki,,,,,,Masakazu Ogami,,Democracy,Environmental Policy,Institutions,Representation,Climate Change,Policy-Making,,,The role of future-oriented institutions in politics of climate change,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65962&EventID=185
0,"This paper addresses the theme of local political tensions in climate-related politics in a crucial area for climate mitigation - the transport sector, which is responsible for a third of all carbon emissions.  Much of the decarbonization  of the transport system is expected to happen at the local level and we study municipal decision-making on sustainable transport planning in Sweden. Our discussion is based on a qualitative case study of eight Swedish municipalities that have shown to perform well on sustainable transport. We are interested in the norms that shape decision making in these municipalities and how they relate to gender on the one hand and to politics and political tensions on the other. Gender is relevant because sustainable and low-carbon transport choices, i.e., cycling, walking and public transport, are also the preferred transport choices of women thus, with a potential to be a win-win strategy. Transport planning in Swedish municipalities is strongly connected with the views and agendas of the political parties represented in the Technical Committees (TC) responsible for transport planning. That is, decision makers in TCs are actors with political agendas that operate with certain norms and shape decision making.  
Norms affect sustainability work (Hultman, 2016). In particular, policy making and planning is guided by entrenched norms that effect policy by providing the conditions for action (Kulawik, 2009). In recent studies of Swedish municipal transport planning, Kronsell et al (2020) and Dymén et al (2017) point out that gendered norms play an important role in how sustainability is shaped, understood and conveyed in practice. For instance, they show that feminine sustainability norms contain and promote a more holistic, inclusive and just view of sustainability which in turn is connected with the promotion of more sustainable transport choices and behavior. We rely on theoretical work on ideal types of gendered sustainability to study what kind of norms have influenced eight Swedish municipalities' (sustainable) transport policies 2015-2020.
The analysis is based on 13 semi-structured interviews with local politicians (10) and civil servants (3), a qualitative text analysis of 699 documents and protocols from decision making meetings in municipal committees responsible for transport planning (Technical committees) including vision and strategic documents that span 2015-2020 from eight municipalities in Sweden. The material was coded and analyzed with Atlas.ti software.
This paper contributes to better understanding how gender and political ideals relate to municipal decision-making on sustainable transport planning. We elaborate on whether and how gendered sustainability norms are used and integrated into actual decision making, what role gendered norms play in conflicts of priorities within transport politics and planning, and what implications this has for sustainable transport planning in Sweden. The results point at the ways in which gendered norms together with political agendas and priorities, different interpretations and understandings of sustainability and ways to achieve it, can impact the development of sustainable transport system on municipal level.",University of Gothenburg,University of Gothenburg,,,,,,,University of Gothenburg,,Annica Kronsell,Olga Stepanova,,,,,,,Olga Stepanova,,Gender,Green Politics,Local Government,Climate Change,Energy,,,,The role of gendered norms and politics in the shaping of sustainable transport planning in Swedish municipalities,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65145&EventID=185
0,"Post-colonial states and settler nations are increasingly facing pressures to come to terms with their colonial pasts to redress historical injustices. Governments and stakeholders are increasingly looking for ways to address the legacies that the colonial past has in present social injustice and structural inequalities. One such mechanisms are historical commissions. As will be referred to in this paper, historical commissions are ad hoc investigative bodies sanctioned by the state to clarify the historical facts surrounding injustices or crimes committed in a distant past seeking to (1) to uncover or clarify specific events relating to past abuses; and (2) contribute to processes of recognition, accountability, and redress on the basis thereof. 

Although such commissions originated outside the field of transitional justice, they have increasingly been adopting the language and logic of the field. This paradigm shift has been particularly noticeable within post-colonial states and settler nations. The choice to frame historical commissions as instances of transitional justice can be explained by the fact transitional justice’s core objectives of consolidating just, stable, inclusive and peaceful societies hold great normative appeal for their sanctioning states. This has been the case, for example, of Australia, Canada, Chile and most recently Belgium and the Nordic countries – Norway, Finland, Sweden – have established historical commissions to address the legacies of their colonial past. 

Drawing from these cases, the conference paper reflects on the ways in which such commissions contribute to addressing the legacies of the colonial past – for instance, through the historical clarification of the past, addressing issues of acknowledgement and recognition of past wrongdoing, or by linking the past and the present though historical lines of continuity to uncover the impact of colonialism in the present. On the other hand, the paper will address some of the most salient pitfalls – for example, becoming tactical concessions to avoid deeper systemic reforms, or silencing disruptive discourses whilst focusing on the strategic investigation of events.

While the paper uses specific cases to illustrate the discussion, its broader theoretical and conceptual underpinnings emerge from wider research in which I conducted a thorough examination of twenty-seven historical commissions established in from 1990s in different parts of the world. The examination of the cases provides a robust understanding of the organisational strategies, methods, and challenges of the work of such commissions.

0,"The role of political parties in the politicisation of immigration, understood as the increased salience and polarisation of this topic in public and political debate, is considered by researchers to be crucial. It is even more important than structural factors, such as the scale of immigration or critical events. However, this role still raises many doubts and controversies. The main disagreement is between those who argue that far-right parties have the greatest influence on the politicisation of immigration and those who show that it is mainstream parties, especially centre-right parties or government parties, that play a leading role in this process. This paper aims to present the preliminary results of the study on this topic, conducted in Poland, based on the analysis of parliamentary debates and media statements of party leaders between 2015 (European migration crisis) and 2021 (crisis on the Polish-Belarusian border). In Poland, the process of politicisation of immigration by political parties takes place in a different way than in Western European countries. This is why theoretical concepts explaining the situation in the Western European region do not fully apply to Poland. The main factors contributing to this differentiation seem to be the narrower scope of the functioning of the ‘antipopulist’ norm in Poland and the phase of the migration cycle of Poland, which, unlike Western European countries, has only recently become an immigration country.",University of Warsaw,,,,,,,,University of Warsaw,,Renata Stefańska,,,,,,,,Renata Stefańska,,Political Parties,Immigration,Asylum,,,,,,The role of political parties in the politicisation of immigration in Poland between 2015 and 2021,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65056&EventID=185
0,"Political party think tanks (also known as study centres, scientific institutes or research foundations) are considered to be the brains of political parties. They perform important tasks for the political party and for society as a whole by – amongst other things – conducting and publishing socially relevant research, writing the party manifesto, organizing lectures and events and preparing policy proposals. Despite their crucial role in various political systems – especially in Western Europe – they have largely escaped academic attention. To examine the role of political party think tanks, the goal of this paper is to develop a comprehensive typology of their role combining the literatures on political party functions and think tank functions on the one hand and taking into account the target audience on the other hand. This leads to a matrixed typology that focuses on whether the role of the party think tanks is internal (focussing on the party, its officials and its members) or external (focussing on society as a whole) and whether they perform political party functions or think tank functions. Evidence for the strength of the matrixed typology is demonstrated by examples extracted from interview-data.

0,"Since 2014, there has been a greater emphasis on the need for governments to develop programmes to rehabilitate and reintegrate violent extremists, yet many programmes are witnessing a community backlash to reintegration. Research demonstrates that the successful reintegration of terrorist offenders and ex-combatants depends upon community support - their acceptance by family, friends, neighbors, and peers and the protective pro-social ties they develop with them. Stigma and public opposition to reintegration can act as barriers to successful reintegration. While existing research has focused on community attitudes to reintegration, the following article examines the drivers of supportive behavior and stigmitizing behavior toward the reintegration of terrorist offenders. We then explore the potential of messaging about rehabilitation programming to generate behavioural support for reintegration through a survey experiment on a representative sample of 1,800 adults in the United Kingdom. Our results show that ethnocentrism predicts an intent of stigmatizing behavior and low supportive behavior toward offenders, fear of terrorism predicts an intent of stigmatizing behavior toward offenders, while high trust in police predicts supportive behavior toward terrorist offenders. Our research finds communication of information a terrorist offender has successfully completed a rehabilitation programme - signalling offender redeemability - increases one measure of supportive behavior (social invitation) and decreases one measure of stigmatising behaviour (avoidance). Our findings have practical significance, highlighting areas which reintegration programmes can focus on to increase community support and decrease stigma and community backlash.

0,"The main scientific goal of this proposed paper is to determine and analyse the functions attributed to religion by President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and the government of the Justice and Development Party (tur. Adalet ve Kalkınma Partisi - AKP) in Turkish foreign policy strategy towards the Western Balkan countries (i.e. Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, Montenegro, North Macedonia, and Serbia). Although secularism in Turkey is a constitutionally protected principle, a gradual return of Islam to the public sphere has been observed since the AKP took power in 2002. Against this background, religious references perform an essential role in a quite unparalleled doctrine of foreign policy that is being implemented by Turkish authorities in neighbouring regions (e.g. Balkan Peninsula). According to its assumptions, Turkey's principal mission is to renew the unity of the Muslim civilisation. Active and flexible diplomacy (both traditional and public), aimed at promoting a socio-political “Turkish model” founded on Islamic values, has been considered as a major tool for applying this vision world-wide. Therefore, the identity-forming function assigned to religion emerges as one of the most pivotal elements of the entire doctrine. 
Adopting a comprehensive approach and a wide research perspective, this proposed paper seeks to explore the formation of relations between Turkey and the Western Balkans in the 21st century. Admittedly, the AKP has strengthened Turkey's position as an important actor in the region, however despite improving its overall image along with enhancing economic and cultural ties with the Western Balkan states, Turkish authorities have still failed to gain any significant political influence. In this regard, this paper attempts to answer the research question of how publicly declared religious motivations for certain political activities affect the effective implementation of Turkish strategic interests in the Western Balkans.
With the purpose of identifying the most relevant decisions and actions related to religious determinants of Turkey’s foreign policy in the region, a broad range of original Turkish sources (government documents, public reports) as well as literature on the subject (academic publications, policy briefs) have been studied. An in-depth survey of interviews and official speeches of Turkish policy-makers was also fundamental for this research. The image theory in international relations, which allows for examination of trends and directions in the state's foreign policy based on analysis of political perceptions, was selected as the theoretical foundation in this study. By employing qualitative research methods (e.g. content analysis, political discourse analysis, historical methods, process tracing method) this paper investigates the role of religion in the political strategy of President Erdoğan and the Justice and Development Party. Accordingly, the research concludes with an assessment of Turkish achievements to date and aims to predict future dimensions of Turkey’s involvement in the Western Balkans.",Jagiellonian University,,,,,,,,Jagiellonian University,,Jan Niemiec,,,,,,,,Jan Niemiec,,Cleavages,Foreign Policy,International Relations,Islam,Religion,Identity,Political Ideology,Empirical,The role of religion in Turkish foreign policy towards the Western Balkans,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63786&EventID=185
0,"In many Western democracies, public policymaking has increasingly been relying on public participation processes, particularly – but not exclusively – at the local and regional level. The ongoing trend towards involving citizens and organised stakeholders in (local) governance processes is associated with various expectations. These include better-informed decision-making through stakeholder expertise, increased acceptance of decisions or the resolution of conflicts. Under which conditions these expectations are met is studied by the social sciences in numerous case studies and few meta-analyses. However, little attention has been devoted to how competent officials and contracted consultants base their decisions on whether to conduct participation (and if yes, by what design) on scientific evidence provided by participation research.

So, how do decision-makers such as public servants and consultants decide on whether and how to design and conduct public participation processes? What information sources do they consult? Do they rely at all on social science evidence? And what are the obstacles and needs regarding the (potential) use of social science evidence, i.e. knowledge transfer? We asked civil servants at municipal, county and state level in Germany who have been involved in organising participation processes, as well as consultants and mediators of these processes. To this end, we combined a standardised online survey (n=67) with qualitative interviews (n=17) and two focus groups (four participants each).

Results show that most public servants and consultants have at least a basic interest in the use of social science evidence for design issues such as the choice of the participation format. However, a majority reports to rarely or never use social science research results for designing or implementing participation processes. Reasons are manifold, including a lack of time on their part and a lack of reliable and accessible evidence. Advice from external and internal colleagues and consultants, training courses, websites and guidelines are the dominant sources of information. Insofar as social science evidence is used, it is primarily utilised as a source of new ideas and concepts for participation, but also as a justification for decisions already taken, or as arguments to intensify participation, when negotiating with superordinate authorities, often at higher levels of governance.

Interviewees also reported that besides the occasional use of social science evidence, decisions on participation design issues are primarily driven by legal and political requirements of the different policy and politics levels, the local ‘participation culture’, resource constraints and personal intuition and experience. Nevertheless, public servants and consultants would welcome evidence at hand that is easy to understand and fast to access, illustrates findings through comparable practical examples, gives concrete recommendations for solving a problem and provides information on measures that have been effective in the past. Some interviewees specifically ask for evidence that does justice to their local context. In general, differences between (potential) evidence user groups are small regarding these questions.

0,"Mitigating and adapting to climate change possess tremendous governance challenges. The polycentric nature of global climate governance gives domestic governments the crucial role in directing climate action. This paper conceptualizes the role of the state in accelerating climate action. While we know quite much about why global climate politics is challenging and how single climate policy instruments works, we have little systematic knowledge about the role of the state in acceleration of climate action. ‘Acceleration of climate action’ refers to processes that increase emission cuts in terms of breadth (range of activities and sectors cutting emissions), depth (size of cuts/uptake/carbon removal) or speed (rate of change). Some types of state involvement might cause positive ‘ambition loops’; others might trigger negative feedback and backlash. While recognizing that states might also decelerate climate action, this paper primarily specify how state-induced acceleration patterns could materialise. Three distinct models for state led climate acceleration are presented and assessed: marked failure, technology transition and popular support. While these are ‘ideal models’, empirical examples of the three are presented. The paper primarily zooms in on differing ways of setting up the ‘machinery of government’, i.e. the governmental apparatus and decision-making processes for acceleration of climate action, and how this may differ across the three models. The differing models give different expectations when it comes to what states could and should do to spur incremental change, sequencing, leapfrogging and tipping-points that over time ensures a development towards resilient societies with net-zero emissions.",Universitetet i Oslo,,,,,,,,Universitetet i Oslo,,Elin Lerum Boasson,,,,,,,,Elin Lerum Boasson,,Environmental Policy,Governance,Climate Change,,,,,,The role of the state in acceleration of climate action,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63426&EventID=185
0,"In spring 2020, Sweden’s official management of the COVID-19 pandemic through a voluntary compliance approach created a flurry of interest, wonder, and puzzlement. It was called “unorthodox”, “a deadly folly”, and a “remarkable exception involving “befuddlingly soft measures”. 

Swedish scholars explain the Swedish approach by Sweden’s unique and exceptional model of governing, in particular the institutional structure of the Swedish public administration and the government’s willingness to delegate public health policymaking to expert-oriented public agencies. However, a central model component not sufficiently uncovered is the role of the special relationship between the Swedish state and its citizens that puts considerable responsibility for the common good into the hands of individual citizens. Two general governing principles underly this relationship: the principle of “freedom with responsibility” and the principle of government steering without coercion, even in crisis situations. Sweden’s COVID-19 approach has, thus, to large degree relied on individual citizens who are expected to be able, ready, and willing to follow official (voluntary) recommendations. This trust-based approach is in stark contrast to many countries that imposed lockdowns backed up by legal sanctions. 
 
The general governing principles involve three implicit assumptions about the role of trust in Swedish society. First, citizens are expected to have political trust in governing institutions, believing that these institutions aim to safeguard both their own and society’s well-being. Therefore, citizens are expected to be willing to (voluntarily) follow their policy measures. Second, citizens are expected to trust each other, to have interpersonal trust, which implies the belief that others mean them no intentional harm and can be expected to act in a pro-social way. As such, citizens are expected to follow recommendations as they expect that others will do so too. Third, the state should be able to depend on its inhabitants to be good citizens who see it as part of their societal responsibility or duty to follow recommendations - even if it requires personal effort and sacrifice for the common good. 

Our study asks what role political trust, interpersonal trust, and citizenship norms have played in Swedish youth’s following of the voluntary COVID-19 recommendations, along with questions about whether their views of how well other people follow them and their own socio-economic circumstances affect their own level of compliance. We focus on Swedish youth as this group of citizens complies less with the COVID-19 measures than other age groups. This makes it particularly important to understand their reasons for (not) following the recommendations.

Our analyses show that young people who adhere to the duty-based citizenship norm, who have more trust in the public health agency, and who believe that others follow the COVID-19 recommendations report to better follow those recommendations themselves. We find no relationship between engaged or critical citizenship norms, interpersonal trust and trust in government, and following the COVID-19 recommendations. These findings have implications for both academic research and public policy in that it helps understand better what promotes youngsters’ pro-social behavior in the pandemic and how the Swedish governing model works in practice.",Stockholm University,Maastricht Universiteit,,,,,,,Maastricht Universiteit,,Michele Micheletti,Soetkin Verhaegen,,,,,,,Soetkin Verhaegen,,Citizenship,Political Engagement,Activism,,,,,,The role of trust and citizenship norms in understanding youth compliance with Sweden’s voluntary approach to the COVID-19 pandemic,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65024&EventID=185

The Covid-19 pandemic has aggravated the living conditions in the countryside, intensifying poverty protests across the region. While rural Tunisia has traditionally been a hotbed of protest against the central authorities and at the origin of the 2011 uprisings, protest movements in Morocco have until recently been a predominantly urban phenomenon. This paper seeks to explain the historical differences regarding rural mobilizations as well as their recent convergence in the two countries. It will identify the relevant actors and their demands, the representation of rural populations in national politics and state responses addressing rural grievances both before and during the pandemic.

0,"Recent developments in contemporary analytic political theory have called for political theory to situate itself very near political science, and following, to ‘scientify’ itself. This call has at times pronounced itself in explicit terms, and at times is sounded via calls for political theorists to pay close attention to the functioning of political institutions and to political data. 
Such calls have brought about a lively debate regarding the form of such empirically grounded political theory, and of course its desirability. The goal of the current article is to clarify what this change would entail. Such a clarification aims to situate ‘scientification’ in contemporary analytic political theory (CAPT) where it arguably belongs - in CAPT’s descriptive and prescriptive steps, and to indicate that scientification should not mean that the evaluative or normative aspect of CAPT would be superseded or extinguished, rather, that the empirical and the evaluative/normative parts can complement each other. The second goal of the article is to argue that if properly understood and situated, scientification of CAPT is a positive development as once properly executed, it would assist empirically grounded CAPT to achieve its own stated goals.
The article begins by exploring and describing recent calls for the scientification of political theory (such as by K. Dowding) and provides a working definition of research in social science that fits the contested term ‘scientific research’ following the characterizations of KKV and Gerring. Following, it attempts to clarify what such scientification would mean in the context of CAPT; in order to do so, it is suggested to divide the structure of CAPT into three parts: (I) description, (II) evaluation and (III) prescription. We then situate the noted scientification within CAPT, using the suggested division of the structure of CAPT to three parts. Following, the scientification of CAPT would chiefly apply to parts I (description) and III (prescription), as both require adequate understanding of the relevant, explored, political behavior or institution.
Section four explores the importance of the scientification of CAPT to the second part of CAPT - evaluation. Here, while the focus is on normative models outside the scope of normal scientific processes, scientification can contribute in at least three major ways; (1) in the clarity of concepts and analysis (inclusive of operationalism of major concepts); (2) in a better understanding of models used in the evaluative step, as such models often share attributes with scientific models, such as proximity and parsimony; and finally (3) scientification is important to the evaluative step as such evaluation ought to be based on an adequate execution of the descriptive part, hence scientification is indispensable for the normative aspects of CAPT.",Bar Ilan University,,,,,,,,Bar Ilan University,,Nahshon Perez,,,,,,,,Nahshon Perez,,Political Methodology,Political Theory,Methods,Normative Theory,Empirical,,,,The scientification of political theory; a clarification and a qualified defense.,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63205&EventID=185
0,"Universities in Eastern and Central Europe seemed to be on a one-way street towards becoming liberal and democratic institutions in the European Union (EU) member countries joining in the 2000s. The Bologna process and the internationalization of labor markets and the European recognition of skills were indicators that convergence at university level had almost been reached. Nonetheless, the political conflict involving the Central and Eastern European University in Budapest in 2020 and its forced relocation to Austria was an indication that this may not have been entirely true. But to which extent has this been a unique development in the region? Have such processes taken place elsewhere in the post-communist space as well? This paper enquires about the processes that could be underlying this politicization of education in former communist countries. Illiberal parties and their influence on education have already been documented in Hungary and Poland. Romania seemed to have escaped the wave, but this is no longer the case either, since AUR has entered parliament.

0,"What are the sources of an international organization’s (IO) discursive legitimation? In this paper, we challenge the existing literature’s focus on the strategic sources of IO legitimation by examining novel data on the democratic legitimation of 28 regional IOs in the period from 1980 until 2019 – a type of IO that faces particular incentives to construct legitimation communication strategically. We argue that socialization and isomorphic legitimation provide theoretically coherent and hitherto neglected alternatives and assess the respective relevance of these general sources of discursive legitimation. Using multilevel regression analysis, we show that all three models offer important insights into IOs’ discursive legitimation. Specifically, the normative convictions of member states and high-level international bureaucrats (socialization legitimation), strategic considerations induced by institutional design and public politicization (strategic legitimation), and geographic diffusion (isomorphic legitimation) all shape IOs’ democratic legitimation discourse. However, the explanatory power of the socialization legitimation model appears to be stronger than that of the strategic and isomorphic models. These results show that the literature’s focus on strategic legitimation is not entirely wrong-headed but neglects other important, sometimes even more important, sources of discursive legitimation.",German Institute for Global And Area Studies,Leuphana Universität Lüneburg,,,,,,,German Institute for Global And Area Studies,,Henning Schmidtke,Tobias Lenz,,,,,,,Henning Schmidtke,,Contentious Politics,Institutions,Communication,,,,,,The Sources of Discursive Legitimation in International Organizations,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63415&EventID=185
0,"A rapidly growing literature is concerned with understanding the drivers of individuals' propensity to spread misinformation on social media. In light of the global COVID-19 pandemic and the widespread dissemination of misinformation about vaccines on the internet, it seems more important than ever to understand how to improve individuals' ability to distinguish between true and false news. In this article, we argue that right-wing authoritarian predispositions play a central role in the spread of misinformation about vaccines. The influence of such predispositions should be particularly pronounced when people make affective decisions, which is common in their real-life social media behaviour. To test these hypotheses, we rely on an innovative JavaScript-based experiment conducted in two Central and Eastern European countries with a particularly high prevalence of misinformation about COVID-19 vaccines: Hungary and Romania. The results of our study support the idea that right-wing authoritarian predispositions significantly amplify the spread of misinformation about COVID-19 vaccines. The influence of such predispositions can also be mitigated only to a limited extent if individuals' attention is explicitly drawn to the accuracy of the information. By highlighting the limitations of what has proven to be one of the most promising interventions against the spread of fake news on social media, our findings have important implications for our understanding of social polarisation and conflict during the COVID-19 crisis.",Johns Hopkins University,European University Institute,,,,,,,European University Institute,,Veronica Anghel,Julia Schulte-Cloos,,,,,,,Julia Schulte-Cloos,,Media,Political Psychology,Populism,Identity,Social Media,Survey Experiments,,,The spread of misinformation about the COVID-19 vaccines in Central and Eastern Europe,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65104&EventID=185
0,"COVID-19 triggered a quick transition in higher education to online environments, with consequences for academic staff as well as students, many of whom have never experienced online education before. This switch has impacted many student groups, none more than international students whose plans of studying abroad were unexpectedly curbed by physical and social restrictions. The transition of on-campus universities to online environments was meant to be an instant solution to a global health crisis. Yet, what started as a quick win became the norm as the pandemic did not subside as fast as expected. This has had serious implications to students’ learning as well as their overall academic experience.

The study under discussion draws on empirical data collected through a qualitative, narrative inquiry study with 28 international students who started their university degrees in UK on campus had to move online during the pandemic. 

This paper explores the experiences of international students during the pandemic in the UK and the implications of emergency online learning to the future of digital education in higher education. We posit that during the pandemic, digital education has often been misconstrued as a traditional form of distance education where the delivery of content is interpreted as the means of fulfilling the purpose of teaching and learning. In so doing, it positions students as knowledge consumers and staff as mere knowledge providers, characterising student learning with a trait of passivity and their relationship with teaching staff and colleagues as an impersonal transaction. Additionally, it points to institutions’ resistance to localising their curricular offering to the new context, instead choosing to transfer practices that have been taken for granted on-campus. This raises two crucial points of discussion:
1)	Firstly, it highlights the lamentable crisis of curriculum research: unable to align research with practice, this has led to the separation of the educational questions ‘what is taught’ from ‘how it is taught’, thus encouraging a rather functionalist view of education, which in the context of the digital, also needs to consider the ‘where’ of teaching relationally.
2)	Secondly, it raises the question regarding the meaning universities attach to ‘student experience’, a concept western universities have been quick to commodify as a key element of the hidden curriculum. Yet, during the pandemic it was not only forgotten but practically obliterated through the choices – or lack of it – universities made to keep afloat. 

We conclude that universities’ disregard for curricular adaptation is damaging to the state of higher education with serious future consequences to how online education is interpreted and valued in relation to on-campus education. There is a real danger that digital education will achieve an even lower status than before, with on-campus education gaining a renewed form of distinction. This has implications to the inclusive and sustainable future of education worldwide.",Durham University,,,,,,,,Durham University,,Cristina Costa,,,,,,,,Cristina Costa,,Critical Theory,Internet,Education,Narratives,Technology,,,,The state of digital education during covid-19 – curriculum politics and the student experience,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65063&EventID=185

0,"Due to the covid-19 pandemic and looming climate change, debates on the role of expertise and scientific knowledge in democratic politics have gained more prominence. In this context, most attention has been paid to the threat of technocracy. As a result, we still lack a proper conceptualization of other forms of science-based policy-making, expertocracy in particular. The presentation offers such a conceptualization. 
The first section ideal-typically distinguishes expertocracy from technocracy and scientific policy advice. Expertocracy is less demanding than technocracy but goes beyond scientific policy advice. Technocracy promises the abolition of politics or its transformation into pure forms of administration and social technology, whereas scientific policy advice has only a servicing function. It is the ""institutionalised delivery of scientific information to political actors"" (Thunert 2001: 224, cited in Weingart & Lentsch 2008: 43, own translation). Expertocracy, occupying a middle position, aims at the scientific rationalisation of politics. Democratically elected representatives shall lose their agenda-setting and leading function and exercise only an instrumental and legitimising function by implementing scientifically based policy programmes and legitimising them to the citizenry. 
The second section elaborates more deeply on how to analyse expertocracy in political life. It conceptualises expertocracy as a thin ideology. Like the thin ideology of populism (Mudde 2004), expertocracy is dualistic or Manichean. It constructs the political space as being divided between two groups, the cognitively competent and the cognitively incompetent. Good policy appears as science-based policy, which is to be determined primarily by scientific procedures and professional expertise, or at least to be complemented by them. Expertocratic ideology describes the “vox scientifica” (Zulianello & Ceccobelli 2020) in a simplified and monistic way, analogous to the vox populi in populism. It suggests that ""science"" offers unambiguous and simple facts, explanations, forecasts, and solutions that can be translated into good policies without taking the conflictual path of imponderable and “irrational” politics. Related to this representation of scientific knowledge is the moralism of expertocratic ideology, which discredits as unreasonable, irresponsible, and immoral all those who supposedly do not give sufficient voice or validity to the vox scientifica. Like populism, expertocracy must be enriched with political content and programmes, or it must be combined with ""thick"" ideologies such as neoliberalism, conservatism, socialism, etc., to become politically viable. Conceptualising expertocracy as a thin ideology thus also takes into account the fact that historically both the left and the right have pursued expertocratic political approaches (Dargent 2015; Etzemüller 2010; Huneeus 2000). 
The presentation concludes with an empirical illustration of the usefulness of this approach. It analyses selected speeches and writings of Luisa Neubauer, a leading figure of the German branch of Fridays for Future. The main focus is on her book “Vom Ende der Klimakrise. Eine Geschichte unserer Zukunft” (together with Alexander Repenning) in which she outlines her political thought more broadly.",Technische Universität Darmstadt,,,,,,,,Technische Universität Darmstadt,,Veith Selk,,,,,,,,Veith Selk,,Democracy,Knowledge,Agenda-Setting,Climate Change,Competence,Political Ideology,,,The thin ideology of expertocracy.

0,"While theories of representation have begun problematizing the relationship between democracy and representation in the last one and a half decade, relatively little attention has been paid to political settings that can neither be considered fully democratic, nor are closed autocracies. The paper aims to contribute to this area of study, by elaborating on the concept of plebiscitary leader democracy (PLD), originally developed by Max Weber, and taken up by contemporary scholars to describe the “grey zone” mentioned above. We argue that Weber’s original, elitistic view of representation (which can be described in broad terms with the following scheme: authorization at elections – acting for the represented – taking responsibility at the next election) can be complemented by an element of responsiveness that, while in line with his skepticism about the possibility of a “self-government of the people”, still pushes the original theory in a more democratic direction. 
The paper captures this element of responsiveness by giving a novel sensorial account of representation, by focusing on the „touch of the leader”, understood in a strictly metaphorical sense. This tactile metaphor might provide an alternative to the traditional „vocal model” where the „voice of the people” (to be heard at elections and protests) is at the center; and to the visual one (present in the writings of constructivist theorists like Ankersmit or Saward), that likens representative claims to the process of depicting or portraying. Applied as an analytical lens, the tactile metaphor can complement our understanding of the central role of leadership in forming the perceptions of the represented (inherent in the Weberian notion of charisma, a central part of PLD). At the same time, it also implies a form of popular presence missing from the vocal and visual metaphors through the proximity of toucher and touched, and their close interaction. On this account, representation in PLD is, in an important sense, negative similitude, a partial imprint that popular attitudes leave on the actions of the representatives.
Such an account, by emphasizing the formative role of leadership and the strong asymmetry between representatives and represented, still shares the most important Weberian premises. At the same time, responsiveness as „being in touch” with the represented, even without them protesting vocally, goes beyond the original Weberian idea of representation (that posited the absence of the represented between elections), and the concomitant „minimalist conception of democracy”, by putting less emphasis on the moments of elections, and assuming a diachronic exploration of popular attitudes. Therefore, a tactile account could yield a realistic critical ideal of tactfulness (borrowed from the „carnal hermeneutics” of Richard Kearney, and given a specific political meaning) for the setting of PLD. This ideal, while obviously falling short of leaders continuously consulting the popular voice, still provides a more realistic goal to aim at in contexts where the judgement of the represented is far from autonomous, and the popular voice is, at best, feeble – conditions presumed by PLD.",Centre for Social Sciences,Centre for Social Sciences,,,,,,,Centre for Social Sciences,,Gábor Illés,András Körösényi,,,,,,,Gábor Illés,,Democracy,Political Leadership,Political Theory,Representation,Constructivism,Identity,,,The Touch of the Leader: A sensorial account of representation in plebiscitary leader democracy,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63913&EventID=185
0,"While the electoral decline of West European Social democracy has received much attention in the literature, considerably less is known about how the structural changes experienced by advanced capitalist societies have affected support for the mainstream right. In this paper, I aim to fill this gap by examining the impact of secularisation and educational expansion on support for all major Conservative and Christian democratic parties in 18 West European democracies since the 1960s. The analysis reveals that secularisation has had a negative impact on the mainstream right's vote share, although this is mainly circumscribed to religious parties (Christian democrats). On the other hand, educational expansion has particularly benefited mainstream right parties with liberal positions on socio-cultural issues, as it has involved the growth of those sectors that are most likely to support their policies. These findings are also supported with individual-level evidence from the European Social Survey 2002-2018.",University of Liverpool,,,,,,,,University of Liverpool,,Raul Gomez,,,,,,,,Raul Gomez,,Cleavages,Comparative Politics,Elections,Religion,Education,Electoral Behaviour,,,The transformation of cleavages and support for the mainstream right: the roles of secularisation and educational expansion,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64599&EventID=185
0,"During the COVID-19 pandemic, face-to-face academic research was suspended and
replaced by online research according to the social distancing measures. Conducting online
research has been underestimated in the past and at times chosen to facilitate either
discussion between participants in geographically disperse locations (Han et al., 2019) or
when focusing on individuals and groups who are members of online communities and
engage frequently in online activities such as distant learning, gaming, social media groups
(Steward & Shamdasani, 2017) etc. Although I acknowledge the limiting of potential
participants to those who have and can reliably use the requisite technologies (Guest et al.,
2013), most young people are competent and confident web users and as video conferencing
software improves the opportunity to conduct online focus groups steadily increases
(Rezabek, 2000).
Focus groups are used to explore attitudes, perceptions, feelings, and ideas about a specific
topic (Denscombe, 2010; Litoselliti, 2003) and seen as simulations of everyday discourses and
conversations or as a quasi-naturalistic method for studying the generation of social
representations or social knowledge in general (Lunt & Livingstone, 1996). In the COVID-19
context, conducting online focus groups fully replicate everyday conversations and social
interactions and offer more opportunities for dynamic discussions, active engagement, and
personal reflections while promoting participants’ emancipation and improving traditional
focus groups (Braun et al., 2017). In this article, I discuss the beneficial transformation of
online focus groups reflecting upon 20 online focus group discussions with young Europeans
regarding their attitudes towards Brexit and Europe.

0,"Traditionally, religion is thought of as an important determinant of voting behavior. The secularization of Western societies, however, has changed its role. Secularization not only limits the political relevance of religion, it likely affects the nature of religious cleavages too. Evidence from the United States suggests that a decrease of denominational differences goes hand in hand with increased relevance of religiosity. As a result, a divide between the secular sections of the society and a cross-denominational coalition of the most religious voters has emerged. In this paper, we examine whether such a change also occurs in Western Europe. Combining data from the European Social Survey (ESS) and information on parties’ positions from the Chapel Hill Expert Survey (CHES), we compare the explanatory power of different measures of religion in models of vote choice, with a focus on the contrast between religious denomination and religiosity. To gain insights on a likely transformation of the religious cleavage, from a cleavage based on denomination to one where religiosity polarizes citizens, we focus on changes in the role of religion for members of different birth cohorts.",Zeppelin University Friedrichshafen,,,,,,,,Zeppelin University Friedrichshafen,,Martin Elff,,,,,,,,Martin Elff,,Cleavages,Religion,Voting,,,,,,The Transformation of Religious Cleavages in Western Europe: A Comparative Analysis,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=66327&EventID=185

0,"This paper discusses how the emergence and assumption of the knowledge society as an ideological integration in the European Union (EU) and in the European Research Area (ERA) resulted in precarious and insecure employment relations in the Portuguese scientific system. The knowledge society narratives encouraged the European states to promote political initiatives to foster Innovation and Research (I&R) so that economic competitiveness would be improved. Consequently, and parallel to this scenario, since the beginning of the new millennium, the number of doctorates has been growing in Europe, without, however, a similar correspondence to the available positions in higher education institutions (HEI) and/or Research and Development Units (R&D), questioning not only the pertinence of training researchers, but also, and subsequently, the sustainability of the national innovation system (OECD 2019). These doctorates have been mainly integrated in the higher education system with short-term contracts to develop tasks within research projects. This association with research projects along with their precarious working conditions turned them into invisible workers inside Higher Education Institutions (HEI). Portugal was no exception in these tendencies with the number of PhD holders increasing since the new millennium, although still far from the average of the European countries. Based on the analysis of the Portuguese case, this study shows how the transformation of the higher education and the research systems induced a growing number of PhDs holders, which resulted in an increased unbalance of the labour market that, along with the projectification of science, has been leading to the worsening of the working conditions within academia. The increase in the invisible mass of short-term and/or part-time academics at the margins of the university expresses the Uberisation of academic work. A mixed-methods study is applied, combining the analysis of public data with intensive unstructured qualitative analysis (e.g. media press analysis). Findings show that the use of scholarships to finance scientific work generated a huge and growing bubble, subsequently intensifying the deterioration of researchers’ working conditions who were partially invisible in the system. This invisibility of Doctorates and their precarious working conditions corresponds to an Uberisation of scientific work, considering that the relationship maintained with the host institution was punctual/one-off and without any kind of involvement from HEI side. To a great extent, this invisibility and Uberisation of researchers’ work is a consequence of the higher education and scientific system’s governance model, since R&D units usually do not have their own staff, and research projects are hosted in these units and not in an HEI. Furthermore, it is also an outcome of the projectification of science, as the knowledge society is framed in the project format, resulting in the organisation of work in a fixed-term base (Ylijoki, 2016) and consequently in fixed-term contracts.",Universidade de Aveiro,Universidade de Aveiro,,,,,,,Universidade de Aveiro,,Teresa Carvalho,Sara Diogo,,,,,,,Sara Diogo,,Governance,Policy Analysis,Public Policy,Knowledge,Higher Education,Policy Implementation,,,The Uberisation of Scientific Work in Portugal,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64212&EventID=185
0,"The growing application of randomly-selected citizens assemblies to deliberate over responses to climate change is re-introducing an old idea to our democracies. They offer a glimpse of the potential of deliberative democracy theory, and the linked practise of deliberative mini-publics for better environmental governance, and supporting transformations to more sustainable societies. However, most sustainability scientists are not familiar with these concepts and methods, which have been growing in terms of their theoretical underpinnings, and through empirical experiments in the last few decades.
We review how deliberative democracy, and deliberative mini-publics specifically, can respond to the challenges presented by recent sustainability science literature. We emphasise how they depart from mainstream theory and practises of environmental governance and stakeholder participation, with an emphasis on their key characteristic of sortition. 
We identify three key potential contributions of deliberative democracy for environmental policy:
-	Enhancing the science-society relationship, addressing concerns of scientific trust and legitimacy, supporting an informed discussion with citizens and informing a broadly defined sustainability that is responsive to diverse societal concerns and more resilient.
-	A new way to break open polarized environmental conflicts and mediate wicked trade-offs where selected expert knowledge is weaponised to reinforce partisan positions.
-	A practical means to enhance the transformative capacity of societies, advancing ideals of a radical ecological democracy
We present a conceptual model that summarises the potential role of deliberative minipublics to positively affect the relationship between environmental policy, the public sphere, government and the potential for urgently needed transformations to more sustainable societies.
Contrary to critiques of democracy for being too slow or ineffective to tackle the environmental challenges of our age, we conclude that we urgently need more and deeper democracy to avert environmental crises, and that deliberative minipublics are a key process to achieve this.",Åbo Akademi,,,,,,,,Åbo Akademi,,Marina Lindell,,,,,,,,Marina Lindell,,Democracy,Environmental Policy,Political Participation,Climate Change,Public Opinion,,,,The un-realised potential of deliberative mini-publics for sustainability transformations,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63171&EventID=185

0,"The state-state of the heterogeneity of fiscal and tax autonomy across local authorities has attracted significant attention and higher self-financing power has been associated with both more articulate local politics, but also higher degrees of autonomy from central government handouts.  What is less explored are the implications of the one-size-fits-all country-level responses to shocks (i.e., Covid-19 related public safety measures) on the steady-state of the heterogeneity of fiscal and tax autonomy across types of local authorities (communes, towns, municipalities), and regions (counties, and development regions). The goal of this research is to explore the extent to which indiscriminate policy measures produce distributed fiscal/tax autonomy outcomes across types of local governments, and if yes, to evaluate the extent to which they are significant enough to produce a shift in the steady-state, or are only seasonal in nature. For this, we created a database of budget executions of the 3,227 Romanian local authorities, for the period 2017-2021. The level of fiscal and tax autonomy of each local government was calculated by averaging the corresponding total revenue/own revenue coefficients for the three fiscal years prior to COVID measures being adopted. Similarly, the fiscal/and tax autonomy coefficient for the COVID measure periods were estimated by averaging for each local government the total revenue/own revenue ratio for fiscal years 2020 and 2021. To estimate the non-linearity effects of macro-policy shock effects on local government fiscal/tax autonomy we applied non-parametric quantile regressions. We found the effect of one-size-fits-all country-level policy responses to be higher for local governments in the higher quantiles of the fiscal/tax autonomy scale. In conclusion, one-size-fits-all country-level policy responses can be associated with lower fiscal/tax autonomy in the highest deciles, which points to a lower overall local government fiscal/tax autonomy level in the country.",Babeş-Bolyai University,,,,,,,,Babeş-Bolyai University,,Daniel Pop,,,,,,,,Daniel Pop,,Governance,Local Government,Mixed Methods,,,,,,The uneven impact of macro-economic shocks on the heterogeneity of local government fiscal standings,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64131&EventID=185
0,"The Unique Normativity of Exclusion and Movement
Abstract
The presentation addresses the issue of political normativity from a unique perspective. It shows that exclusion is an essentially political conception which defines the political sphere. In my view, the political is the realm of the perpetual possibility of exclusion. It is led by the endless struggle for not be excluded at various levels of politics. The conceptual advantage of exclusion lies in its passive characteristic, in the sense that it does not require any actual claims to appear at the side of the excluded subjects. In this sense, the political is not necessarily intertwined with explicit claims of recognition or actual participation. It does not depend on someone’s actual will to be heard; rather, it can mean both the intentional and the unintentional exclusion of certain from the politics and the political community.
I argue that exclusion is a fundamental characteristic of the political realm because exclusion is (1) definitive, in the sense that it hinders any further possibilities for the excluded to get back into the game – or even be included in the first place. It is (2) propulsive, that is, it is a primary driving force for the political sphere. And it is (3) structural, in the sense that gender, race, sexual orientation, and intersections of these social characteristics can be underlying, yet implicit reasons for excluding someone from private circles and associations.
The next step of my argument builds on the relationship between exclusion and movement. The specialty of movement is located in its deep interconnectedness with the possibility of exclusion. In human history, movement and migration have always involved some kind of uncertainty in the sense of lack of voice or status, the obscurity of future prospects, and deficiencies in capabilities of self-organization and self-defense, among others. The reasons for these dispossessions are twofold: either the desire for settlement of some groups has been incompatible with the more mobile way of life of other groups, or political communities have been producing their subjects of excluded, forcing them to move. Therefore, while exclusion is a broad term for manifold social dynamics, movement is a concept that is inherently linked to the possibility of exclusion. Exclusion inherent in movement and migration corresponds to these characteristics of exclusion. Building on Thomas Nail’s (2015) unusual approach to migration, I argue that the exclusion inherent in movement and migration corresponds to the three conditions I depicted above. Therefore, I conclude, our focus should be directed from attempts to find solutions for once and for all to what is more important: it allows us to recognize different forms of exclusions and to address their underlying causes, motivations, operations, and roles in our social and political life.",Centre for Social Sciences,,,,,,,,Centre for Social Sciences,,Anna Ujlaki,,,,,,,,Anna Ujlaki,,Gender,Migration,Political Theory,Feminism,Race,,,,The Unique Normativity of Exclusion and Movement,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64038&EventID=185
0,"This study explores the use of president's executive power in policy shifts, considering the legislature as a significant constraint. President’s policy discretion was barely limited by the assembly’s check in the previous South Korean authoritarian regime, and “the legacy” has been considered to empower the president remained unchecked. The new Constitution paid less attention to the assembly’s control of presidents’ discretion in the policy-making and the system of South Korea was classified as “premier-presidential system” (Shugart and Carey 1992). South Korean presidents have been criticized to exert excessive power over legislation and to abuse the rule-making power or delegated decree power in pursuing their preferred policies. 
However, I argue that the growth of the congress’s ability to check the executive since the democratic transition has enforced presidents to consider the congress’s reactions against the president’s policy attempt. Presidential agendas have recorded low legislative success in the assembly and the evasion of legislative procedure was not always successful. In the changing political environment, presidents should choose to bargain with the legislature in order to get satisfying policy results. Using rational choice modelling and analytic narratives focusing on the majority party in Congress, the ruling party, and the legislative procedure, the analysis shows the range of presidential discretion when presidents in South Korea consider the effectiveness of assembly’s counteraction.

0,"Flannery O’Connor’s famous short novel is a ruthless confrontation with the root of violence. But beyond the usual contexts of literary criticism, a political theological reading is very much possible. Not simply because the prevention or abolition of violence is a (the?) basic legitimation demand, in Bernard Williams’ terms, but because it is often forgotten that the subject of the title – the ‘it’ – refers to the kingdom of God. It has been a matter of controversy how Jesus thought about this kingdom, or how his thinking developed, but on any interpretation, we must bear in mind, as it were, that what is being done, or born away, has a foundational importance for every form of human association, including the political community. The violent may be the powerful, the rich, the intelligent, but also the powerless, the poor, and the ignorant. The rather claustrophobic atmosphere of the novel helps us reduce our political imagination to the most basic relations: city versus nature, inclusion vs exclusion, intrusion vs secession, science vs ignorance, love vs hatred, childhood vs adulthood, evil vs good, violent death vs violent birth. The sheer amount of these contradictions, often buttressed by the similarly overwhelming metaphors (water vs fire, silence vs shrieks) is almost suffocating, but at the same time revealing. It tells us about our unquenchable metaphysical thirst, something that neither political moralism nor realism has been able to cope with. My purpose is to explore this dimension by help of O’Connor’s insights, supported by her essays on politics.",Corvinus University of Budapest,,,,,,,,Corvinus University of Budapest,,Zoltán BALÁZS,,,,,,,,Zoltán BALÁZS,,Political Theory,Political Violence,Analytic,,,,,,The Violent Bear It Away,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63693&EventID=185
0,"In a recent proposal, Bernard Manin (2017) has claimed that desirable public discourse should be about (adversarial) debate, not discussion. According to Manin, adversarial debating improves the quality of collective decisions, counteracts the fragmentation of the public sphere, facilitates the comprehension of choices, and treats the minority with respect. However, conceptualizing public discourse in terms of fully-fledged argumentative contestation is at odds with popular understandings of deliberation. Many contemporary deliberationists view deliberation as an “essentially cooperative venture” with the aim of finding common ground with others (Goodin 2018). Even John Dryzek, a pioneer expanded notions of deliberation, has declared (2009: 3): “Deliberation is different from adversarial debate. The initial aim is not to win, but to understand.” In this paper, I try to sort out how desirable public discourse should (and could) look like. I argue that while contestation is indeed an oddly under-appreciated element in deliberative theory, its virtuous effects are contingent as well as dependent on appropriate conceptualizations of contestation. I first argue that confusion about the proper role of contestatory vs collaborative modes has to do with insufficient conceptional work. Regarding constestation, I will distinguish between two conceptions, namely an oratorical and a deliberative one. The oratorical conception has “heresthetical” features and mainly aims at mobilizing (and “manipulating”) its audience; by contrast, the deliberative conception tries to marry the essential ingredients of adversarial debating – the intentional mobilization of controversy - with a (minimal) deliberative approach stressing both the production of robust reasons and (a modicum of) reflexivity and open-mindedness. Second, contra Manin, I suggest that contestation is no panacea for achieving desired democratic outcomes. Drawing from a “problem-based” understanding of “deliberation” (Warren 2017), I begin with various functions of public discourse and inquire what various forms of communication –with a key focus on contestatory and collaborative ones - can contribute to these functions. I distinguish between an epistemic function (the creation of “better knowledge”), an ethical function (the creation of common understanding, transformation towards common ground, and trust) and democratic functions (the production of accountability and consequentiality as well as the securing of inclusion, especially of marginalized voices) (see Mansbridge et al. 2012). I argue that contestatory practices have in-built mechanisms (exposure to maximum criticism) for unleashing some essential epistemic properties - in-depth thinking - as well as to enhance some democratic functions of public discourse (inclusion, accountability, and politicization). However, contestation in itself – also in its deliberative variant - may be a blunt and incomplete tool liable to misfire. Third, I will show that collaborative communication modes also possess mechanisms (“principle of charity”) to realize specific epistemic goals, namely broad thinking. Moreover, collaborative modes are in a better position to realize the ethical and some democratic aims of public discourse. Fourth, given the fact that no communicative practice is in a position to achieve the various functions of public discourse (epistemic, ethical and democratic) in totality, the various communication modes must be ´mixed´ and ´staged´.",Universität Stuttgart,,,,,,,,Universität Stuttgart,,André Bächtiger,,,,,,,,André Bächtiger,,Contentious Politics,Communication,Theoretical,,,,,,The Virtues and Vices of Contestation for Public Discourse,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64808&EventID=185
0,"The conceptualization of digital citizenship has advanced alongside the growth in accessibility and use of the internet, and interpretations of digital citizenship education have not been uniform. Originally understood from a competence-based perspective, digital citizenship typically now entails responsible, active and ethical engagement in digital spaces. Defining what it means to be a digital citizen has remained challenging, as digital interactions are not limited by geographic areas (with some notable exceptions. Despite this challenge, several conceptualizations of digital citizenship (and digital citizenship education) emphasize responsibilities associated with traditional understandings of citizenship, such as civic engagement. It is clear that digital citizenship is not a static concept, but one that develops alongside the opportunities and needs afforded by the internet. As such, the internet itself is undergoing a transition to Web3. Web3 refers to the use of decentralized technologies to enable active participation without large corporations, such as Facebook and Google. Largely building off of blockchain technology, Web3 promises a more transparent and fairer internet, built around collaboration and co-creation. Beginning with the premise that digital citizenship education must adapt alongside the internet, this paper uses qualitative content analysis to examine how Web3 is articulated in public discourse and identifies the main characteristics and technologies that distinguish it from previous versions of digitally-based interactions. The implications for Web3 Digital Citizenship Education that follow are not meant to supplant current understandings of Digital Citizenship, but rather serve as a supplement, including the skills and attitudes required for active participation, at both the local and global level.",Aalto University,,,,,,,,Aalto University,,Claire Shaw,,,,,,,,Claire Shaw,,Citizenship,Internet,Qualitative,Education,,,,,The Web3 Digital Citizenship: Implications of Web3 for digital citizenship education,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63877&EventID=185
0,"In a world where climate change became a central problem for policymakers to manage  - in different levels of governance (internationally, nationally and locally) - understanding how public policy instruments for ecological transitions and decarbonization are designed and chosen is of growing interest and have been explored in recent works. 
This paper therefore engages in this debate addressing the construction process of the ABC Plan, an official instrument of the Brazilian National Climate Change Policy for the decarbonization of the agricultural sector. To what extent can we observe a « climatization » of preexisting policy instruments in this process? We understang by « climatization » the action where actors present something (an issue, a solution; an instrument) that previously were not directly related to the climate problem through « climate terms ». 
An interesting element in this policy making process is that, even before the official publication of the Plan, the Ministry of Agriculture was already implementing an economic financing instrument called the ABC Program, which was incorporated into the agriculture credit instruments portfolio already in 2010/2011. As the official ABC Plan text was published in 2012 which made us question whether this policy brought something new or whether it was not a recycling of already existing devices, a reworking, perhaps an « climatization ». This study is based on the author's doctoral research using a qualitative methodology, including 30 semi-structured interviews with key informants (mostly identified on the Plan official document and snowball method) and the analysis of official documents as primary sources of data (primarily government texts such as decrees and laws). 
The argument developed is that the release of the Plan was possible on account of the formation and action of an epistemic community composed mainly by the experts of the Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation (Embrapa) who have been able to reformulate old solutions that were already well accepted by the actors of the sector and the government, reshaping them to fit the climate change terms.",Université Sorbonne Nouvelle,,,,,,,,Université Sorbonne Nouvelle,,Livia Kalil,,,,,,,,Livia Kalil,,Public Policy,Climate Change,National,Policy-Making,,,,,The « climatization » of a policy instrument : an analysis of the Brazilian Low Carbon Agriculture Plan (ABC),https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64244&EventID=185
0,"The political science literature continues to demonstrate the significance of the relationship between women’s increased political representation and various environmental outcomes. Yet, unanswered questions remain as to the contexts in which this relationship holds and the mechanisms through which it comes to be. To address this gap, I pay special attention to a characteristic of governance which is under-studied in the literature of women’s representation and climate change outcomes: corruption. A demonstrable scourge on environmental health, corruption has also been linked independently to women’s representation; a growing literature shows that increased women’s representation decreases corruption and that more women are elected in contexts of lower corruption. With this backing in the literature, I ask if women’s impact on environmental outcomes is moderated by states’ level of corruption. In so doing, I first offer theoretical backing for this relationship by drawing on the extant literature, arguing that environments of high corruption restrain, tokenize, and marginalize women representatives, thereby limiting the impact they may have on political outcomes. Conversely, in contexts of lower corruption, women’s unique preferences, which tend to be more environmental, left-leaning, and risk averse than men, are more likely to manifest in positive environmental outcomes. I empirically test the proposed relationship through time-series cross-sectional analyses of over 50 countries across 15 years, and find that in contexts of lower corruption, women’s representation is correlated with better environmental outputs and outcomes; in other words, both their political commitments to environmentalism and resulting environmental measures. These findings help broaden our understanding of the relationship between representation and environmental politics, and suggest that the interaction of both integrity and inclusivity in governments holds one potential key to fighting climate change.",University of Strathclyde,,,,,,,,University of Strathclyde,,Hannah Salamon,,,,,,,,Hannah Salamon,,Comparative Politics,Environmental Policy,Gender,Green Politics,Feminism,Quantitative,,,The ‘Women’s Representation-Corruption Link’ and Environmentalism: A Cross-National Study,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=62605&EventID=185
0,"A recent trend has seen various studies seek to interrogate the use and role of intuitions in political philosophy (see Floyd 2017) and political theory (see Rossi and Argenton 2021; Bosworth and Dowding 2019; Handby 2022). In this respect, Bosworth and Dowding show how ideology, sophistry, and assumptions can become embedded in terms throughout the history of ideas, thereby potentially biasing their use for contemporary purposes. In a broadly similar vein, Rossi and Argenton illustrate how an empirical and social/historical enquiry will reveal the fallacy of relying on certain intuitions for certain political arguments. Lastly, Handby draws on studies in cognitive psychology to show how intuitions can be biased by the city or country in which one lives, the institutions they live under, and their contingent life history of intuition holders. Each of these accounts seek to interrogate and examine the role of intuitions and, consequently, give us have serious reason to doubt the reliance of intuitions in contemporary normative political theorising. 

The purpose of this paper is to examine what comes next for political theory. If much of our contemporary theorising is premised on intuitions, can we continue to have faith in those arguments more broadly. To address this question, I set out four possible theories of critique targeted at political theory, and seek to assess whether the conclusions of Rossi and Argenton, Bosworth and Dowding, and Handby (among others), support those theories. The four theories I propose are: i) error theory, that arguments in political theory are false, given they are reliant on biased intuitions rather than ground truth, (ii) subjectivism, that arguments in political theory are for claims whose truth depend on the intuitions of the specific subject, (iii) relativism, that arguments in political theory are for claims whose truth depends on the intuitions of the arguer’s cultural group, and (iv) weak objectivism, that arguments in political theory are potentially biased by intuitions but can sometimes be corrected in ways so that they objectively track the ground truth.",Australian National University,,,,,,,,Australian National University,,Edmund Handby,,,,,,,,Edmund Handby,,Political Methodology,Political Theory,Knowledge,,,,,,Theorising Intuitions and Political Theory,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63124&EventID=185

Instead, they focus their energy on addressing the many forms of injustice that European colonialism has produced, and that Western imperialism keeps producing, as well as on possible ways of undoing these particular forms of injustice. Doing so, they at least implicitly make the point that producing justice theory may not be a suitable tool for this task. I will discuss two examples of post- and decolonial theory accounts of global injustice: work by Frantz Fanon and by Aníbal Quijano.

0,"There is a small but growing literature on the staffs of national parliaments outside of the U.S. Congress. These are mostly single country studies studying one type of staff (e.g. PPG, personal, institutional or committee staffs) or one role that staff can play. What the literature is currently missing is an integrated theoretical perspective on the role of staff that takes into account the diversity in the way that parliamentary staffs are organized in democratic countries.
This paper builds further on role theory in parliamentary studies to develop an integrated perspective that specifically address the place of staff in the democratic process. We recognize four types of staff that may be present to a greater or lesser extent in different parliaments, that have different principals (PPG staff, personal staff, institutional or committee staff). These different staffs can play different roles (advisor, scribe, advertiser, information broker, planner and compromise facilitator).
Our central expectation is that the reliance of type of staff over another in these different roles affects how democratic systems perform: a focus on committee and institutional staff leads to a focus on the impact of policies and with that output legitimacy. A focus on personal or PPG staff leads to a focus of the support of policies and with that input legitimacy.",Radboud Universiteit Nijmegen,"Departments of Political Science and Public Administration, Universiteit Leiden",,,,,,,Radboud Universiteit Nijmegen,,Gijs Jan Brandsma,Simon Otjes,,,,,,,Gijs Jan Brandsma,,Comparative Politics,Institutions,Parliaments,Public Administration,Knowledge,,,,Theorizing parliamentary staff,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63167&EventID=185
0,"Conflict is fundamental to an agonistic theorization of politics, although it must be delimited in a democracy, while also being preserved as a necessary moment for change (cf. Mouffe 2005). The conflictual view of politics, or, politics as dissociation (cf. Marchart 2018), ultimately belongs to the ontological domain of understanding, but as being ineliminable parts of real-life political experiences, and because of having a distortive potential, it is still necessary to conceive it in the context of democracy, which excludes radical negativity as real-life practice. 
The ancient political theory of stasis can provide support for this claim, since it rests on the premise that “war should stop at the gates of the city” (cf. Loraux 2002), thus, violent relations such as war and civil war form the frontier of politics, suggesting a literally agonistic view. This revolves around the practice of association, the idea (also) seen in Arendt that politics can be constructed primarily through speech and public discourse (Arendt 2005). However, in the stasis-literature one can find an argument seemingly contradicting this prescription of the polis. Solon, the arbitrator in a civil war, prescribed for his fellow citizens, that “…whoever when civil strife prevailed did not join forces with either party was to be disfranchised and not to be a member of the state.” (Aristotle, Const. Ath. 8.5.) However, this statement confuses the vision of an agonistic, let alone a consensual, democracy and seems to support a radically dissociative theory of politics. It is also worth addressing the foundational value of radical negativity in political ontology from this perspective.
The role and position of conflict in the associative theory of politics—or the political—can rest on this classical-based conceptualisation. The paper addresses the following problems: first, stasis as civil war can play a role in defining the polis, tor the political (this has the potential to underpin and deepen the Arendtian theorization of politics); second, stasis as civil war can illuminate the nature of over-polarization and disintegration, revealing the ambivalent political position and identity of citizens-of-civil-war; third, stasis can point to the urgent need to decide and re-establish the political community. This third aspect seems to be capable to show how the Solonian advice, as a non-depoliticizing action, can lead to a solution of stasis, to the over-politicisation of political affairs, and radical polarization. It could be argued that stasis in this case actually describes the urgency of decision, which is ultimately a decision that leads to the creation of a temporary and transitory political community—nonetheless, this kind of stasis as a decision does not solve all the problems that stasis as a disruptive set of events has caused in the polis.",Eötvös Loránd University,,,,,,,,Eötvös Loránd University,,Szilvia Horváth,,,,,,,,Szilvia Horváth,,Conflict,Democracy,Political Theory,,,,,,Thinking about conflict: Stasis and the re-foundation of politics,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64927&EventID=185
0,"Third-person effect about people’s ability to detect misleading information in the media has been largely studied in the last years. A large number of studies suggest a strong effect: most people tend to overestimate their own capacity to detect “fake news”, while underestimating the capacity of (close and distant) others in this direction. Explanations about this effect remain, though, largely speculative. Most significant predictors point towards news consumption patterns, social media dependency, confirmation bias, and perceived incidence of misleading information in the media. By means of a national survey (N=1000) conducted in Romania, the present study digs deeper into the explanations related to this particular type of third-person effect, by looking into the type of news consumers and the intensity of the third-person effect. Results show that significant predictors of this effect are critical thinking disposition, perceived exposure to fake news, and news consumption patterns (especially social media news consumption). When looking into news consumption patterns, there is a significant difference in the intensity of the effect between people who consume mostly mainstream media news (for which the effect is the strongest), news minimalists (who rarely consume news at all), social media news consumers, and hyper-media news consumers (for whom the effect is the weakest). However, perceived incidence of “fake news” does not differ much among the four types of news consumers. This provides new insights into how such biased perceptions are formed and the role the media play in this equation.",,National University of Political Studies and Public Administration,National University of Political Studies and Public Administration,,,,,,National University of Political Studies and Public Administration,,Madalina Botan,Raluca Buturoiu,Nicoleta Corbu,,,,,,Raluca Buturoiu,,Media,Quantitative,Social Media,Communication,Survey Research,,,,Third-person effect about people’s ability to detect misinformation and media diets: how news consumption patterns influence the intensity of the effect,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=62195&EventID=185
0,"There's a long tradition in political science to study citizens' trust towards the political system, such that political trust tends to be considered one of the main measures of a political system's health. Moreover, related to the study of the drivers behind European integration, this line of research demonstrated how the onset of the Great Recession undermined support towards its institutions (Ehrmann et al., 2013). The pandemic's exogeneity invites us to rethink the process of trust. Main aim of the proposed paper is to examine how has the outbreak of COVID-19 affected (or not) levels of trust towards the European Union.

We first approach this overarching objective of the paper by way of conceptual clarifications and operationalisation around the concept of political trust. Then, we consider the three main logics put forward to explain variation in trust towards the EU at the individual level (Harteveld et al., 2013). The first logic has to do with rational evaluations and the clarity of responsibility (strategic/rationalist approach). In turn, the second refers to identitarian concerns and feelings of relative attachment towards the national and European arenas (affective/psychological approach). Finally, the third logic centers on trust levels at the national arena and knowledge on EU matters, theorizing on the heuristic value of the former upon the latter (extrapolation approach). Building on current discussion of this literature (Brosius et al., 2019), we derive specific hypotheses regarding their interaction with the pandemic crisis and draw on recent cross-national Eurobarometer data to examine them empirically. We argue that exploiting the exogeneity of COVID-19 can shed new light on this old question and contribute to our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the trust generating process more broadly.",Aristotle University of Thessaloniki,Aristotle University of Thessaloniki,,,,,,,Aristotle University of Thessaloniki,,Eftychia Teperoglou,Alexandros Gotinakos,,,,,,,Alexandros Gotinakos,,Institutions,Identity,Euroscepticism,,,,,,This crisis hits differently?

0,"After two decades of low inflation in the eurozone, the Covid-19 crisis triggered inflation rates to rise well above the target of the European Central Bank (ECB). The inflationary pressures mark an important difference between the economic crisis related to Covid-19 and the eurozone crisis. In this article, we examine what the new inflationary pressures mean for the strategic environment of eurozone member states and their policy options in the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU). In particular, we ask how high inflationary pressures affect the policy options and EMU strategy of Germany as the eurozone’s most powerful surplus country. We argue that these developments put Germany in a trilemma between maintaining the status quo (austerity in ‘debtor states’), engaging in internal adjustment (revaluation at home), and committing to financing polices in the eurozone (redistribution from ‘creditor’ to ‘debtor states’). Each of the three policy options is associated with high political and economic costs for Germany. To understand how Germany can react to this trilemma, we analyze the extent to which German state elites have undergone a process of policy learning since the eurozone crisis, allowing for an incremental shift away from the status quo and towards internal adjustment and financing policies. In doing so, we design a fine-grained causal mechanism and test our expectations against evidence from original semi-structured interviews with German state elites and government representatives. As a result, we expect high inflationary pressures to cause a covert policy change towards internal adjustment and financing policies, e.g. in the form of an informal relaxation of the German debt brake, a consolidation of the Corona recovery fund, and a revision of the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP). Hence, by applying the concept of policy learning to current eurozone politics, the article offers new insights into EMU governance and the role of powerful states in the context of differentiated integration.",University of Vienna EIF,University of Vienna,,,,,,,University of Vienna,,Sebastian Heidebrecht,Magnus G.

0,"This paper argues that recent critiques (O´Flynn 2021; Scudder 2021) of ‘new wave’ conceptions of deliberation - especially ´expansive’ notions (Mansbridge et al. 2010) and ‘problem-based’ approaches (Warren 2017; Bächtiger and Parkinson 2019) - are not just ‘family quarrels’ but reflect deeper disagreements with broad ramifications for how we understand the ´workings´ of deliberation in politics and society, its antecedents and consequences. In order to better grapple with such disagreements, I articulate three stylized approaches to conceptualizing and understanding deliberation: a constitutive, a model-based and a problem-based approach. While the constitutive (or Habermasian) approach focuses on the constitutive dimensions of language and argument for producing mutual understanding as well as generating political legitimacy in modern, pluralistic societies marked by dissensus, the model-based approach seeks to realize (as well as institutionalize) deliberative ideals (and a “deliberative stance”) in the real world with direct effects, assuming that more deliberation will quasi-automatically strengthen democratic practice; the problem-based approach, in turn, understands deliberation as a contingent communicative practice that takes different forms according to different contexts and goals and that can improve - but also deteriorate - the workings of democratic systems. The boundaries among the three approaches are not always sharp and multiple areas of overlap and entanglements exist; nonetheless, the three approaches have different emphases and analytical foci. Distinguishing among them and understanding their internal precepts will help us better understand what deliberation is, what aims it serves and how it can – and should - function in a political system. Moreover, given the fact that all three approaches have distinct strengths and weaknesses, it makes sense to consider a unifying perspective. I propose that a generic problem-based perspective might provide a useful second-order framework (Mackie 1977; Saward 2021) from which the two other approaches can be put into new perspective. In so doing, we enter into a post-Habermasian era of deliberative thinking while still keeping some of its constituent parts.",Universität Stuttgart,,,,,,,,Universität Stuttgart,,André Bächtiger,,,,,,,,André Bächtiger,,Democracy,Institutions,Communication,Normative Theory,,,,,Three Approaches to Conceptualizing Deliberation,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64780&EventID=185
0,"The European Union is at the forefront of regulating artificial intelligence (AI), seeking to set the pace for global regulation. Its proposed AI Act suggests the first coercive rules for AI system providers and users, including outright bans of some applications and comparatively hefty penalties for non-compliance. Core to its regulatory strategy is a risk-based approach with proportional interventions that escalate with risk levels. While many AI regulation scholars and practitioners interpret risk-based regulation as rational problem-solving, regulation and governance studies have instead suggested a strong link to legitimacy and reputation management. This article investigates how and why the EU seeks legitimacy and reputation through risk-based AI regulation. Drawing on a cultural political economy framework, combined with a critical-interpretivist analysis of primary documents and semi-structured expert interviews, I suggest that the risk heuristic enables the EU to carve out three much diverse worlds of AI risk regulation: the innovation-enabling world of low-risk AI systems, the risk-mitigating world of high-risk AI systems, and the strict watchdog world of unacceptable AI applications. This risk-based regulatory differentiation allows the EU not only to commit itself to competing policy goals and to mobilize different legitimatory logics at once; it is also a crucial branding device in Brussels’ efforts to compete globally on “trustworthy” AI.",Universitetet i Bergen,,,,,,,,Universitetet i Bergen,,Regine Paul,,,,,,,,Regine Paul,,European Union,Political Economy,Regulation,Technology,,,,,Three worlds of risk regulation: the cultural political economy of governing artificial intelligence in Europe,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63944&EventID=185
0,"Many citizens feel excluded from political decision-making, which in their eyes is dominated by an unresponsive political elite. Citizens with high populist attitudes yearn for more popular control and for ‘the people’ to be included in the political process. Democratic scholars have posed that innovative processes that include and empower citizens can curb such populist sentiments. Participatory budgeting events (PBs) should be particularly suited to address populist demands due to the fact that they are focused on giving citizens actual influence on policy-making. Several studies have looked at the effect of participation in a democratic innovation on political attitudes such as democratic satisfaction, trust in parliament, and external political efficacy. However, so far no study has examined the effect of participation in a democratic innovation on populist attitudes. 
This study will fill that gap. It empirically assesses if and to what extent participation in a PB has an effect on populist attitudes, and whether citizens with high populist attitudes are affected differently than citizens with low populist attitudes. In doing so, we test the claims of democratic scholars regarding the potential of democratic innovations to decrease populist sentiments, as well as contribute to the existing empirical knowledge regarding the effects of participation in democratic innovations on citizens‘ political attitudes. For our analysis we use survey data on participants to four local PB events in the Netherlands before and after participation. We conduct a statistical analysis to estimate the extent and direction of the effect of participation in a PB event on citizens’ populist attitudes.",Radboud Universiteit Nijmegen,,,,,,,,Radboud Universiteit Nijmegen,,Marie-Isabel Theuwis,,,,,,,,Marie-Isabel Theuwis,,Democracy,Political Participation,Populism,Public Opinion,,,,,Through the Looking Glass: The Effect of Participation in a Participatory Budget on Citizens’ Populist Attitudes,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64716&EventID=185
0,"Despite high employment aspirations, refugee women in Austria are not well integrated into the labour market. They lag behind their male counterparts as well as the female population in general (source). Integration measures play an important role in overcoming structural and individual challenges, however, they need to be tailored to the specific needs of refugee women.
Based on the signalling theory of Spence (1973) and the theory of social choice of Arrows (1971), this paper argues that labour markets are embedded in institutional frameworks of host societies. Accordingly, local employers – particularly SMEs - tend to prefer signals such as educational certificates from local institutions and job experience in companies in the region to foreign credentials and employment experience abroad. The paper discusses whether it is more favourable for refugee women to obtain training or on the on-the-job experience with a local institution rather than undergoing the lengthy procedure of recognizing previous education, and discusses the consequences of this reasoning on labour market integration policies.
The argument is empirically substantiated by qualitative data retrieved from 22 in-depth interviews with refugee women from Afghanistan, Chechnya, Iraq, Somalia and Syria. In addition, 32 expert interviews were conducted with representatives of integration projects, public administrations and labour market agencies in Austria, Germany and Norway. These interviews were conducted in the framework of the FARIM project (funded by AMIF and the Austrian Federal Chancellery). A thematic analysis of the primary data shows a range of gender-specific challenges that refugee women face and provides insights into labour market specific integration measures from the countries under study.

0,"To be a junior minister: How junior ministers supervise their coalition partners 
There are two motivations for appointing junior ministers in coalition governments. One is to solve distributional conflicts among coalition partners because junior ministers’ posts are additional payoff allocated to the coalition partners. The other one sees junior ministers as an oversight mechanism to monitor the ministers and their policymaking activities (Lipsmeyer and Pierce 2011; Manow and Zorn 2004). The oversight takes place especially in those fields which are important to the party (Greene and Jensen 2016). 
Research on junior ministers as an oversight mechanism focused on who is more likely to be shadowed in terms of the party size, its position in the coalition, ideological distance from the center as well as the ministry in question; the relative saliency of the ministry in general and to specific parties in particular (Lipsmeyer and Pierce 2011; Thies 2001). The tacit assumption of this research is that once a rival junior minister is assigned, monitoring will take place. Research so far did not examine the actual activities of the junior ministers. Specifically, to what extent and under which conditions can they monitor the ministers? 
This paper aims at opening the black box of the activities of rival junior ministers. It examines junior ministers in Israel. The data includes information on all rival junior ministers from 1981 until 2020, interviews with former junior ministers, publicly available calendars of junior ministers and reports provided by junior ministers in the parliamentary committees. 
Preliminary findings suggest two types of rival junior ministers: junior ministers from the formateur party who do not receive a specific jurisdiction in the ministry and junior ministers from non-formateur parties who receive a specific jurisdiction in the ministry, in most cases a jurisdiction the party cares most about. The latter focuses more on limiting the minister’s autonomy in the specific jurisdiction they are in charge of. This suggests that for non-formateur parties, assigning rival junior ministers might be an even more powerful tool than expected. The junior ministers narrow the informational gap and receive agenda-setting power over jurisdictions within the ministry. If this is true, it has implications for understanding delegation costs in coalition governments. This is because it suggests that coalition partners should monitor the ministers and the junior ministers.",Bar Ilan University,,,,,,,,Bar Ilan University,,Ilana Shpaizman,,,,,,,,Ilana Shpaizman,,Elites,Executives,Government,Coalition,,,,,To be a junior minister: How junior ministers supervise their coalition partners,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63631&EventID=185
0,"Empirical evidence of the dynamics of institutional representation of legislatures suggests an increase in public engagement activities, with unelected officials taking the lead. Different from elected legislators, legislative staff and aides are increasingly occupying spaces in the legislature’s public interface. This scenario is largely in contrast with the chaotic public perceptions of the institutions, and the sometimes-divisive politics that characterise them. As research exploring this subject is still limited, gaps remain in understanding how it manifests across different contexts. This is especially so in developing democracies where the study of legislative processes and development have been overwhelmingly about legislators, with little research on the frameworks and practices that shape legislative public engagement (LPE). Against this background, this paper draws on months of fieldwork in Nigeria’s largest legislative institution, the federal House of Representatives, and the influential Lagos State House of Assembly, to explore the roles of officials in developing and implementing public engagement initiatives. How do officials fit into LPE in the spaces of Africa’s presidential democracies often impacted by low institutional capacity and high legislator turnover? How does LPE with external stakeholders, in turn, influence the positioning and agency of officials in the processes and workings of legislatures? This paper will therefore contribute towards a better understanding of the role of officials in the development of LPE processes and the ensuing institution-public interface, whilst accounting for national-subnational variations in institutional representation.",University of Leeds,,,,,,,,University of Leeds,,Temitayo Odeyemi,,,,,,,,Temitayo Odeyemi,,Democracy,Institutions,Parliaments,Representation,Developing World Politics,Domestic Politics,Political Engagement,,"To be seen, or heard, but not both: the role of support services in implementing legislative public engagement in Nigeria",https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65040&EventID=185
0,"Over the past two decades, radical groups on the right of the political spectrum have become more prominent in liberal democracies. Although often described as “the multiculturalist unicorn”, Canada is no exception to this dynamic. Various radical right groups have recently emerged, and their actions have gained visibility. How can we make sense of individuals’ motivations to join these groups? Drawing on semi-structured interviews with formal members and sympathizers of the radical right group La Meute (in English, The Wolfpack), this study investigates a classical question in the field of social movements studies: what does it take for individuals to move “from the balcony to the barricades”? More specifically, it explores why some individuals join radical right groups, while others – despite sharing similar concerns over immigration-related issues – do not. The analysis highlights that, while both members and sympathizers of La Meute adhere to the perceived problems (e.g., immigration, multiculturalism) and proposed solutions (e.g., restricting immigration, assimilation) put forward by the group, only members of La Meute identify with the group’s collective identity. Sympathizers of La Meute, for their part, perceive that the group’s identity and protest actions do not reflect who they are, what they believe and what they are comfortable with. Moreover, in their eyes, the problems and solutions identified by La Meute do not outweigh the potential costs of joining the group: these individuals fear being judged and stigmatized because of the group’s negative reputation.",Universitetet i Oslo,,,,,,,,Universitetet i Oslo,,Audrey Gagnon,,,,,,,,Audrey Gagnon,,Contentious Politics,Extremism,Social Movements,Activism,,,,,To join or not to join: An analysis of individuals’ motivations for joining (or not) radical right groups,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63180&EventID=185

Particularly the focus on the protection of civilians (POC) has experienced an upsurge after 1999 and has been accompanied by major reforms in the organization's legislation, such as the Brahimi Report or the Capstone Doctrine. This article analyzes the impact of these POC regula-tions, together with exogenous shocks, on the United Nations’ language and contributes to on-going debates about the organization’s normative clustering of war. Relying on insight from Framing Theory, a corpus of 1,802 Security Council and General Assembly resolutions between 1990 and 2019 was analyzed through the Structural Topic Model (STM) algorithm. Two major conclusions are drawn. First, the UN relies on two rhetorical clusters (ground deployment vs. political/legal response) to operationally frame its conflict resolution efforts. Although blurred to some extent, these have evolved in an opposing fashion over time and complementary shifts in their relative prominence reflect key moments of institutional restructuring. Importantly, three temporal breakpoints (years 2001, 2005 and 2009) in terms of deviating intensity of POC language were identified. Second, evidence of an existing geographical bias materialized, as the organization appears to linguistically characterize conflicts based on their geographical location, but not engage in a ""topic spill-over"" across borders.

0,"As part of the European Green Deal, the New Circular Economy Action Plan encourages circular approaches to water reuse in agriculture, promotes more sustainable application of nutrients and the stimulation of markets for recovered nutrients. Innovative nutrient recovery technologies pave the way for visions of circular and high-tech agricultural systems that enable the reuse of nutrients in food production. At the same time, nutrient recovery technologies raise new cross-sectoral policy issues and challenge existing agri-food policy frameworks (Schwindenhammer/Gonglach 2021). The paper discusses the impact of an emerging technological approach to nutrient recovery from wastewater in Germany on the politicization of fertilizer regulation. The technological approach envisions the connection of the wastewater treatment system and the agricultural production system. It projects the transformation of a conventional sewage treatment plant into a ‘NEWtrient®-Center’, which draws the essential resources for urban hydroponic plant cultivation from municipal wastewater. Building on research of agri-food technology innovation, agri-food issue politicization (Feindt et al. 2021) and standardization in agri-food policy (Schwindenhammer 2017), we conceptualize nutrient recovery technology as a potential driver of politicization of fertilizer regulation. Building on qualitative research (document analysis and interviews), the paper shows that nutrient recovery technology fuels new policy debates on the scope of fertilizer regulation, approaches to quality assessment and related indicators and limit values for contaminants. As yet, existing component material categories (CMCs) defined in EU Fertilizing Products Regulation (FPR) (EU) 2019/1009, determining which materials EU fertilizer products may exclusively consist of, do not cover wastewater as a resource. Pointing to the opportunities provided by wastewater nutrient recovery technologies, different policy actors criticize regulatory gaps in fertilizer regulation and demand extension of the list of CMCs by wastewater to ensure more extensive reuse of nutrients in fertilizer production and related market developments. Critics stress risks related to contaminants of emerging concern, such as pharmaceuticals, pesticides, or biocides and question the potential of nutrient recovery from wastewater for reuse as fertilizer in agriculture.

0,"Recent research on decision-making around energy infrastructure projects has focused on issues of procedural justice, including rising concern about the degree to which communities near proposed shale gas sites have been able to influence decision-making. We draw on mixed methods research focused on two UK case study communities (Great Altcar, Lancashire and Woodsetts, Yorkshire) to critically evaluate community consultation prior to the submission of planning applications for exploratory drilling. 

We ask: 
(1) How, when and why do shale operators engage with local communities? 
(2) What are local community perceptions and responses to those engagement activities? 
(3) What are the implications for a just energy transition? 

To answer these questions, we draw on qualitative (interviews, participant observation, documentary analysis) and quantitative (survey of local residents) data. We find a significant gap between operator claims of early and transparent consultation, as stated in Statements of Community Involvement, and engagement outcomes. Further, engagement efforts in both communities were perceived by local residents as insufficient, ineffective and insincere. In neither case did consultation lead to significant change to planning applications. 

We conclude that operator consultation with shale gas host communities was tokenistic, lacked procedural justice, and partly contributed to ‘shale fail’ in the UK. Given that shale operators are also engaged in net zero underground projects (e.g. geothermal energy, thermal storage), these findings have important lessons for the credibility of land-use planning, a just energy transition and the achievement of net zero policy targets.",University of Exeter,University of Stirling,University of Exeter,,,,,,University of Exeter,,Patrick Devine-Wright,Jennifer Dickie,Stacia Ryder,,,,,,Patrick Devine-Wright,,,,,,,,,,Tokenism or Empowerment?: Evaluating operator consultation with communities hosting proposed shale gas exploration,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=66216&EventID=185
0,"Local daily newspapers are rarely in the focus of research on the European public. However, because of their important functions at the local level, they are not to be neglected and can contribute to the politicization of the EU by acting as a hinge between the actors from politics, the mass media and civil society, their strategies and activities as well as the reporting in the medium itself. In order to take a closer look at this, the dissertation analyzes how politicians (Members of the European Parliament, MEP), as top-down actors, and civil actors, as bottom-up actors, affect local journalists and their EU
reporting in local newspapers. The research questions are: How do local newspapers design the top- down and bottom-up dynamics of the formation of a European public? How do MEPs (top-down) affect the local newspapers and how is this represented by journalists? How do the population and civil society actors (bottom-up) affect the local newspapers and how is this taken up and illustrated by local journalists?

0,"In the wake of developments such as evidence-based policy-making, performance management, and big data, decision-makers possess historically unrivalled information on societal issues, their origins, and potential solutions (Van Dooren & Van De Walle, 2016). Paradoxically, this abundance of information leads to an ever-increasing scarcity of attention, as the available information greatly exceeds decision-makers’ information-processing capacities (Simon, 1971). 

Attention is the sine qua non of policy-making: What is attended to can be addressed in policy responses; what is overlooked or goes unnoticed cannot. Amidst an affluence of societal issues and an abundance of information, political processes are increasingly unsuccessful in providing the administrative apparatus with an attainable agenda of clear and consistent policy objectives. As a consequence of such “political failure” (Meier et al., 2019), top-level bureaucrats must increasingly navigate both administrative functions of implementation, as well as political functions of issue prioritization.

Building on these observations, this article seeks to extend behavioural theory (cf. Cyert and March, 1992) by examining how top-level bureaucrats prioritize societal issues amidst political failure. For this purpose, this article further develops Andersen et al.’s (2016) typology of public performance characteristics. The framework outlines several issue characteristics that may underlie prioritization, including stakeholders (e.g. is the issue articulated by for instance politicians, citizens, or professionals?), formality (e.g. is a performance target for the issue formally defined?), subjectivity (e.g. is the issue expressed in objective or subjective indicators?), and unit of analysis (e.g. does the issue concern the organization, a policy program, or an individual?), and type of indicator (e.g. is the issue expressed as quantitative or qualitative information?). Utilizing a sample of top-level bureaucrats in Dutch local administrations,  we examine issue prioritization through a discrete choice experiment in which participants prioritize issues that vary on the above-mentioned characteristics. 

This article aims at developing a theory of bureaucratic issue prioritization amidst political failure and provides a framework of issue characteristics that explains which societal issues are most likely to be prioritized by top-level bureaucrats in the absence of clear and consistent political objectives.

0,"The geopolitics of energy transition has been the focus of a growing body of research (cf. IRENA 2019, van der Graaf et al 2020, Blondeel et al 2021, etc), yet the concept remains undertheorized, and the boundaries between geopolitics and geoeconomics are often blurry. In addition, many such geopolitical analyses tend to focus on how a future net zero world would be different from the world today (e.g. in redrawing the geopolitical map or in the expected diminished potential for cross-border conflicts over energy); fewer are explicitly concerned with the highly contested, multi-speed transitions unfolding at present, where the future of fossil fuels is still not fully decided (but see Goldthau and Westphal 2019 for a different take). While the geopolitics of fossil fuels emphasizes securing access to oil and gas resources, controlling energy transportation corridors, and the relative power of energy producers versus consumers, in a decarbonizing global economy, the issues of technology leadership, actively shaping value chains for clean technologies, and the rising power of energy consumers are becoming more prominent. 
 
This paper will attempt to disentangle the concepts of geoeconomics and geopolitics and develop an analytical framework of the geoeconomics of the low-carbon transition, understood as managing strategic dependencies (and especially asymmetric dependencies) across three key dimensions: resources, physical infrastructure, and technology & data. In addition, the paper will consider three main channels of intervention that governments use in managing dependencies in the area of energy transition: these include markets, finance, and institutions/rules of interaction (e.g. policies, regulations, and standards). Following calls by geoeconomics scholars (e.g. Kim 2021) to better conceptualize the role of non-state actors, our framework will seek to integrate the activities of different types of actors in the low-carbon transition. In doing so, we will draw on theoretical insights from the literature on global production networks (GPNs), which has developed an apparatus for analyzing the various roles of both lead firms and states across GPNs (e.g. Horner 2016). Finally, the paper will discuss potential contradictions and trade-offs inherent in the ongoing low-carbon transition. These can stem from the occasionally conflicting logics of geopolitics and geoeconomics, or be rooted in the simultaneous need to achieve geo-economic leadership through competition, on the one hand, and the need for cooperation on climate as a collective action dilemma, on the other.",Institute for Advanced Sustainability Studies (IASS),Institute for Advanced Sustainability Studies (IASS),,,,,,,Institute for Advanced Sustainability Studies (IASS),,Rainer Quitzow,Yana Zabanova,,,,,,,Yana Zabanova,,Public Policy,Climate Change,Technology,Energy,Energy Policy,,,,Towards a geoeconomics of the low-carbon transition,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64257&EventID=185
0,"Gig-workers are described as a new labor category, which is experiencing new forms and levels of precarity and insecurity. The extent to which national welfare schemes cover them depends on contextual features, such as local labor market regulations and rules for benefit entitlement, but it is rare that they are covered by collective bargaining, employment protection rights, and the national insurance system. This lack of social protection is combined with high labor market insecurities, as gig work tends to be vulnerable, both to demand volatility and changes in the business goals of the platforms. 
As gig-work platforms are becoming a growing part of the economy, the question of the political consequences of this form of labor market insecurity is becoming pressing. The combination of labor market risks and limited access to social insurance will mean that gig workers are likely to differ in their welfare preferences from other labor groups, putting new pressures on the welfare state. This paper thus focuses on empirically examining the welfare preference of gig workers.
The analyses show that gig-workers feel more insecure regarding long-term and short-term risks. Nonetheless, the welfare preference of gig workers is mediated by their education. While non-educated gig workers support an expansion of welfare state provisions, educated gig workers prefer less welfare state provision than traditional educated workers.",Université de Lausanne,,,,,,,,Université de Lausanne,,Juliana Chueri,,,,,,,,Juliana Chueri,,Social Welfare,Welfare State,Technology,,,,,,Towards a great gig transformation?

0,"Security has become a recurring theme when addressing minority issues. Though minorities are often perceived as raising security concerns, the fundamental task is to ask ‘security for whom?’ and reflect on what in society really needs to be secured. Addressing this question, this contribution analyzes minority issues in terms of ‘human security’.  

Human security regards the need to guarantee the well-being of individuals, providing ‘freedom from fear,’ ‘freedom from want’ and ‘human dignity.’ I argue that a human security approach provides several insights to better deal with minority concerns, adding to the traditional goal of recognizing civil, political and cultural rights, a more comprehensive, holistic understanding of the needs and challenges faced by members of minorities. However, human security is a vague term that is not clearly operationalized. In this light, this contribution aims at discussing the implications of addressing minority protection from a human security perspective as well as developing an innovative human security index that applies specifically to cultural diversity issues and allows to measure the degree of human security provided to minorities.",European Academy of Bolzano,,,,,,,,European Academy of Bolzano,,Andrea Carlà,,,,,,,,Andrea Carlà,,Ethnic Conflict,Human Rights,International Relations,Security,Race,,,,Towards a Human Security Index for minorities: pursuing enriched minority protection,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63077&EventID=185
0,"The paper moves beyond static conceptions to investigate citizenship within the performative turn. By seeing citizenship as enactment in produced spaces (spatialities) (Lefebvre 2009), in the context of Bourdieusian asymmetrical fields (Bourdieu 1979; 1984; 1998; 1990; 1991) the paper offers new ways to explore the constitutive phenomenon of citizenship and alterities in a social field.

The paper argues that such a conception opens up the space in which ‘emergent subject positions’ in an asymmetrical field can be conceptualized and investigated - in dialectical relations to material(s), structures, each other. As well as in relational discourses that prevail in an analytical ‘space/field’. Furthermore, the paper demonstrates how the study of citizenship requires engaging with the political ‘boundaries’ of the analytical field. In this light the paper calls for a critical orientation towards the ontological and analytical constitution of the field of citizenship (in enactment politics).

Taken together, the paper forwards two key insights in conceptualizing citizenship as enactment in spatiality; firstly a centralization of dialectics in underscoring the constitutive phenomena of citizenship. Secondly, a critical approach to studying and investigating citizenship.

0,"Following the international trend of the proliferation of regulatory agencies as a central part of modern governance systems, this paper studies the evolution of public sector and the gradual formation of the Iranian regulatory landscape, its main stages, its institutional arrangement, the challenges it has been facing, and the extent that it has improved the performance of the governance system as a whole. 

As such, the paper explores the period when the main regulatory functions were mainly performed centrally by the ministerial departments, towards a time when several semi-independent regulatory bodies were gradually established in the late 1990s. It then discusses the post-privatization era following the amendment of Article 44 of the Constitution in 2005, characterized by a huge wave of the privatization of state-owned enterprises and a plethora of national acts passed by the Parliament officially proposing the establishment of the National Competition Council and sectoral regulatory authorities. Finally, the paper reviews the recent institutional developments derived from either the emergence of disruptive, mainly digital, technologies or the new legal frameworks facilitating regulatory cooperations and convergence arrangements.

Building upon such a contextual analysis, the paper shows that the Iranian regulatory governance has witnessed the rise of a new generation of agencies with expanded competencies in protecting a wide range of socio-political, technical as well as economic public interests.

0,"Complex transboundary policy issues such as climate change among other environmental challenges have emphasized the central role of public international organizations  in the policymaking process. There, organizational learning has been long recognized as a key mechanism for informing policy positions (e.g., Gerlak et al., 2018; Gerlak, Heikkila, & Newig, 2020). However, relatively little is known about how such organizations engage in policy learning. Even less is known at the inter-organizational supranational levels. 
Literature on organizational learning has hitherto mostly focused on how organizations develop their internal structures and capacities to solve problems, improve performance or adapt to external perturbations in their environments (e.g., Koch & Lindenthal, 2011; Zito, 2009). Network learning literature on the other hand has focused more on larger learning interactions among heterogenous units of analysis, spanning individual, collective, public, and private actors (e.g., Ingrams, 2017), and still calls for more granular understandings of inter-organizational learning (e.g., Moynihan, 2008). In this article, using a grounded theory approach, we leverage the case of the development of the European Green Deal (as a policy framework addressing the complex issue of climate change) to explore how inter-organizational policy learning takes place around complex transboundary policy issues.
Here, we focus on the intervening inter-organizational policy learning processes between supranational organizations, chiefly: the European Commission and the European Environmental Agency. While these organizations have different mandates – the European Commission is in charge of proposing legislation in the European Union, among other responsibilities; and the European Environment Agency is mandated to monitor, assess and provide knowledge on the state of the environment and environmental policy in Europe – they interact very closely in the climate and environmental domains. In this article, we aim to untangle the learning relationship between these two in this specific case, on the basis of an extensive literature review, document analysis and in-depth semi-structured interviews.
We construct an analytical framework that accounts for key policy learning interactions between internal and external organizational structures, policy actors (individual and collective), policymaking contexts, and policy issue formulation at the micro-meso and macro levels (Zaki, Wayenberg, and George, forthcoming). We leverage this analysis to propose a grounded theoretical framework for inter-organizational policy learning and explore the causal relationship between policy learning and changes in policy positions. In doing so, we account for the different structural and contextual configurations that potentially catalyze or inhibit inter-organizational learning within the domain of environmental governance.We also leverage our findings to offer insights to practitioners on how to enhance the design of inter-organizational policy learning frameworks.",Ghent University,Ghent University,,,,,,,Ghent University,,Bishoy Zaki,Claire Dupont,,,,,,,Bishoy Zaki,,European Politics,Governance,Public Policy,,,,,,Towards a theoretical framework of inter-organizational policy learning: A case of the European Green Deal,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64286&EventID=185
0,"Liberal democracy promises to cure the perils of earlier forms of democracies – namely the “tyranny of the majority” – by institutionalized minority rights and by the principle of democratic fallibilism, the institutionalized revisability of political action. However, because democracies are dependent on prerequisites they cannot guarantee qua existence, both principles are required to be internalized by its bearers: Political actors need to practice liberal agnosticism. To prevent tyrannic behavior, they must refrain from transcending and enforcing their preferences without regard to and on the cost of other actors. In mature liberal-representative democracies, liberal agnosticism - although it includes a self-limitation in preference enforcement – seems to be internalized by the majority of political actors acting within the democratic regime of institutions, values and norms. However, the internalization of those democratic principles both, in action and ideology, does not seem to hold for modern radical right parties – political actors that are often disadvantaged in party competition. From an ideological perspective, modern radical right parties are still substantially radical despite a superficial discursive normalization. How this contradiction plays out in rhetoric action in relation to the principles of democratic fallibilism, protection of minority rights and its internalization in liberal agnosticism is subject of our interest. By analysing all parliamentary speeches and posts on the official Facebook pages from 2017 to 2019 with computer-assisted qualitative discourse analysis (CAQDA), we show how the French Rassemblement National (RN) and the German Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) bridge the superficial conflict between substantial radicalism and discursive normalization by creating inversion narratives and victimisation narratives embedded in a consistent populist antagonization between a sociocultural homogenous in-group solely represented and protected by the radical right party against a ""betraying"" political elite on vertical level and ""threatening"" sociocultural outsiders on horizontal level. It becomes evident that the superficial discursive normalization is not the effect of a substantial moderation but rather an instrumental discursive act against core pillars of liberal-representative democracy embedded in a still substantial radicality: Starting from the inverting, blurring, victimizing, and antagonizing populist rhetoric that disregards liberal agnosticism, both parties undermine the institutionalized protection of minorities by emphasizing conspiracy and threat scenarios and they undermine institutionalized democratic fallibilism by constructing democratic deficits. Broadening the scope, we develop that radical right parties exemplify tyrannic behavior which in liberal-representative democracy is more likely to be exercised by political minorities rather than by a majority: The tyranny of the minority captures the phenomenon that disadvantaged political actors try to compensate for their political powerlessness by exaggerating their own preferences to withdraw them from political contestation disregarding the self-limiting liberal agnosticism practiced by all other actors. Radical right parties exercise a specific radical tyranny of the minority as they also undermine the principles of protection of minority rights and of democratic fallibilism.",Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München – LMU,Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München – LMU,,,,,,,Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München – LMU,,Jan Biehler,Karsten Fischer,,,,,,,Karsten Fischer,,Democracy,Extremism,Political Competition,Political Parties,Political Theory,Populism,Qualitative Comparative Analysis,Narratives,Towards a Tyranny of the Minority: Discursive Freeriding of AfD and RN Against Liberal Agnosticism,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64461&EventID=185
0,"How can one of the world’s largest multi-lateral banks be moved by seemingly small actors, such as civil society organisations (CSOs) to exclude from its lending portfolio one of the most powerful industries in the global economy? This case study analyses the ‘Fossil Free EIB’ campaign by a transnational civil society coalition in Europe urging the European Investment Bank, the lending arm of the European Union, to discontinue its financial support of fossil fuel projects, such as gas pipelines. The proposal hence is relevant to the section’s themes of energy politics (actors, interests, institutions) and fossil fuels phase-out.
The case is an example of how civil society organisations with very different sets of skills, expertise but also underlying theories of change were able to combine into a strategic hybrid model of so-called inside lobbying (including expert talks, briefings, reports and so on) and an outside approach (including public actions, online petitions and social media campaigns). The case is made that while different forms of collective action are required to achieve change, each approach may yield different types of results. The discussion of findings explains why lobbying efforts may not be sufficient to leverage structural changes, as classical policy advocacy methods do not address power relations that underlie processes of policy formulation and implementation.
Yet, achieving long-term structural changes, such as an economy that is not based on fossil fuels, requires shifting underlying power relations. To tackle power dynamics between social actors, such as movements, governments and the fossil fuel industry, requires an adequate and actionable concept of power. A conceptual tool is proposed to capture and assess power dynamics between the stakeholders. While raising political salience is an important task, achieving their goals requires movements to do much more than only mobilising the public. Successful movements often base their strategies on diligent power analyses sufficiently detailed to inform more nuanced, targeted tactics, such as winning over support from specific groups, shifting loyalties, particularly to create defections in the ranks of the adversary.
The presented findings are part of a broader qualitative explorative study on the strategic repertoire of movements and its effect on the scope of movement outcomes. Data is collected and analysed from semi-structured interviews with the relevant stakeholders in the dynamics, as well as existing case documentation by the various involved organisations, as well as newspaper coverage and literature on the global fossil fuel divestment movement, which is part of the climate justice movement.",University of Wollongong,,,,,,,,University of Wollongong,,Dalilah Shemia-Goeke,,,,,,,,Dalilah Shemia-Goeke,,Civil Society,European Union,Climate Change,Activism,,,,,Towards Fossil Free Lending in the European Union?,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63699&EventID=185

These attributes include for example, sufficient degrees of freedom, coherence, consistency, robustness, resilience among others. There is however lack of clarity on specific causal mechanisms through which these impact the effectiveness of policy mixes.

0,"This article examines whether trade imbalances undermine the economic foundation of the world politics. From a positive perspective, trade deficits can be used as economic leverages to finance. This article probes into the question whether the negative effects of global trade imbalances finally spill into high politics. I argue that trade deficits can not only put states under pressure to adjust the balance, but also create dependence and increase the vulnerability of states. Frictions accumulate in the adjustment of dyadic imbalanced trade, creating the potential for future conflict among states. The coordination of the state preferences and domestic preferences contributes to more aggressive foreign policies. Using temporal exponential graph models to analyze the network of military interstate disputes across monadic, dyadic and network levels over the years during 1951-1999, strong support is found for those arguments. The results show that greater global trade deficits of a state, greater dyadic trade imbalances and greater trade imbalances with trade partners’ alliances are statistically significantly associated with a higher likelihood of onset of militarized interstate disputes among dyads.",Tsinghua University,,,,,,,,Tsinghua University,,Yao Han,,,,,,,,Yao Han,,Conflict,International Relations,Political Economy,Security,Quantitative,Trade,Peace,,Trade Imbalances and Interstate Conflict Onset Embedded in Networks,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64947&EventID=185

The declaration is the first joint initiative within the WTO to increase women's participation in trade. Supporters of the declaration committed themselves, inter alia, to exchange experience and best practices on inclusive trade policies. In order to implement the Buenos Aires Declaration, the Informal Group on Trade and Gender was formed at the WTO. To support women’s economic empowerment some WTO members have introduced gender chapters into its Free Trade Agreements. WTO initiatives for women's economic empowerment seem particularly relevant given the strong negative impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on women's economic situation worldwide.

0,"The multilateral trading system is in crisis.  The question of how emerging economic powers, such as China and India, should be classified and treated under global trade rules has become an acute source of conflict at the World Trade Organization (WTO).  While the emerging powers insist that they should be entitled to special and differential treatment (SDT) based on their status as developing countries, established powers such as the US and EU complain vociferously about the prospect of extending special treatment to their emerging challengers.  With the debate over SDT dominated by the established and emerging powers, the interests of other developing countries have received comparatively little attention.  Drawing on the cases of agriculture and fisheries – two areas of international trade that are of particular importance to the developing world – I show that extending SDT to emerging economies is increasingly problematic for global development.  In these areas, many emerging economies are now among the world’s largest subsidizers, and the harmful effects of their policies are felt most keenly by other developing countries.  Granting SDT to exempt emerging economy subsidizers from WTO disciplines would therefore undermine efforts to use global trade rules to promote global development, as well as to protect the environment.",University of British Columbia,,,,,,,,University of British Columbia,,Kristen Hopewell,,,,,,,,Kristen Hopewell,,China,International Relations,Political Economy,Developing World Politics,WTO,Trade,Differentiation,,"Trade, Development and Power Shifts:  The Conflict over Special and Differential Treatment at the WTO",https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65291&EventID=185
0,"As the future of democracy is debated worldwide, this research focuses on the following puzzle: why does resilience against authoritarian populism emerge in some countries but not others? It offers a within-case process tracing technique and comparative case analysis for explaining how  the current literature on democratic backsliding can address the trajectories of authoritarian  populist regimes in Turkey and Brazil and how it is more likely for them to experience a return  towards democracy or move in the direction of a fully authoritarian consolidation. Both Turkey  and Brazil are paradigmatic cases, shifting towards authoritarianism in the last decade and offer  significant insights into the “democratic backsliding” literature for understanding the state-led  abolition of horizontal institutions compared to the advanced democracies in the Global North.  Selected case studies also represent the populists in power and different types of right-wing populism, such as Islamist populism in Turkey and pro-military populism in the left-wing political trajectory of Brazil. Both countries were recognized as electoral democracies in 2010 and are now seen in the top five autocratic countries of the world. However, Brazil is still categorized as a “democracy” although it is “electoral” and “flawed,” while Turkey is seen as an “electoral autocracy” or “hybrid regime” in internationally accepted democracy indices. There are authoritarian trends for both countries, but what are the institutional and ideological conditions that have allowed the current authoritarian regime in Turkey to consolidate authoritarian populist rule, are there similar conditions and mechanisms present in Brazil to allow an authoritarian populist to consolidate power, and if not, what prevents Brazil from authoritarian populist consolidation? The study mainly argues that a polarized society, the political economy of authoritarian populism and the weakening power of the civil society and critical thinking threaten an authoritarian populist consolidation in both Turkey and Brazil. However, institutional conditions in Turkey have paved the way for a greater move towards such a consolidation, thanks to the 20-year-long uninterrupted authoritarian populist control in the legislature, judiciary, bureaucracy, and media.",Koç University,,,,,,,,Koç University,,Gülşen Doğan,,,,,,,,Gülşen Doğan,,Europe (Central and Eastern),Comparative Politics,Democracy,Democratisation,Governance,Latin America,Populism,,Trajectories of Populism and the Future of Democracy in the Global South: A Comparative Study of Turkey and Brazil,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63867&EventID=185

0,"As the failures of current and predominantly market-based strategies to deal with the climate emergency are met with increased demands for urgent and radical action, politicians, activists and academics alike are (re)focusing on the State for its perceived ability to mobilise social and economic forces in a rapid post-carbon transition. However, such arguments to “bring the State back in” are misguided by their failure to recognise the liberal-capitalist state’s structural dependency on the pursuit of indefinite economic growth as the basis of capitalist development and (neo)liberal standards of prosperity. That is, in the absence of any proven or scalable technologies capable of achieving the absolute decoupling of economic growth from carbon emissions, this dependency represents an ecocidal imperative from which the State in its current form cannot be detached. In other words, the liberal-capitalist state cannot be “greened.” As such, this paper argues that a rapid post-carbon and post-growth transition therefore presupposes a radical post-liberal and post-capitalist transformation of the State.

The trend towards instrumentalising the State to radically decarbonise the economy represents the emergence of a “climate neo-statism,” most notable in the various proposals for a Green New Deal and Just Transition which are contingent on the State making considerable and contentious disruptive interventions in the economy and energy system. While interventions at these scales would be unprecedented in modern times, experiences of Covid-19 measures (e.g. lockdowns, mask mandates, welfare payments, etc.) and are now displayed as illustrating that states can act quickly and decisively in times of crisis. This framing therefore implies that inaction on the climate emergency is merely due to a lack of ambition and political will. To follow this climate neo-statist perspective, the logical course of action for activists is to apply greater pressure on politicians. This is however problematised by the extent to which the structural dependency of the liberal-capitalist state on capitalist growth undermines the agency of its institutions and actors to contravene the growth imperative. It is in this sense, then, that the liberal-capitalist state should be considered a barrier to rather than site of radical decarbonisation.

0,"Our paper focuses on plenary debates in parliament that deal with current crises such as climate crisis and flight and migration crisis, and it aims at assessing the implicit agendas of crisis processing in terms of democratic equality and representation. 
We start from a theoretical framework that conceptualises (1) parliament as the symbolic centre of representative democracy, (2) parliamentary rhetoric on different (political, societal and economic) crises as an expression of the way of dealing with the (alleged) crisis of representative democracy, and (3) analyses rhetorical shifts of understandings of democracy therein taking place as (potential) transformations of democracy. Hence, we argue that parliamentary debate analysis does not only facilitate the analysis of production and proliferation of solutions, but also allows to assess the transformation of democracy.
Against this backdrop, we examine understandings of democracy in parliamentary crisis rhetoric, and we ask whether these transformations indicate democratic backsliding or democratization. A solution to the crisis narrative of climate change, for instance, can take the form of sovereignty that enforces a masculinist version of the autonomous (political and capitalist) subject, or alternatively, it may include demands of social movements and activists to overcome exploitative relations of production in a global scale.

0,"Beginning with the UN Rio process on sustainable development and reinforced by the adoption of the Agenda 2030 and the Paris Climate Agreement, national governments around the world have established specialized political bodies for sustainability as part of their polities. These bodies range from governmental commissions, advisory councils, ombudspersons to parliamentary committees. They share, in substantial terms, an orientation towards sustainability, which I understand as socio-ecological well-being with a global and future-sensitive perspective. In structural terms, these bodies have in common a public mandate, a trans-departmental set-up, and a permanent place in the national polity. This is why I call such specialized political bodies sustainability institutions. And, although we know that they exist in the majority of countries in the world (as shown elsewhere by the author, article under review),  there is surprisingly little academic knowledge about whether and how they actually have an impact on promoting sustainability in policy-making. 
In the proposed paper, I will shed light on how sustainability institutions in practice influence political decision-making (or not), drawing on findings from a case study on Germany. I selected Germany as a case because it has several sustainability institutions that exist alongside and possibly complement each other: the Council for Sustainable Development, the Parliamentary Advisory Council for Sustainable Development, and the State Secretary Committee for Sustainable Development. 
The case study rests on a qualitative data analysis based on interviews with office-holders in sustainability institutions, government officials, parliamentarians, experts, civil society as well as business actors. The research design follows a deductive approach: I draw upon a previously created multi-dimensional analytical framework on sustainability institutions and conducive conditions as well as possible pathways to influence the stages in the policy cycle, developed based on existing literature in the field (article under review). The analytical framework facilitates the comprehensive assessment of sustainability institutions and thus informs the coding scheme for the qualitative data analysis. 
With the case study, I contribute to a better understanding of the phenomenon of sustainability institutions and their impact in practice. At the same time, the case study serves as a reality check for many of the assumptions underlying the conceptual framework, improving the framework for further empirical studies on sustainability institutions and their impact. Finally, the case study may also be useful as a basis for reforms of the institutional design of individual sustainability institutions in order to make these political bodies more meaningful.",German Institute of Development and Sustainability (IDOS),,,,,,,,German Institute of Development and Sustainability (IDOS),,Okka Lou Mathis,,,,,,,,Okka Lou Mathis,,Development,Environmental Policy,Green Politics,Institutions,Qualitative,Decision Making,Empirical,Policy-Making,Transformative institutions?

0,"The 2030 Agenda is the current global blueprint for guiding action towards sustainable development. This agenda is not the first one of this nature, but two flagship characteristics distinguish it from earlier ones. The first characteristic is its ambition for accelerated transformation by recognizing the interlinkages among the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and calling for an integrated approach. The second characteristic is its intended implementation mechanism. Unlike the other 16 goals, SDG 17 “Partnerships for the Goals”, does not focus on a specific issue area for development. Instead, it serves as a convener for all the other goals, calling for (multi-stakeholder) partnerships as the main vehicle of delivering sustainable development globally.

With these two flagship characteristics, the 2030 Agenda makes the implicit assumption that Multi-stakeholder Partnerships (MSPs) are both able and effective at facilitating nexus-formation among SDGs, providing a space for interaction, and creating synergies for transformation. Whether this is a valid assumption has not yet been scientifically examined, but it is a question that has recently started to receive academic attention, a trend that can be expected to increase during the Decade of Action. In order to ensure a fruitful analysis around this topic allowing comparability of findings, we argue that a common understanding of the foundational concepts is required.

0,"The concept of transitional justice (TJ) is often defined as the full range of processes and mechanisms associated with a society's attempts to come to terms with a legacy of large-scale past abuses, in order to ensure accountability, serve justice and achieve reconciliation. Prominent contributions to the field of conflict resolution view TJ as a post-conflict instrument. In reality, however, TJ activities are sometimes conducted while armed conflict is ongoing. Such TJ activities carried out by civil society actors during entrenched conflicts and are often conceived as pre-transitional justice (pre-TJ) (Kapshuk & Strömbom, 2021). a key element of pre-TJ during conflicts is to use and ‘copy’ procedures from the legal arena and from official institutions, and use those in the informal sphere of civil society activities to demand that authorities claim responsibility for past wrongs. These types of bottom-up perspective have challenged top-down legalist paradigms, which determine what is emphasised and what is marginalised (Kedar & Dudai, 2018). 

This study focuses on pre-TJ in Israel in the context of an ongoing Israeli-Palestinian intractable conflict. Since the collapse of the peace process between Israelis and Palestinians, and faced with socio-political unwillingness to engage in a discourse about accepting responsibility, Israeli civil society has developed its own versions of TJ as a means to provoke crucial discussions about how to deal with past injustices. One such activity is the ‘Streets of Jaffa’ project. Jaffa is an Arab-Jewish city and its streets names were changed to Hebrew names after the Palestinian exodus (Nakba) during the 1947–48 war, when more than 700,000 Palestinians fled or were expelled from their homes. ‘Street of Jaffa’ project commemorates Palestinian streets names by putting up additional street signs, in order to promote recognition of the Palestinian history of the area and creating partnership and reconciliation between Arab and Jewish residents in Jaffa. The aim of the study is to examine the way in which the action of pre-transitional justice is organized and its reactions and effects on different population groups. By doing so this study contributes to the scholarship on pre-TJ ‘from below’ during entrenched conflicts.",Kinneret College on the Sea of Galilee,,,,,,,,Kinneret College on the Sea of Galilee,,Yoav Kapshuk,,,,,,,,Yoav Kapshuk,,Civil Society,Conflict,Memory,Activism,Transitional justice,,,,Transitional Justice 'from below' during intractable conflicts: Reconciliation through the Streets of Jaffa?,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63885&EventID=185
0,"Recent research on policy controversies challenges us to rethink classical distinctions between angry citizens and rational politicians. Interpretive studies demonstrate empirically that politicians and citizens discursively express emotions and use rational arguments. These insights encouraged this explorative study into the ways governing actors discursively express emotions and how these relate to expressed emotions by other actors in an energy controversy. Based on a thematic analysis of 1,852 newspaper articles in the case of the gas-quakes controversy in the Netherlands – where gas production induced earth quakes – we empirically show that politicians reinterpret emotions expressed by the public through emotional storylines. Reinterpreting emotions of the public by politicians takes place in two ways: translating and transforming. Local and regional politicians in the way they talk about emotions translate the expressed feelings of the Groningen population into emotional storylines directed towards national politicians, and through that put pressure on national decision-making. National politicians, when attempting to discursively transform the publics’ emotions, (1) argue to take rational actions despite the publics’ emotions, (1) and while expressing empathy for negative emotions, suggest alternative emotions. As such, politicians’ storylines either serve as a vehicle for making the discursive expression of emotions part of the decision making and policy making processes, or their storylines serve to negate or transform unwanted emotions.",Wageningen University and Research Center,University of Amsterdam,,,,,,,Wageningen University and Research Center,,Tamara Metze,Imrat Verhoeven,,,,,,,Tamara Metze,,Conflict,Policy Analysis,Narratives,,,,,,Translating and transforming emotions: an exploration of the role of politicians’ emotional storylines in an energy controversy in the Netherlands,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64565&EventID=185
0,"In a country where the political disengagement been the norm in the past few years, a new phenomenon caught politicians and civil society`s attention: part of the very same disenchanted people that immigrated from Romania, had become increasingly interested in the politics of their country of origin and had shown their commitment for positive change through different actions such as: voting, organising large scale protests or sending money back home on a regular basis. 
It is in this context, of a little studied, large active diaspora- the fifth largest in the world according to OECD- that the aim of my project is to assess the extent and the determinants of the transnational political participation of Romanian migrants. In order to do that, I want to look at the political attitudes and behaviour of Romanians living in three north-western European countries: Luxembourg, Belgium and France, each of them accommodating significant communities of Romanian migrants. By comparing the political attitudes and behaviour of Romanian migrants living in these three European countries, I expect to see if the context of reception represents one of the determinants of the transnational political participation of the Romanian migrants, along with the socio political context of origin and the their social network. 
In terms of theoretical background, I will use both assimilationism and transnationalism perspectives in order to see where does the Romanian migrant place himself in the host country and what determinates him( if it is the case) to engage in transnational political activities. 
I intend using semi structured interviews with most of the questions created in advance, for the purpose of verifying the project hypothesis but I also want to allow participants to add details whenever they feel it is necessary. Romanian diaspora is not homogenous therefore I aim paying attention and analysing the individual trajectory of every single participant to the project, so that I can gather detailed and contextualized information, which in turn is not generalizable. I want to realise at least 20 interviews in each of these three cities: Luxembourg, Brussels and Paris, with migrants chosen through the snowball sampling method. In order to ensure sample diversity I aim gathering perspectives from Romanians having very diverse migrant profiles( for example Romanians who left their country before the fall of the communism, Romanians having acquired the nationality of their host country, Romanians who only left their country of origin for a couple of years, seasonal workers, etc.). Compared to other studies looking especially at the electoral political participation of different groups of migrants, I want to analyse the Romanian migrants` transnational engagement and I also plan looking at their social network and the way this one influences their relations with their host society as well as their country of origin.",University of Luxembourg,,,,,,,,University of Luxembourg,,Sorina Carstea,,,,,,,,Sorina Carstea,,Europe (Central and Eastern),Immigration,Qualitative,Political Activism,,,,,"Transnational political participation of Romanian migrants residing in North-western Europe Comparative case study of Luxembourg, Belgium and France",https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64179&EventID=185

Upon their arrival in Russia, they found out they are stuck in-between two discursive borders. On one hand, Ukraine has been continuously creating a hostile environment for their future reintegration, as Ukraine sees people who chose to flee to Russia carrying anti-Ukraine emotions. A most recent example is the draft law for opening up the recognition of multiple citizenships in Ukraine.  According to the law, multiple citizenships will be ratified in the future, but citizens of the aggressive state, that is, Russia, will be excluded. On the other hand, Russia insists on a Russian national identification and assimilation as the prerequisite for membership to the Russian society, and Russia has been trying to eliminate Ukrainian culture and language from the discourses on the displaced people from Donbas. Moreover, the conflict in Donbas was also followed by the persecution of some high-profile Ukrainian diaspora in Russia working in various Ukrainian cultural organizations or human rights civil societies. Hence, as Ukrainian refugees are experiencing these aforementioned forms of belonging and exclusion simultaneously, do these contradicting discourses regarding their identity also polarize their sense of being? There are already some studies that may be helpful for answering the question. Theoretically, as James Scott’s well-known argument also resonates here, modern states tend to use state power to simplify intricate social realities and to make them controllable. The knowledge produced by the Ukrainian and Russian states may not accurately reflect Ukrainian refugees’ self-position and the fluidity of their identity in different temporal and spatial contexts. Empirically, a recent surveyed-based study by Sasse and Lackner (2020) informs us that by comparing the political views of displaced people from Donbas across different locations, there is not an evident tendency of polarisation and there are actually many similarities between internally and externally displaced people in various political issues. The research question of the proposed study, therefore, asks the ways they imagine themselves and their self-positioning with regard to two opposite political and, arguably, cultural communities. As social media functions as one of the few platforms where Ukrainian refugees in Russia can relatively express themselves freely, the proposed study will conduct digital ethnography in Russian and Ukrainian social media, focusing on qualitative content analysis and critical discourse analysis. The proposed study will focus on their creative ways to reclaim and remake the vocabularies of belonging, paying particular attention to the ways in which Ukrainian refugees unmake the discursive borders and negate border logics and methodological nationalism way of thinking.",University College London,,,,,,,,University College London,,Qianrui Hu,,,,,,,,Qianrui Hu,,Citizenship,Nationalism,Identity,War,Refugee,,,,Transnational Resistance against Discursive Borders: Remaking Vocabularies of Belonging among Ukrainian Refugees in Russia,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64139&EventID=185
0,"National and international strategic partnerships in European higher education (HE) have become a growing phenomenon (Engel et al., 2015), as recognized in university-industry relations (Poyago-Theotoky, Beath & Siegel, 2002; Frolund & Riedel, 2018), branch campuses (Shams & Huisman, 2011; Wilkins & Huisman, 2012; Kosmützky, 2018), or inter-university projects to enhance cooperation and collaboration in teaching and research production (Marques, Zapp & Powell, 2020; Fumasoli & Rossi, 2021). The European Union policy initiatives under the European Higher Education Area certainly contributed to such a development within Europe. However, while HE scholarship has studied national and international strategic partnerships, less attention has been paid to transnational ones. The latter refers to strategic partnerships that surpass and cut across national and single-organizational boundaries (despite their capacity to impact local and national levels) to build transnational structures (Djelic & Sahlin-Andersson, 2006). The European Universities Initiative (EUI), created by the European Commission in 2017, is a recent novel phenomenon within the European Union policy toolkit with an explicit transnational dimension for European HE. Thus, it aims at strengthening transnational strategic partnerships in European HE through the establishment of several European Universities by 2024. The policy initiative intends to achieve this ambition through the creation of bottom‐up networks of universities that will enable students to obtain combined degrees in several EU countries, foster research collaboration, and enhance the competitiveness of European universities (European Council, 2017). To date, the EUI counts 41 European university alliances, involving a total of 280 HE institutions (HEI) (European Commission, 2020). Following the rationale of the panel proposal, we argue that the EUI, as a new transnational governance mechanism, can be seen as a significant structural reform for European HE whose impacts are yet to be explored. Given its recent design and implementation, the paper charts the institutional features of the EUI aimed at fostering transnational strategic partnerships within European HE. We thus address the following question: what are the main regulative, normative, and cultural-cognitive institutional dimensions of the EUI as a new transnational governance mechanism?
Theoretically, the paper is anchored in new institutionalism and applies the three institutional dimensions (related to rules, standards, and ideas respectively) (Scott, 2008) to analyze the EUI as a transnational governance mechanism (Djelic & Sahlin-Andersson, 2006) both at the European policy level and at the organizational level. Methodologically, the paper is supported by a qualitative approach. At the European policy level, we analyze semi-structured interviews with European policy-makers and the EUI’s official policy documents. At the organizational level, we analyze the strategic documents of the entire population of transnational strategic partnerships (n=41) supported by the EUI. Our neo-institutionalist analysis finds that at the European policy level, the EUI appears as a ‘next level of cooperation’ in European HE, since these transnational strategic partnerships have a long-term vision, whose aim is to transform cooperation between universities that becomes systematically structural. At the organizational level, the results point to a variety of forms in which strategic partnerships govern transnational organizational structures, shape university missions, and redefine European HE.",Hertie School,Hertie School,,,,,,,Hertie School,,Marcelo Marques,Lukas Graf,,,,,,,Lukas Graf,,European Union,Governance,Higher Education,,,,,,Transnational Strategic Partnerships in Higher Education: The European Universities Initiative as the ‘next level of cooperation’?,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64321&EventID=185
0,"Transparency and accountability have been key drivers of governance agendas for the past decades. The rising concern for opening up government institutions to social scrutiny has also led to a growing output of academic inquiries focusing on a multitude of issues. From budget planning to democratic innovation in participatory mechanisms, the local has been the centre of attention of many scholars studying the causes and effects of transparency at this governance level. With a sample of 57 papers published over the last twenty years this articles provides a systemic review of the findings and insights scholars have arrived through the lens of transparency and accountability. The articles cover a wide range of themes, as well as methods and epistemic approaches, and display the multidisciplinarity characterising the study of the local. We highlight the role of technology in conceiving, designing, and implementing transparency at the locality. From this digitally-mediated perspective, we interrogate the role of multi-level governance, and, whether from a national, regional, or international rung, analyse the interrelations and dynamics therein. We identify a trend towards collaborative plans aimed at taking the local governance closer to society in regards of finance and budgets, data formats and open contracting.

0,"We analyze the evolution of perceived corruption after countries join the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI). Using country-year panel data and a corruption index that is comparable over time, we find no evidence that corruption is reduced in the years following EITI membership. On the contrary, there is evidence of an increase in corruption in low income autocratic countries subsequent to joining the initiative. These results hold for both standard difference-in-difference estimation, and for more sophisticated methods that address estimation challenges that arise when countries become EITI members at different times. We see no evidence that late-comers to the initiative have experienced more favourable corruption outcomes than early joiners. The increase in corruption in low income countries does not seem to be driven by increased foreign investment or aid. Instead, the increase appears to be driven by autocratic countries whose regimes rely on perfomance legitimation strategies to justify their continued hold on power. This is consistent with EITI accession being used as a signal of regime competence and legitimacy, permitting more extensive elite corrupt activity.",Norwegian School of Economics,,,,,,,,Norwegian School of Economics,,Ivar Kolstad,,,,,,,,Ivar Kolstad,,Democracy,Governance,Political Economy,International,Quantitative,Corruption,,,Transparently corrupt?

0,"Despite a burgeoning literature exploring the role and effect of judicial councils, little to no attention has been so far paid to the question how they impact the dynamics between the three branches of power. This paper aims to fill this gap and theorize about the place and role of judicial councils in the separation of powers. Based on the analysis of over 150 interviews with judges, politicians, and lawyers from 6 European countries (Czechia, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Slovakia) the paper shows that there are huge normative discrepancies in how actors of judicial governance think about the role and function of judicial councils. In fact, judicial councils do not neatly fit within any of the three traditional branches of the state. Instead, there are at least three different understandings of judicial councils: (A) judicial council as a representative of the judicial branch (judge-centred judicial council), (B) judicial council as a coordinating institution representing all three traditional branches of power (interbranch judicial council), and (C) judicial council as a post-branch body (impartial judicial council). As paper demonstrates, all judicial councils gravitate to one of those models, while only the post-branch type secures sufficient checks and balances and prevents the capture of the judiciary by political or internal forces",Masaryk University,Masaryk University,,,,,,,Masaryk University,,David Kosar,Katarina Sipulova,,,,,,,Katarina Sipulova,,Democracy,Political Theory,Courts,Domestic Politics,,,,,Triple understanding of judicial councils,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65696&EventID=185
0,"What public intellectual roles do conservative academics play in this era of populist politics?  One measure of political activism by academics is their participation in think tanks external to the university. Vying with the media and universities, think tanks have come to exert tremendous amounts of symbolic power by helping to shape how policy makers, political leaders, and journalists understand the social world. They are prime sites where academics can exercise public intellectual roles. This paper identifies the think tank participation of 100 US conservative academics who supported the Trump presidency and continue to support Trumpism. The paper examines the network affiliations to major think tanks where these individuals try to influence the public agenda with their views in support of Trumpism. Most of these academic Trumpists hold professorships in mainstream research universities yet tend to be concentrated in just a few schools.  Moreover, they tend to be concentrated in just a few nationally important think tanks that project a narrow and extreme right-wing political ideological orientation. One such think tank stands out: the Claremont Institute in California.   This research invites cross-national comparisons with conservative European Academics who support right-wing populist movements and governments.  Particular attention will be given to the case of the Institut de sciences sociales, économiques et politiques (ISSEP) in Lyon, France with close ties to Marion Maréchal and the extreme right.

0,"Previous regulation scholarship is concerned with regulatory authorities’ weak democratic legitimacy. The aim of this article is to provide an overview of the state of the art in the literature on European Union (EU) agencies, and their main findings. In particular, we cover studies on different institutional characteristics of EU agencies, such as transparency, accountability, control, representation, independence, and the participation of stakeholders and interest groups. We also review previous work focused on reputation. In the second part of the article, we present credible commitment and trust as two dimensions that can act as potential turning points in the study of EU agencies. We show that there is a considerable gap in the literature that is worth filling. Under pressures of capacity and uncertainty, governments often delegate authority to expert institutions to act on their behalf. But trust is an important condition for such delegation. Thus, in the third part of this article, we examine the role of trust as a potential turning point in EU regulatory bodies. To illustrate, we analyze the case of the food safety sector in general, and the European Food Safety Authority in particular.

0,"The spread of armed drones and the possession of UAVs from powerful states to non-states actors has been a source of concern and has ignited a heated debate on the consequences of drone proliferation for international and regional security. This paper examines the underexplored issue of Turkey’s drones diplomacy and the instrumentalization of drones in foreign policy. Thus, it contributes to the literature of Turkish foreign policy as well as to the literature on drones warfare by putting in the spotlight the case of Turkey. 
Turkish Foreign Policy has undergone structural changes especially when Recep Tayyip Erdogan undertook the Presidency and adopted a more assertive foreign policy. In that frame, this paper contends that Turkey uses its robust domestic arms industry twofold: to coerce and to influence. Turkish military bases from Caucasus and Eastern Mediterranean to the Horn of Africa, along with its military operations in Iraq, Syria and Libya illustrate the use of  drones for coercive purposes in order to pursue its revisionist agenda especially in the Eastern Mediterranean. Furthermore, it shows how a state can enhance its power by using arms sales to influence its external environment, as it happens under the Presidency of Erdogan. Finally, this paper challenges literature that degrades the consequences of drone proliferation for regional security. The example of Turkey that has emerged as an upcoming drone power but simultaneously does not hesitate to use them in different conflicts raises concerns both on regional security and civilian casualties resulted by the not so ‘precision strikes’ as well as by failed surveillance of migration flows that has an immense cost on human lives.",University of Macedonia,,,,,,,,University of Macedonia,,Stella Gerani,,,,,,,,Stella Gerani,,Conflict,Elites,Foreign Policy,International Relations,Realism,Domestic Politics,Power,Influence,Turkey’s Drones Diplomacy.

0,"While scholars in the realist tradition of International Relations often presume that states primarily seek material security through their foreign policies, other approaches within the discipline question how such national interests are formulated. Researchers in political psychology have noted that state leaders often seem more motivated to pursue social status vis-à-vis other states rather than acting in strategic ways more likely to reduce the threat of material harm or avert military risks. Applying Henri Tajfel’s notion of Social Identity Theory to states themselves, political psychology IR scholars like Deborah Larson and Alexei Shevchenko have observed states (such as Russia and China) acting in ways that closely resemble individual attempts to renegotiate status within hierarchies: seeking to emulate members of higher-status groups, using creativity to increase one’s social value by adopting new strategies to raise one’s social rank, and/or directly challenging high-status individuals to claim that member’s rank in the hierarchy.   

This paper tests hypotheses drawn from Social Identity Theory, Constructivism, and Realism using case studies from Turkish foreign policy since the founding of the Turkish Republic in 1923. Like today’s Russia and China, the Turkish state that emerged from the ashes of the Ottoman Empire bore a historical memory of imperial grandeur. However, throughout most of its history Turkish political leaders showed comparatively little appetite for revanchism - until the present day. This paper divides Turkish history into four periods in which it appeared to pursue status through different social strategies: 1923-1945, when the young Turkish Republic displayed ‘social creativity’ and focused on modernization plans inspired by both Western and Soviet sources, while remaining neutral and independent; 1946-2003, when it pursued ‘social mobility’ and sought its place within a NATO and US-led Western order; 2003-2014, when Turkey adopted ‘social creativity’ again, pursuing closer ties with both East and West while drawing on Ottoman legacies to enhance its soft power in its near abroad; and 2014-today, when Turkey challenges its NATO allies and competes with Russia and Iran to be a regional standalone power.

Can these phases be explained more convincingly by analyzing Turkey’s hard security interests, or by expanding the concept of national interests to include the pursuit of socially-experienced feelings of status within hierarchical relationships? Are Constructivist explanations more effective in explaining these different phases, with their belief in the socializing power of interstate interactions, or does Social Identity Theory, with its attention to social competition and hierarchy, perform better?

Populism in Turkish politics has been on the rise with an authoritarian turn of the AKP government since 2013. This phenomenon has impacted not only on Turkey’s domestic politics but also on its foreign policy. This article examines Turkish foreign policy since 2013 by trying to decipher the in-terplay between securitization and populism. It argues that the foreign policy conducted during the AKP period is based on the securitization of some themes and actors along with populist politics and the security framings in domestic politics shape the content of the category of “enemy” in for-eign policy. To this end, this study reveals how securitization moves that have been instrumentalized by the AKP to attain legitimacy and consolidate power in domestic politics lead to unstable rela-tions in its foreign policy.

0,"Hungary and Poland have been leading the wave of anti-democratic and anti-European developments in the European Union. Both countries set out to build an illiberal democracy using a right-wing nationalist rhetoric that promised to return power from the corrupt elites to the people to help the nation stand up from its knees. This paper argues that despite this “vox populi” rhetoric, the Fidesz and PiS governments have undertaken political reforms that turn citizens into spectators with a very limited say or take in politics but are passive objects of propaganda and disinformation. We see the making of spectators as the diametric opposite of the historical dynamics of citizenship, where citizenship is understood as an expansion process to include new types of rights (civil, political and social) to an ever-larger number of societal groups (Marshall 1950). We understand citizenship to have three main elements or dimensions (Cohen 1999; Kymlicka and Norman 2000; Carens 2000): citizenship as legal status, as political agency of the country’s political institutions, and as membership in a political community. We argue Fidesz’s and PiS’s populist politics empty citizenship of all its meaning, populist strategies mask authoritarian policies that limit social, political, and legal aspects of contemporary citizenship. This is only exacerbated by the radical expansion of visual mass media such as TV, internet and social media and the rise of “homo videns” (Sartori 1997), who clings to pictures, video messages and crude entertainment, becoming spectators instead active citizens. This way “spectator democracy” captures the internal logic of illiberal democracy, where political actors are in control of media and can influence public opinion (unlike in audience democracy [Manin 1997]), while citizens are alienated from the political process. Move towards more-and-more authoritarian systems ensures there are no “candor moments” (Green 2009), there are no controls on executive power and citizens cannot exercise agency of political institutions. Populism is employed to increase societal polarization and redefine the political community to the extent that security that citizenship is to provide cannot be enjoyed as it itself cannot be secured against authorities themselves. Last but not least, complex political decisions are simplified into pro and con decisions to ensure leaders can be sustained by acclamation rather than critical evaluation. This way, politics becomes a media show, tightly controlled by government, transforming citizens into spectators who pass judgment based on the politician’s media performance, often based on propaganda, fake news or straight lies.",University of Leipzig,Central European University,,,,,,,Central European University,,Ireneusz Pawel Karolewski,Robert Sata,,,,,,,Robert Sata,,Europe (Central and Eastern),Citizenship,Democracy,Media,Populism,Political Engagement,,,Turning citizens into spectators,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65169&EventID=185

To avoid undermining the stability and predictability of law, courts are unsurprisingly loath to overrule existing precedent. Previous studies suggest that the rare occasions of courts overturning precedent are tied to ideological differences between a past precedent’s authors and the judges currently sitting on the bench. In this paper, I argue that this observed relationship is conditional on current judges learning that continued adherence to past precedent would lead to unfavourable societal outcomes. The model shows that information supplied by governmental and non-governmental actors during case proceedings allows judges to update their beliefs about the actual effects of precedent on relevant stakeholders, and to decide when to leave even precedent crafted by a predecessor with divergent preferences on the books and when it is time to chart a new path in jurisprudence.",Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München – LMU,,,,,,,,Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München – LMU,,Philipp Schroeder,,,,,,,,Philipp Schroeder,,Interest Groups,Courts,Jurisprudence,Decision Making,,,,,Turning corners: The role of third-party briefs in overruling precedent,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63210&EventID=185

Born as a protest phenomenon in the Northern Region of Italy, the party has changed its platform several times, evolving into a secessionist movement outside the main coalitions to then approach a more moderate regionalism firmly rooted within the centre-right. In the last ten years, under the leadership of Matteo Salvini, the party has reinvented itself once again. The League has become a radical right-wing populist party with a national projection, albeit several internal tensions about this transformation have erupted. While this party has been extensively studied with regards to its organisation and ideology, far less attention has been paid to its representatives elected at the local level and their career developments. This is indeed a fundamental perspective to understand the transformations of this political chameleon, which has given a great deal of emphasis to the regions for a large part of its history.

0,"This paper investigates the role of so-called “two-level” connectors in the German climate policy network. These connectors are organizations or individuals strongly linked to both the formulation of the international commitments and the national policy level. Looking at these connections is crucial since the commitments as formulated in the national determined contributions (NDCs) must be translated into national policies. Thus, the degree to which a country is able to harmonize its climate policy with its international promises strongly depends on the domestic policy process and the actors therein. The prevailing constellations (i.e. the degree of actor involvement at different levels and sectors) and the constellation of actor’s preferences (i.e. the degree of belief conflict in a policy subsystem) determine the level of policy harmonization by influencing the political feasibility of climate policies. In line with policy network literature, we argue that policy adoption is not a decision by single actors, but the outcome of government agencies and stakeholders coordinating their activities and cooperation to advocate for their interests. They form a policy network of interactions and venues of participation. If this policy network is dominated by a small number of key actors, policy adoption is in the hands of few, and thus, happens more in a top-down fashion, simplifying the policy process. In contrast, when many actors compete for influence, decision-making processes are usually more complex (e.g. in federal or corporatist political systems). Hence, we expect that the degree of vertical policy harmonization is low in complex and conflictive policy networks. In contrast, in policy networks where two-level connectors are highly central, well connected, belong to the category of state actors, or are perceived to be influential we expect the degree of harmonization to be higher. We study these expectations for the German case. Empirically, we draw on a survey of the climate policy network conducted in 2021. Further, we use data from the vertical climate policy harmonization index to measure the gap between Germany’s international commitments and national policies. We test our expectations using descriptive network statistics, such as centrality, and inferential network models.",Universität Bern,Universität Bern,Universität Bern,,,,,,Universität Bern,,Lukas Fesenfeld,Karin Ingold,Marlene Kammerer,,,,,,Lukas Fesenfeld,,Public Policy,Coalition,Climate Change,,,,,,Two level connectors in German climate politics,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65117&EventID=185

We aim to discuss these issues, by presenting the first conclusions of the research made under the scope of PPEACE (Public Policies and Reception of Foreign Citizens Project), co-financed by the Asylum, Migration, and Integration Fund (AMIF).
The Project aims to contribute to scientific advancement in Public Policies and better-informed policy options for the reception of asylum seekers and refugees, in Europe and particularly in Portugal. Based on the results of 183 questionnaires applied between October 2020 and February 2021to asylum seekers and refugees, public entities, and NGO representatives - discussed in a focus group -, we analyze the impact that the pandemic had on public policies for reception and integration, including the access of this vulnerable population to public resources, satisfaction of basic needs, and most affected dimensions, according to the perceptions of the interviewees.
The results of this empirical study demonstrate that the perceptions of recipients and implementers of public policies in times of COVID19 are two sides of the same mirror, and can differ considerably.

0,"Transnational public-private or multi-stakeholder partnerships (MSPs) for sustainable development have multiplied since the World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg 2002. Some researchers view MSPs as new, hybrid governance arrangements that can make up for implementation gaps and democratic deficits in global governance. They argue that cross-sectoral, deliberative, and iterative governance of MSPs could address the wicked, i.e. inherently uncertain, conflictual and complex problems we face. Other scholarly analyses have questioned the effectiveness of MSPs. There have also been analyses that outline a lack of accountability and legitimacy. This paper moves beyond this debate and engages with the underlying rationales and strategies of actors involved in MSPs – an emerging field of research. It shows that irrespective of their effectiveness, MSPs are still being used. For example, the 2030 Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) re-legitimized MSPs as one of the means of implementation in SDG 17. There is a need for improved understanding of the United Nation’s (UN) role in this, an important topic the literature has mostly neglected. This is underlined by existing scholarly work, which highlights that the UN plays an activist role and mobilises coalitions to advance MSPs as institutional change. It has also been argued that MSPs constitute a legitimation strategy by the UN. This paper builds upon this and demonstrates a shift in UN meta-governance, i.e. its frameworks and guidance, for MSPs following the 2030 Agenda, presenting them as transformative instruments. The aim of this paper is to scrutinise this practice more closely. It first maps the UN involvement in MSPs for the 2030 Agenda – asking which UN agencies typically collaborate in what kinds of MSPs (i.e. function and governance structure), involving what kind of actors and working on which issue areas. The paper then analyses the different discourses and practises UN agencies use in the realm of MSPs, focusing specifically on transformation. It thereby demonstrates that protracted contestations between UN agencies on what transformation entails, and more specifically on MSPs fit for transformation, persist. Lastly the paper discusses what implications this has for UN-metagovernance for MSPs and the implementation of the 2030 Agenda.",Stockholm University,,,,,,,,Stockholm University,,Felicitas Fritzsche,,,,,,,,Felicitas Fritzsche,,Governance,Institutions,UN,International,,,,,UN meta-governance for MSPs – fit for transformation?,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65272&EventID=185
0,"In recent decades, many people have been lifted out of poverty, both within numerous countries and around the globe.  Global populisms nevertheless cultivate an “us-versus- them” picture of the general public versus policy makers, seemingly indicating a malperformance and discontent with government in a great many countries. The cleavage between standards of living on the one hand and discontent with government on the other hand remains somewhat of a puzzling phenomenon.
The fact that real incomes and living standards have improved in  numerous countries and for a great many individuals stands in stark contrast with the discontent with government seemingly showing up in populist movements around the world. By marrying microdata of the 2017-2020 European and World Values Surveys on confidence in government with text-mining data on uncertainty as provided by the World Uncertainty Index this paper explores in a cross-sectional ordered logit analysis how narratives as to insecurity undermine confidence in government and thus provide fertile ground for political conflict. This paper lends support to the notion that perceptions about uncertainty are negatively correlated with confidence in government.
Borrowing from these insights of micro-based research for macro issues of regime satisfaction suggests that populisms reflecting distrust in government are particularly strong where politics fails to cater to a quest for security and stability of expectations. Alas, to conclude that government consumption, often considered social insurance, would twist results favorably for government is mistaken. What matters is institutions lending stability to expectations.",Helmut-Schmidt-University/University of the Armed Forces Hamburg,Helmut-Schmidt-University/University of the Armed Forces Hamburg,,,,,,,Helmut-Schmidt-University/University of the Armed Forces Hamburg,,Barbara Dluhosch,Ana Soliz de Stange,,,,,,,Ana Soliz de Stange,,Government,Institutions,Political Economy,Populism,Public Policy,,,,Uncertainty – A Unifying Approach to Populism and Confidence in Government,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63592&EventID=185
0,"Waltz’s structural realism remains a mainstay in IR – be it a controversial one. While advocates see a parsimonious theory that explains the fundamentals of international politics, critics stress its limitations and propose additional hypotheses or alternative theories. We argue that the arguments on both sides display flaws that need remediation. In our view, the role of structure in international politics (i.e., anarchy and the distribution of power), and related uncertainty about intentions, is insufficiently understood. Therefore, we develop a baseline theory showing how structure and uncertainty drive international politics. First, we investigate how the type of uncertainty – i.e., the degree of uncertainty about states’ intentions to use force and the time horizon over which the uncertainty extends itself – impacts how structure affects its units’ behavior. Second, we explore to what extent the distribution of power affects the type of uncertainty under which great powers operate. The combination of both insights results in a theory that provides a deeper understanding of the crucial role of structure in international politics. As a result, our theory brings progress in many ongoing debates on the role of uncertainty in international politics and offers a bridge to other IR schools.",Vrije Universiteit Brussel,Vrije Universiteit Brussel,,,,,,,Vrije Universiteit Brussel,,Gustaaf Geeraerts,Nikolas Vander Vennet,,,,,,,Nikolas Vander Vennet,,International Relations,Security,Realism,,,,,,"Uncertainty, Polarity, and the Security Dilemma: Rethinking Structural Realism",https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63279&EventID=185
0,"In response to policy demands posed by climate change, the city of Amsterdam wants to develop 17 wind turbines within its municipal boundaries. This has led to loud protests from various local and neighboring groups. We were hired as policy mediators and facilitators to promote recognition, understanding, and dialogue between the parties. However, due to various reasons the decision process came under a lot of pressure, leading to feelings of tokenistic involvement from those who participated. In this paper I will share my experience of being involved in the dynamics of this policy conflict.
 
This paper is based on my own experience. My involvement started when public protests against wind turbines in Amsterdam increased and the city council decided that a moment of reflection would engage stakeholder groups in a dialogue. In this paper I will describe a number of critical moments in the city's wind policy participation process. The problems that we -as a team of mediators- have met, raised many questions about conflict as default, which makes it worth exploring in this panel.
  
I still wonder if this participation process has been successful or not. From a perspective of policy participation, this process is not the bright example that should be taught to students. But at the same time there was room for self-organization and initiative from the citizens. Apart from our advice to participants, all kinds of initiatives arose in which residents themselves influenced the political process. Others decided to stop participating as an act of protest and out of fear for tokenism, trying to influence political decision making by following a different strategy.",University of Amsterdam,,,,,,,,University of Amsterdam,,Marc Rijnveld,,,,,,,,Marc Rijnveld,,Citizenship,Conflict,Political Participation,Social Justice,Negotiation,,,,Under Pressure: citizen participation in the shadow of urgent climate policy.,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65013&EventID=185
0,"Policy-conflicts are booming. The increasingly interdependent structures involved in policy-practices and the increasing complexity of policy themes such as climate change, migration, planning, and youth care provide an ideal breeding ground for disagreements, disputes, and more serious types of conflict. When these large policy themes are expressed in cases that are concrete, grounded and localized, stakeholders can find themselves stuck in conflicts that are hard to oversee or even understand, leaving them feeling uncertain about their next move (Ansell and Boin 2019). 

Pragmatic interventions based upon relational action science can provide valuable insights into these grounded situations, assisting stakeholders to find a way to restore their relations and find a way out of the impasse (Bartels and Wittmeyer 2019; Kuitenbrouwer, 2021). In these situations: “Analysis does not precede and guide action … but emerges interactively, pragmatically, and deliberatively with it” (Forester, Kuitenbrouwer, and Laws, 2019, p 457). By adopting a relational stance and introducing different forms of frame-reflection, the focus of these pragmatic interventions is not so much to find consensus, as to understand and repair the relational patterns between stakeholders that led to conflict in the first place and contributed to the subsequent controversy. 

This paper presents a framework for understanding the relational dynamics in a policy-conflict that can help to identify and orient the pragmatic interventions that can repair relational dynamics in the local context of a policy conflict. The analysis is based on empirical research in over 10 cases. Three archetypal relational dynamics of policy-conflicts are proposed in light of this analysis. Subsequently, following Emirbayers and Mische’s (1998) conceptualisation of agency as informed by the past, projected towards the future, and practically evaluative within contingencies of the present, three basic transferable outlines for interventions that can restore relations are suggested.",University of Amsterdam,,,,,,,,University of Amsterdam,,Martien Kuitenbrouwer,,,,,,,,Martien Kuitenbrouwer,,Conflict,Conflict Resolution,Democracy,Governance,Local Government,,,,Understanding and repairing relational dynamics in localized policy-conflicts – a framework for analysis and action,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65286&EventID=185
0,"Social media nowadays are powerful tools for communication, information gathering and coalitions building, which interest groups use as part of their lobbying repertoires to influence policy. However, social media also present important challenges, e.g., managing high-traffic information flow, information overload, enhanced levels of public scrutiny, and potential reputational costs. This motivates interest groups to be both rational and purposeful regarding their social media usage, especially when connecting to decision-makers that possess an electoral and representation mandate such as legislators. As such, interest groups decide to follow and connect on social media with some legislators, while ignoring others. What explains this decision-making process remains a question. We address this puzzle and focus empirically on Twitter, a social media platform that established itself as a key political communication tool employed by elected officials and interest groups. We elaborate a theoretical argument that emphasises on the one hand the importance of the institutional roles performed by legislators as political and policy (expert) actors, and, on the other hand, on the different set of incentives interest groups have to use Twitter as an electoral-oversight and information-gathering device. We test our argument on a unique dataset recoding information Twitter ties between more than 7,000 interest groups and the legislators serving the eighth European Parliament (EP8). With the help of bipartite Exponential Random Graph Models (ERGMs), we examine the extent to which key characteristics of MEPs as political and policy actors shape interest groups’ decision about which legislators to follow on Twitter, while controlling for network- and actor-level factors. We thus contribute to the emerging and sparse literature on lobbying and social media in Europe and beyond, and the well-established research on the formation and dynamics of policy and political networks.",Universitetet i Bergen,Universitetet i Bergen,Central European University,,,,,,Central European University,,Adriana Bunea,Raimondas Ibenskas,Florian Weiler,,,,,,Florian Weiler,,European Union,Interest Groups,European Parliament,,,,,,Understanding interest groups - legislators ties on social media networks: the case of the European Parliament.,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63196&EventID=185
0,"Jihadist terrorist networks are a crucial manifestation of political violence and continue to be a key challenge to peace in many parts of the world. Al-Qaida and the Islamic State are among the networks constituting the greatest tests for countering political violence. To successfully address political violence associated with Al-Qaida and the Islamic State, it is key to analyze and compare their organizational structures. However, there has been little comparative research on similarities and differences in their network structures. This article conducts a comparative social network analysis of Al-Qaida and the Islamic State using a novel dataset generated from the Security Council ISIL (Da’esh) and Al-Qaida sanctions list. The findings underline three key arguments. First, terrorist networks differ remarkably in their organizational structure depending on the stage of their life cycles. We find that established terrorist networks like Al-Qaida tend to organize themselves in an operational security structure while younger terrorist networks such as the Islamic State display a scale-free structure. Second, brokers that connect different terrorist networks play an important role in understanding network growth and structure. Such brokers might also lead to escalation between networks as they compete for them. Third, measures to counter terrorist political violence need to take the different life cycle stages of Jihadist terrorist networks into account to disrupt these networks preventively and effectively. Such measures also need to consider relevant brokers between different networks.",Universität Potsdam,German Institute for Global And Area Studies,,,,,,,Universität Potsdam,,Thomas Doerfler,Eric Stollenwerk,,,,,,,Thomas Doerfler,,Extremism,International Relations,Political Violence,Security,Terrorism,UN,,,Understanding Jihadist Terrorist Networks: Differences and Commonalities in the Network Structure of Al-Qaida and the Islamic State,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63235&EventID=185
0,"This paper advances our understanding of networked advocacy – loose mobilising structures founded on “weak” online ties between policy actors – in the Advocacy Coalition Framework (ACF). We apply our investigation to the politics of deforestation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). In the paper, we argue that the expansion of information technology and new media is challenging established forms of policy communication across policy domains and geographies by providing coalitions with new tools to expand the scope of policy issues and pool influence to pursue their policy goals. In particular, the paper complements the ACF with perspectives on networked advocacy to frame “donor dynamics” as an advocacy strategy that takes advantage of the multilevel architecture of the policy process to channel influence on national brick-and-mortar institutions by appealing to international actors and their constituencies. Such an architecture describes the deforestation domain in the country that holds one of the largest areas of primary rainforest in the Congo Basin, and in which the politics of halting deforestation are condensed into conflicts between conservation, humanitarian goals, and the continuation of (unsustainable) resource exploitation by domestic and international business interests. To analyse the role of networked advocacy for coalition formation and advocacy strategies, we apply network methods to Twitter data on retweets and mentions between 150 key policy organisations and their affiliates since 2017 when DRC ratified the Paris Agremeent. As retweeting translates into potentially risky endorsement of politically charged content, filtering the retweet networks by keywords allows for determining the decisive features of advocacy coalitions: coordination and shared beliefs. The paper concludes by proposing areas for future work on networked advocacy that serve to promote the applicability of the ACF to policy contexts in the DRC, the Congo Basin, and beyond.",University of Helsinki,,,,,,,,University of Helsinki,,Arttu Malkamäki,,,,,,,,Arttu Malkamäki,,Africa,Coalition,Social Media,Climate Change,Communication,,,,Understanding networked advocacy in the multilevel policy process for halting deforestation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65174&EventID=185
0,"Policy instruments, i.e. the tools used by governments to allocate resources, distribute budgets, and influence behaviour, are a crucial dimension of governing sustainability transformations. A series of reforms of the EU's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) since 1992 have added sustainability-related objectives and instruments. However, rather than effectively addressing new challenges such as environmental degradation or animal welfare, they primarily serve to sustain the exceptionalist legacy of income support for farmers (Alons, 2017). One aspect that has received limited consideration in post-exceptionalism literature is that policy instruments are not merely tools to achieve contingent objectives, but also bearers of information about political interactions.

We apply a political sociology perspective to re-evaluate processes of change in the CAP. Following this approach, policy instruments “reveal a (fairly explicit) theorisation of the relationship between the governing and the governed” (Lascoumes & Le Gales, 2007, p. 11). Instruments constitute a “condensed form of knowledge about social control and ways of exercising it” (ibid.). By examining the CAP’s historical development from this perspective, Grant (2010) has shown how policy changes can be explained by the exhaustion and long-term contradictions of policy instruments that in the 1990s were no longer in tune with broader political trends. Internal contradictions and external pressures combined led to substantial change in the CAP instruments away from price support towards direct income transfers. More than a decade after Grant’s analysis, it is time to re-assess the role of CAP’s internal contradictions and external pressures, given the enormous challenges reflected e.g. in the European Green Deal. 

In this paper, we ask what the CAP instruments tell about the politics of sustainable transformation in agri-food policy. Based on a qualitative content analysis of the EU’s legislative texts for the CAP 2023-2027 and its implementation in Germany, we reconstruct the implicit theories of social control underlying the changing policy instruments in the CAP. The recent reform introduced a ""new delivery model"" that requires member states to link all instruments – including income support measures – to specific objectives, and explain the intervention mechanism. While this reflects external pressures to legitimize the CAP by aligning it with socially desired outcomes, it also betrays shifting theories of social control. New instruments e.g. Eco Schemes, Social Conditionality or animal-related interventions indicate that long-established income transfers are increasingly linked to conditions that express a changing social contract with stronger regards for ecological entities, labour rights, or animals. This new governance arrangement expands public authorities’ and taxpayers’ ways to control farming practices. This in turn reflects broader changes in human-nature, human-animal and human-human relationships, the rise of the environmental state and shifts in the institutional relations between the EU and its member states. 

By reconstructing the shifting theories of social control implicit in policy instruments, this research adds to previous understandings of post-exceptionalism in agri-food policies adding a more nuanced understanding of the location and the functioning of power relations in the CAP, and in policy mixes in general.",Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin,Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin,,,,,,,Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin,,Peter H.

0,"Digitalisation is one of the megatrends affecting many aspects of modern life and public policy all over the world. Previous findings (Kemmerling & Gast Zepeda, Forthcoming) suggest that in Germany, parliamentary speeches seem to have a rather narrow focus on infrastructure, data privacy and regulation, when discussing digitalisation. The way policymakers talk about digitalisation matters, as it reflects the way the digital transformation is shaped in Germany. The covid-19 pandemic has shed light on many shortcomings in the status quo of digitalisation in Germany, and consequently acted as a catalyst for digitalisation in many domains of private and public life. I aim to analyse how policymakers understand, approach and talk about digitalisation, and how this has changed since the covid-19 pandemic. To analyse parliamentary speeches that mention digitalisation, I rely on the Rauh & Schwalbach’s (2020) ParlSpeech V2 data set for 1991-2018 and scrape parliamentary speeches for 2019-2022 from the Bundestag website. I combine a higher-resolution (i.e. micro) and a lower-resolution (i.e. macro) approach to categorise the concepts and contexts in which digitalisation is discussed in the German parliament. I start with the lower-resolution approach, for which I use a topic modelling approach based on Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) (Blei et al. 2003; Roberts et al. 2014). In the next stage, I perform a hierarchical cluster analysis to identify how (dis)similar topics are to one other. Based on the topic terms from the topic model, I derive categories of the contexts in which parliamentarians talk about digitalisation in their speeches. I draw a random sample of speeches from the corpus, which I then analyse individually: I identify what aspects of digitalisation and what areas of application those speeches touch on and which definitions, concepts or understandings of digitalisation they imply. I then compare those to the categories identified previously and further develop the categorisation where necessary and adequate. In a final step I track if and how the main categories and contexts in which digitalisation is discussed among policymakers has changed over time.","Willy Brandt School of Public Policy, Universität Erfurt",,,,,,,,"Willy Brandt School of Public Policy, Universität Erfurt",,Stephanie Gast Zepeda,,,,,,,,Stephanie Gast Zepeda,,Parliaments,Internet,Communication,Mixed Methods,Narratives,National Perspective,Big Data,Empirical,Understanding the approach towards Digitalisation in Policymaking in Germany,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65774&EventID=185
0,"Stakeholder engagement in the design and formulation of legislative proposals and public policies is a landmark of modern policymaking in advanced democracies. Stakeholder consultations are particularly relevant for non-elected institutions, such as executive bureaucracies, for which stakeholder engagement represents a unique opportunity to build input and throughput legitimacy and to gather (broad) public support for their proposed policies. When and how the constellation of different consultation mechanisms affects the levels of stakeholder support for legislative proposals constitutes a key theoretical and empirical puzzle that currently remains unaddressed in a systematic manner in the literature on stakeholder engagement in democratic policymaking. The study addresses this gap and focuses empirically on one of the most complex and institutionalized stakeholder consultation regimes: that implemented by the European Commission since 2016 when the European executive significantly expanded the scope and breath of stakeholder engagement across different stages of its policy formulation processes. The study examines the extent to which different consultation mechanisms (i.e., online consultations, feedback opportunities, etc.) employed when formulating European policies shape the levels of stakeholder support for draft legislative proposals across different policy areas. The study elaborates an argument explaining how institutional characteristics of consultation design, characteristics of stakeholder participation in consultations and key characteristics of policy areas contribute towards explaining the conditions under which public consultation mechanisms elicit varying levels of stakeholder support. This argument is tested on a new dataset recording information about stakeholder consultations and expressed support for 469 EC draft legislative proposals adopted during the 2016-2021.

0,"To enable robust and just sustainability transitions, we need to understand how social-ecological systems (SES) respond to different governance configurations, considering their historical, institutional, political and power conditions. Governance and politics are inherently implicated in any effort to foster successful transitions, with pluralism (of method and of reality) as a key ingredient for success. In this paper, we present a pluralistic methodology for the integrated analysis of those conditions, drawing on a partial synthesis of 15-years’ case study research in the Doñana estuary-delta SES (Guadalquivir estuary, SW Spain). Doñana is characterized by rigid water governance and, more generally, by a SES rigidity trap. The presented methodology consists of a novel combination of insights from resilience thinking, neo-institutionalism (rational-choice, historical and discursive), and the role of power. Through an illustrative example of a hydraulic megaproject, our synthesis reveals a governance configuration characterized by strategic interactions among key actors posing no systemic risks in the short term. However, this pattern is vulnerable due to an underlying coordination failure among actors. This situation emerge from a pattern of uncooperative behavior that cannot be explained without considering historical evolution, discursive-institutional inertia and power dynamics. We argue that Doñana might be on the verge of a regime shift to a lock-in trap posing high sunk and trajectory-shifting costs. However, there is a high potential from latent pluralism to challenge current discursive-institutional dynamics and from well-preserved natural values to govern for nature. This, we argue, could create a new baseline governance configuration more prone to nurture the conditions for a sustainability transition.",,Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona,,,,,,,Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas,,Floriane Clement,Sergio Villamayor-Tomas,,,,,,,Pablo F.

The dissertation scrutinizes the correlation between the level of democracy and democracy funding provided by the United Nations to state and non-state actors in the MENA region. This is conducted, first, by (1) examining the literature about the United Nations and its role in promoting democracy; (2) designing a mixed-methods research design using both qualitative and quantitative approaches; (3) identifying the extent to which the UN has a positive or a negative influence on democratization in the region. The trend in academic writing about the United Nations is to place emphasis on its efforts to advance international peace and provide economic and social assistance to the developing countries. Less is known about the role of the United Nations in democracy promotion, and in particular, there has not been much academic research that examines whether the UN’s democracy promotion strategies are effective.

0,"The question of what characterises the European public sphere, and whether one exists in the first place, has been a topic of flourishing academic debate for many years (Nicolaïdis, 2004; Risse, 2015; Zúñiga, 2015). Concomitant with the rise of social media such as Twitter and Facebook, the focus has shifted to exploring how social media can be used to construct a European public sphere that is fully transnational in nature (Bouza et al., 2019; Ruiz-Soler et al., 2019; Tuñón-Navarro and Carral-Vilar, 2021).	Our paper contributes to this literature by honing in on the issues of identity formation and ‘othering’ in the context of European integration: We investigate the extent to which two crises that will arguably come to shape the EU in the coming decades (migration crisis and covid-19 crisis) give rise to a shared discourse among English-language social media users in different countries, as well as whether there are large divergences in the frames adopted by English-language Twitter users and those generally addressing themselves to a national public sphere. It thus helps develop our understanding of the extent to which social media discourses can serve as the building blocks of a truly European public sphere, and by extension a European identity.
Using a topic modelling approach, we map the topics of German and Greek Twitter-sphere discourse surrounding the refugee crisis of 2015-2016 and the COVID-19 crisis of 2020-2021 (Blei and Lafferty, 2007), exploiting the multilingual nature of Twitter discourses in the two countries to investigate collective identity and othering both in domestic-language and English-language tweets in the two countries. Drawing on the rich literature on the transnationalisation of public spheres (e.g. Fraser, 2007; Habermas, 1999), we contribute timely empirical analysis to the question of whether the EU’s decade of crises (Gänzle et al., 2019) have given rise to a de-differentiated public sphere, whereby Europeans use social media to debate the same topics while applying the same frames of reference, or if social media instead serves as an amplifier of national discourses and debates.",Universitetet i Oslo,Universitetet i Oslo,,,,,,,Universitetet i Oslo,,Asimina Michailidou,Martin Moland,,,,,,,Asimina Michailidou,,European Politics,European Union,Media,Social Media,,,,,"United, we tweet: Belonging, solidarity and othering in German and Greek Twitter-spheres",https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64643&EventID=185

Yet, aligning concepts of resource system (RS) and resource unit (RU) with realities of individual case studies pose challenges if the underlying SES is not a single RS, but a larger nested RS (NRS). Using a diagnostic approach, we describe NRSs – observable in larger SESs - dependent upon activities and networks of adjacent action situations (NAAS) containing them. An NRS includes the larger RS and multiple interlinked semi-
autonomous subsidiary RSs, each of which support simultaneous, differently managed appropriation of individual RUs, adding ambiguity to the goods typology. NRSs bring about a subcategory of NAAS stemming from biophysical and social ties between different action situations.

0,"In unpacking competition among universities, academic institutions have become embedded in multiple types of nested and interdependent competitions (Marginson, 2006; Krücken, 2019). Despite these findings, there is a lack of knowledge on the initial mechanisms that enable the formation of (emergence) and give momentum to (diffusion and institutionalization) university competition as a phenomenon that has spread across fields, institutions, and basic academic units. In contrast, competition is often taken for granted or simply assumed to emerge. A few studies have discussed the initial processes and early institutionalization of competition within HE (Werron, 2015; Arora-Jonsson et. al., 2020), but even these studies have disregarded questions such as when (under what conditions) and why (drivers and rationales) academic institutions started to compete and how does competition become a part of the technical and institutional environments (forces of institutionalization) in which contemporary universities operate? 
To bridge this knowledge gap, we ask the following question: Why does competition among academic institutions emerge and how does it become an integrated part of an academic field? We take strategic management literature as our starting point, and pay close attention to actors, their relationships, and agency. Instead of directly explaining competition at the HE field level, we focus on university organizations and explore the preconditions and processes that motivate these actors to compete, and hence, to collectively produce the previously described competitive transformation in the HE field. On combining key contributions emanating from economics, business studies and HE research, we develop a set of generic propositions. Thus, the study seeks to unpack the taken-for-granted competitive discourse in the field of HE. Its main contribution is a novel explanation of why competition emerges among different HE actors and how it becomes the dominant lens through which individual HE institutions (HEIs) explore their identities, belongings, and relationships to other actors within the field. 2 

To focus on the origins and to illustrate the emergence of competition, we develop two case vignettes within specific university subfields in the selected empirical context, namely, business schools in Norway and Finland. We provide two brief, but easily relatable, narratives of the birth and early institutionalization of competition as experienced by the actors involved. After the case examples, one historical (Norway) and one contemporary (Finland), we provide theoretical explanations and draw from the extant literature to identify how various actors and their strategic agency and intentions, first, initiate, and second, aid in institutionalizing university competition across the board.",University of Agder,University of Agder,,,,,,,University of Agder,,Kerttu Kettunen,Romulo Pinheiro,,,,,,,Kimmo Alajoutsijärvi,,Governance,Institutions,Public Administration,Knowledge,Higher Education,Policy-Making,,,Unpacking institutional competition in Higher Education: The case of the Nordic business school field,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64523&EventID=185
0,"The connection between populism and Euroscepticism has been the focus of previous studies. For instance, Pirro & Taggart  (2018) refer to “the unexceptional overlap between populist and Eurosceptic politics” but of course they recognize that “not every Eurosceptic party is necessarily populist … and not every populist party is necessarily Eurosceptic” concluding that “there is no necessary convergence between populism and Euroscepticism”. Harmsen (2010) refers to other differences between the two concepts, e.g. that populism can be traced back to  the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries while Euroscepticism constitutes a more recent phenomenon that dates from the early 1990s and is of course, confined to Europe alone. 
However, as Harmsen (2010) argues, although euroscepticism is not a subset of populism, there may be a strong connection between them: “opposition to European integration has unquestionably been shaped by wider anti-elite discourses, and in turn has served to reshape these discourses – as well as the parties which deploy them”. In addition, focusing on Hungary and Poland Csehi and Zgut (2021) show that in Orbán’s and Kaczyński’s discourses “the EU is equated with ‘the corrupt elite’ that stands in conflict with ‘the pure people’, the Hungarians and Poles, and … the EU is claimed to act against the notion of popular sovereignty”. 
At the focus of the DATAPOPEU Research Project funded by the Hellenic Foundation for Research & Innovation is the interplay between populism and euroscepticism.

0,"This article aims to comprehend the legal/social construction of the safe third country (STC) concept as a bordering practice and deconstruct its implications on access to asylum (procedures). A great deal of literature analyzes the legality of this concept, of the associated returns, or of the safety criteria as per international law and EU law. However, the impact of this concept when used with informal agreements for its activation in third countries, particularly on access to asylum (procedures), remains to be underinvestigated. The article contextualizes this question in the context of the EU’s external borders, mainly in view of STC returns from the Greek hotspots to Turkey. The STC principle constructed by EU law in the last three decades has evolved into a bordering practice for excluding “irregular” migrants from protection in the EU. A combination of hard law, such as the recast Asylum Procedures Directive, and soft law, including the EU-Turkey Statement of March 2016 and the progress reports issued in the form of non-binding Communications by the Commission, produces a category of “inadmissible” migrants not eligible for asylum in the EU and incentivizes a trend of the return of migrants who do not fit in this category to a third country. Drawing on the qualitative analysis of these documents with perspectives from critical border studies, the article addresses how the STC concept in its current form leads to a mechanism that excludes the migrants in the Greek-Turkish context to asylum (procedures) in the EU, and overall, from being a “genuine” refugee.",University of Helsinki,,,,,,,,University of Helsinki,,Berfin Nur Osso,,,,,,,,Berfin Nur Osso,,European Union,Governance,Human Rights,Migration,Qualitative,Asylum,Empirical,Refugee,"Unpacking the Safe Third Country Concept in the European Union: B/Orders, Legal Spaces, and Asylum in the Shadow of Externalization",https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64511&EventID=185
0,"The policy tools of urban and regional planning (or ‘spatial planning’) are much more extensive than regulation alone, and include a wide range of policy tools that are available and used by governments in making, implementing and enforcing plans. Based on a conceptualisation of the policy tools of spatial planning by Dominic Stead (2021), the paper explores how this range of tools is used for climate mitigation purposes. More specifically, the paper studies how urban climate leadership, with ambitious climate goals (95% reduction by 2030) and innovative steering instruments like the climate budget, use a broad range of planning tools to reach their aim. It also analyses how urban climate leadership spurs innovation in spatial planning tools. The paper is based on a qualitative case study of the City of Oslo, which had the status of being the European Green Capital in 2019, and shows how existing and new spatial planning tools are developed to push private developers to implement more climate-friendly building projects. The analysis is based on document studies and qualitative interviews. Studies of front-runner cities in climate transition contribute to the research, as they provide new knowledge of and insights into what kind of governance innovation is needed for climate transition. This knowledge can be useful for the climate transition of other European cities.

0,"At the UNFCCC 26th Conference of Parties (COP), cities and regions of the world called all nations for multilevel collaboration action. Urban actors appealed to the collective responsibility in dealing with challenges related to climate change. How was it possible that subnational governments encourage nations for collaborative actions based on their understanding of collective responsibility and does that kind of understanding coincide with the perspective of states as the actors that bear primary responsibility in the UNFCCC regime?

For years, cities have been actively embraced by numerous UN treaties and mechanisms in dealing with climate change. Since 1995, cities raised their voices at COPs and their advocacy evolved. The recent COP26 in Glasgow included a global mayoral forum called the Multilevel Action Pavilion. It was held at the same, barrier-free area with the core COP and resulted in multiple official interventions with the main COP’ program. In addition, cities have gained a special status among non-state actors inside the UN system when global city networks left their representation at the ECOSOC and have become counterparts for thematic UN programs. Nowadays, the three largest global city networks, ICLEI, C40, and UCLG play the role of advisory bodies of particular UN’s structures dealing with climate change.

As illustrated above, the UN’s structures in the area of climate change have become highly interrelated with urban actors. Yet, the public position of the UN on cities’ role in tackling climate change remains to be cautious. The intergovernmental nature of the UN and the contestation of the global municipal movement against rigid climate change policies of national governments creates a significant tension. Therefore, the research question of the inquiry is the following: What does the appearance of a new actor mean for climate change? Is multilevel action including also subnational and local levels of governance a solution to orchestration of climate change action or a way to increased competition among involved actors? I argue that the UN’s structural interrelation with urban actors forms a new norm. The intentions of actors to influence the evolvement and meaning of this norm might cause a competition among all interested stakeholders.

The paper applies the methodology of constructivism in international relations to explain the transformation of climate change governance under the appearance of cities as a new actor. At first, the paper aims to understand the structural change of the UN’s agencies and programs related to climate change agenda. Secondly, it aims to analyze the accountability of cities in reports of major city networks. The applied methods include the qualitative content analysis of reports of three major city networks, ICLEI, UCLG, and C40 in the period 2005-2020 and semi-structured interviews with UN and cities’ representatives. The preliminary results provide evidence that the “urbanization” of the UN’s climate change processes goes in line with the growth of global accountability of cities. The detailed evaluation of the effects of these two processes on the UN’s climate change regime will be conceptualized in the final results of the study.",University of Bielefeld,,,,,,,,University of Bielefeld,,Tatiana Saraseko,,,,,,,,Tatiana Saraseko,,Governance,Local Government,UN,Constructivism,Global,Climate Change,,,Urban Governance of Climate Change within the United Nations: Orchestration or Competition?,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=66081&EventID=185
0,"Much ink has been spilled in the last 20 years – both in and outside the scholarly community – on the booming political and economic relationships between China and the countries of Latin America, two regions that prior to the turn of the century had limited interaction. The events of 2001 and 2008 were crucial for China's penetration into Latin America: in 2001, the downsizing of the US focus on the subcontinent because of the new terrorist threat was coupled with a growing Chinese interest in the region in the wake of Beijing's entry into the WTO. Seven years later, the financial crisis had made it necessary for the United States to focus on its domestic sphere, allowing Latin American countries to see in China a new window of opportunity that Washington could no longer guarantee. Chinese imports of food and agricultural products have since been matched by important financial interactions. While a substantial body of scholarly literature has emerged on both Latin American commodity export dependence and the determinants of the US and Chinese overseas foreign direct investment (OFDI), still little effort seems to have been made to systematically analyze how OFDI vary according to the different Latin American domestic regimes. While the broader objective of my study will aim to fill the research gap by analyzing US and Chinese FDI (1990-2020) in Chile and Bolivia – representative of diverging political economy trends –, with a focus on the mining sector, the present paper will focus on a proposal for reclassification of data on FDI.

0,"This paper focuses on the decline of partisanship at the municipal level in the Czech Republic. Independent candidates are playing an increasingly important role in local elections as elsewhere in Europe. At the same time, the Czech Republic has a very fragmented settlement structure. More than a quarter of municipalities have fewer than 200 inhabitants. In these municipalities councillors affiliated to a political party are rather the exception. 
The paper discusses at first the decline in the number of candidates representing a political party in local elections in the smallest municipalities. Several forms of political party involvement at the local level were identified, ranging from a stand-alone political party candidate list to an independent local list of candidates nominated by a political party but without party affiliation. Through an analysis of in-depth interviews with representatives of political parties and local authorities, the paper tries to find answers to questions such as: What role does a political party play now at the local level in the smallest municipalities? How has this role changed in recent years?

0,"Duverger's definition of a semi-presidential system as a political system where the president is elected by universal suffrage for a fixed term, has significant powers, and is sharing the executive with a prime minister who derive their legitimacy from majority support in Parliament. The concept of ""significant powers"" is wanting as it leaves the concept largely under-defined and therefore unmeasurable. One particularly vexing issue is that while some presidents in semi-presidential systems have expanded their powers beyond the bounds of constitutional texts, while others have not made use of those powers, and therefore reduced their potential political influence. This contribution aims at better understanding why these expansions and contractions of powers took place. It uses a historical institutionalist approach to examine cases of expansion (France), as well as contraction (Portugal), and argues that the genesis of the presidency in these different political systems has led to the establishment of a widely accepted and reinforcing understanding of what constraints should be placed on the president's powers.",St John Fisher College,,,,,,,,St John Fisher College,,Sébastien Lazardeux,,,,,,,,Sébastien Lazardeux,,Constitutions,European Politics,Executives,Institutions,Comparative Perspective,,,,Variations in the use of presidential powers in semi-presidential systems- a comparative analysis of France and Portugal,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=66119&EventID=185
0,"Do European member states free ride in allocating funds for defence purposes? Findings in the literature, particularly those regarding European NATO members, remain inconclusive. We argue that, methodologically, existing research has been insufficiently attentive to spatio-temporal dynamics, which can lead to biases. Considering the regional concentration of inter-governmental connectivity at the EU level, a broader security “web” of neighbouring EU member states and, specifically, their defence spending patterns allow for investigating the role of the regional context as a conditioning influence (Allen et al. 2017). Basing our analysis on the STADL (Spatio-Temporal Autoregressive Distributed Lag) model proposed by Cook et al. (2021), we submit that our contribution is mainly threefold. First, we take care of both spatial and temporal correlation. Second, we accurately derive direct and indirect effects – another aspect that has been largely neglected in the existing literature. Last but not least, we present a range of important mechanisms which could capture different dimensions of free-riding. Apart from the spatial effect of other members’ spending and that of US expenditure, we also look at the influence of US troop presence and Russian military expenditure. Furthermore, we investigate whether these patterns diverge between members and non-members of NATO. We uncover heterogeneous influences that either encourage EU member states to free ride or restrain this type of behavior, which suggests implications for EU/European strategic autonomy in the defence field.",Vilnius University,General Jonas Žemaitis Military Academy of Lithuania,,,,,,,General Jonas Žemaitis Military Academy of Lithuania,,Vytautas Kuokstis,Ringailė Kuokštytė,,,,,,,Ringailė Kuokštytė,,European Union,NATO,Security,Member States,,,,,Varieties of European Military Freeriding,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65750&EventID=185
0,"It is often argued that democracy is increasingly taking on a hybrid form. Therein, the representative part is complemented with participatory mechanisms and practices. This holds in particular at the level allegedly closest to the citizens. Local authorities have realized that they can no longer solve various complex problems on their own. Therefore, other actors, such as citizens and civil society, are given wider and deeper opportunities to participate in the policy-making process. This phenomenon is also present in local politics in Flanders (Belgium), the context of our research. 
Our study takes the hitherto understudied perspective of local executive politicians, as crucial stakeholders spanning representative and participatory democracy. It aims to examine how to assess the attitudes of these executives towards different participatory arrangements. 
The research was conducted by means of a large-scale survey-experiment among mayors and aldermen. The study used a vignette that focused on a redevelopment case of a municipal building. This vignette was followed by different ways to decide upon the case. First, there was an arrangement with a classic representative model in which the local authority took the initiative and decided (baseline condition). Furthermore, six participatory arrangements were included varying on two important dimensions. To introduce these six participatory arrangements to the respondents, we employed a mixed-factorial design in which we included two different types of initiator (government vs. citizens) as the between-groups factor and three different types of citizen involvement (consultative vs. co-productive and vs. (co-)decisive arrangements) as the within-subjects (repeated measures) factor. During the survey-experiment, respondents were always first presented the baseline condition (classic scenario), which was followed by three participatory arrangements (which were either government- or citizen-initiated). The order in which these three participatory arrangements were presented to participants was randomized.
In order to let respondents assess the different arrangements, statements were offered to determine how legitimate and favorable perceived the different arrangements (outcome variables). These statements have been formulated around the perceived input, throughput and output legitimacy of the arrangements. In addition to the various scenarios and legitimacy assessments, this study also addressed a number of potential moderating variables. These variables can be grouped into three categories: municipality (e.g. population density), party (e.g. party membership) and individual level (e.g. ideological self-orientation). This will help to determine the contingencies of participatory attitudes. Furthermore, the study is part of an interdisciplinary project that focuses on four key local actors. This allows us to compare our insights with similar findings for other executive actors such as local administrators.",Ghent University,Ghent University,Ghent University,Ghent University,,,,,Ghent University,,Willem Goutry,Kristof Steyvers,Bram Verschuere,Tessa Haesevoets,,,,,Willem Goutry,,Democracy,Local Government,Political Engagement,,,,,,Varieties of local participation: a large-scale survey-experiment on how executive politicians perceive the legitimacy of different participatory arrangements,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64214&EventID=185
0,"It is widely argued that states’ Command-and-Control regulation is a burdensome, inefficient, ineffective and illiberal mechanism for regulating market actors. In recent decades, many efforts have been made to find alternatives regimes that could ensure the public interest in a less costly, less legalistic and punitive and less centralized manner. However, it is still unclear how such alternative and “smarter” regimes affect citizens' trust in market actors. Using two experimental surveys with representative samples of the Israeli population (n=1195), we examine the extent to which nine different regulatory regimes influence citizens' willingness to trust a hypothetical Fintech company that requires clients to trust it with their private financial data. The results show that public trust in market entities increases with the existence of a state regulator and decreases under self-regulatory regimes. Hybrid regimes in which a state regulator relies on pledges instead of strict oversight can increase trust, provided that the regulator is perceived as trustworthy. It follows that governmental C&C regulation can be beneficial to both the public and firms and that more regulation may mean more trust in the market.",Hebrew University of Jerusalem,Hebrew University of Jerusalem,,,,,,,Hebrew University of Jerusalem,,Libby Maman,David Levi Faur,,,,,,,Libby Maman,,Governance,Government,Regulation,Business,,,,,Varieties of Regulatory Regimes and their Effect on Public Trust in Market Actors,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=66102&EventID=185
0,"Multilevel government is often thought to hamper electoral accountability because it blurs lines of responsibility between levels of government. This assumption has been only sporadically investigated in a limited set of elections using single country or single region studies. Our paper provides the most comprehensive test of the multilevel economic voting model by simultaneously utilizing 410 regional election surveys (pre electoral and post electoral) from 41 regions in 4 European countries. The unique and rich data enables us to test several important implications of the multilevel economic voter. First, we test the extent to which voters base their vote choice on their perceptions of the national economy relative to the regional economy. Instead of conceiving regional elections as either second-order or not, we are able assess the extent to which regional elections are seen by voters as second-order elections compared to first-order, national elections. Second, we are able to investigate what drives the varying levels of multilevel economic voting in regional elections. We hypothesize that regional authority, the electoral system, the party system, and parliamentary-executive relations in the regions are important drivers of the extent of regional voting. Due to the heterogeneity of the data across the surveys used in this study, we combine two different research strategies, i.e., weighted pooled effect size approach and multilevel fixed effects modelling. This study has important implications for our understanding of voter behaviour in multilevel electoral systems as well as of the (multilevel) economic voter.

0,"From 1900 to 1927, there was a scientific revolution which broke the classical model and its postulates on truth and objectivity. The pattern for everything–science, the state, and society, our deepest assumptions about space and time, the world in general, matter and causality, from the separation between subject and object to determinism–was swept away by what, somewhat ironically, came to be known as the modern model. However, the new paradigm encountered enormous difficulties to go beyond the sphere of physics, including going to political theory. 
The opportunity it provided to revisit key elements of the first modern wave, glistening with humanist rhetoric, through a broad cosmovision that included political and philosophical spheres, languished for decades. Today, when interdisciplinarity urges us to adopt the current scientific paradigm in all sciences to better face the challenges of our times, we can return to the works of Giambattista Vico who, from the very beginning of Modernity, defended an integrating path for science.
In this paper I will explore the possible relations between Vico’s proposal and the principles of the new science that emerged from the 20th century scientific revolution. From the rhetorical notion of verisimilitude, ars topica, and loyalty to the experiment, from the importance given to phantasy, contingency, and metaphor, Vichian rhetoric provides a sensibility capable of recognising the riches and limitations of the human in our scientific task of understanding reality. In addition to the basic contemporary perspective, I am primarily guided in this task by the later reflections of Erwin Schrödinger, the pioneering scientist who seems closest to Vico, and by the retrospective philosophical work of Werner Heisenberg in the 1950s.
From this endeavour a political theory will emerge that, quite unlike the heirs of Ramism and the Cartesian method, is capable of being consistent with the current scientific paradigm and is still able to pursue a science based on common sense, understanding, tacit knowledge, and vision, as much of contemporary political theorists has been asking for since the mid-twentieth century in their dialogue with empirical political scientists.",Universidad Complutense de Madrid,,,,,,,,Universidad Complutense de Madrid,,Víctor Alonso-Rocafort,,,,,,,,Víctor Alonso-Rocafort,,Political Theory,Knowledge,Constructivism,Methods,,,,,"Vichian Rhetoric and Contemporary Science, an Old New Path for Political Theory",https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64404&EventID=185
0,"‘Viral lobbying’, that is, interest group politics during the COVID-19 pandemic, is both an important case in itself, as well as an insightful context to study the dynamics of how organised interests impact policy responses after an external shock and in radically altered circumstances. Pandemic politics in the COVID-19 crisis can be seen as a system-wide focusing event (Sabatier 1988; Kingdon 1995; Birkland 1998), which requires immediate and far-reaching responses by all political actors. Our analyses cover several relevant analytical levels to understand ‘viral lobbying’. From an organisational perspective, it is important to address how individual interest organisations adapted to the challenges posed by the global health crisis. At the same time, it is important to study, at the system-level, whether the political and interest group system is resilient to the massive disruptions posed by the pandemic. Finally, at both the organisation and system-level, a crucial question is how the resulting patterns in actual policy influence are distributed – for instance between types of organisations (economic and non-economic groups) and different sectors. To answer such pivotal questions, we trace the influence production process, which analyses interest group mobilisation, strategies and interactions with policymakers to link them to impact on policy outcomes (Lowery and Gray 2004; Mahoney 2008; Baumgartner et al. 2009; Dür and Mateo, 2016). In particular, our emphasis is on the advocacy stages of mobilisation, strategy selection, access and influence. We rely on data collected in two survey waves in seven European polities from more than 1,600 interest groups. 

More specifically, starting with the analysis of mobilisation patterns, we differentiate between organisations who mobilised after the outbreak of COVID-19 and those who, instead, were not able to do so because of the disruption caused by the pandemic. Among those who mobilised politically, we explore which strategies were selected and how organisations adapted their strategies to the new circumstances. Subsequently, we link the use of strategies to their political effects. We do this, firstly, by analysing patterns in political access, that is, the organisations’ interactions with political actors in key venues of policymaking. Secondly, we assess to which extent lobbying during the pandemic plausibly influenced the resulting public policies by focussing on differences between more and less influential organisations. In this way, we aim to evaluate the implications of the COVID-19 pandemic for lobbying communities in Europe, by attending to the above stages of the influence production process applied to lobbying on COVID-19 related policies.",Queen's University Belfast,University of Copenhagen,University of Amsterdam,University of Amsterdam,,,,,Queen's University Belfast,,Michele Crepaz,Wiebke Marie Junk,Marcel Hanegraaff,Joost Berkhout,,,,,Michele Crepaz,,Comparative Politics,Interest Groups,Public Policy,Quantitative,Lobbying,Policy Change,Survey Research,Influence,"Viral Lobbying: Strategies, Access and Influence during the COVID-19 Pandemic",https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63919&EventID=185
0,"What is the role of a research design in reproducing or overcoming epistemic injustices? As researchers attempt to make sense of processes on the ground, their interpretations are inevitably shaped by epistemological and ontological traditions embedded in their research designs. In this article, we identify the aspects of research designs that allow to recognize or conversely overlook the vulnerabilities on which the social life of research participants, particularly marginalized groups, depends. To build this argument, we first depart from an understanding of vulnerability as an interdependent human condition which allows us to recognize interdependencies as an integral part of any research project. This perspective permits us to approach vulnerability as contextual, co-constructed, and taking shape within the many social and political interdependencies that govern the daily lives of individuals. Second, we analyse what role research designs play in addressing these interdependencies. Building on the concepts of dominant narratives and epistemic injustice, we argue that based on whether a research design allows for a space to address the interdependencies between marginalized groups and dominant narratives, epistemic injustice is either tackled or reproduced. As a result, we propose facets of a research design one needs to consider in order to prevent epistemic injustices and advance alternative narratives. We illustrate our argument by reviewing existing research on marginalized groups and provide methodological tools to conduct a research sensitive to vulnerability.",European University Institute,European University Institute,,,,,,,European University Institute,,Ophelia Nicole-Berva,Anete Ušča,,,,,,,Ophelia Nicole-Berva,,Knowledge,Methods,Ethics,Narratives,Theoretical,,,,Visible Interdependencies: Tools for Epistemic Justice in Research Designs,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65037&EventID=185
0,"The proposed paper will analyse the temporal structure that is running through political narratives about the future in order to carve out their authoritarian characteristics. More specifically, it will examine the notions of decay and apocalypse that motivate extremist actors on the transnational far right across Western countries to overcome democratic institutions and engage in political violence. Expanding on literature that analyses these narratives as conspiracy theories, it shifts our analytical gaze to an aspect that can further our understanding of their link to the contestation of political orders - while acknowledging their rootedness in particular knowledge orders.

Theoretically, it will rely on literature on social imaginaries (Taylor, 2004; Anderson, 1983; Appadurai, 2013; Jasanoff & Kim, 2015), but tie them more closely to conceptions of the future (Beckert, 2016) and sociology of time (Rosa, 2017). Besides embedding empirical findings on extremist movements in a wider sociological framework of late modern temporal structures, this angle allows us to investigate different national narratives – that can be understood as variations of the same theme – in conjunction as parts of a transnational imaginary. 

Empirically, it will engage with the transnationalised future imaginary of the far right in the West that is reflected in narratives such as the ‘grand remplacement’, the ‘Umvolkung’, or the ‘white genocide’. To this end, the paper will analyse several right-wing extremist manifestos that were published surrounding so-called ‘lone wolf’ attacks in several different Western countries with regards to their temporal structure.",WZB Berlin Social Science Center,,,,,,,,WZB Berlin Social Science Center,,Maximilian Weckemann,,,,,,,,Maximilian Weckemann,,Extremism,Political Violence,Terrorism,Mobilisation,Narratives,,,,Visions of division: the temporal structure of far-right narratives on the future,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65945&EventID=185
0,"Turkey’s Western-oriented foreign policy trajectory and its national identity have experienced a neo-Ottomanist shift following the Syrian refugee crisis. The political tension between the EU and Turkey regarding the management of the massive migration from Syria has become a turning point for Turkey where the Turkish identity was reframed as the “savior” of Muslims by bringing the neo-Ottomanist elements back into foreign policy discourses. However, this shift in the identity was not only limited to official foreign policy discourses but the same theme has been observed at different political sites from domestic politics to cultural production. While the representation of “Turkishness” has gained a retrospect due to the neo-Ottoman turn at the foreign policy level, the cultural production site has become a site of contestation for Turkish identity. The massive amount of Ottoman-themed TV shows and the financial and moral support of the current Turkish government for these productions have turned the cultural production site into a site of contestation for Turkish identity. By drawing on the literature on the aesthetic turn in IR and visual politics, this paper aims to explore the role of visual practices in the identity-building process in times of crisis. While exploring the suitable theoretical approaches, this paper engages with the empirical case of Turkey and presents visual illustrations and their analysis regarding the Turkish identity representations that take part in Turkish TV shows after 2011.",Central European University,,,,,,,,Central European University,,Ceren Çetinkaya,,,,,,,,Ceren Çetinkaya,,Foreign Policy,Identity,Qualitative,Television,Euroscepticism,,,,Visual Politics of Neo-Ottomanism: A Critical Approach to the Identity Representations of Turkishness after the Syrian Refugee Crisis,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65717&EventID=185
0,"In many different fields, decision making is supported by software systems that facilitate a particular choice process. This can be management decisions in public as well as private organizations, but also those in other areas. Arguably, one of the most widely used decision support systems are so-called Voting Advice Applications (VAA), which enable citizens to find out which political party or candidate provides the best match in an upcoming election. The basic idea behind such tools is not only to aid the decision making, but also to facilitate a learning process. Via the interaction with the system’s interface, citizens can learn about the policy positions that parties or candidates take on a wide range of policy issues and how these add up to an overall level of matching. In countries with a multi-party system, in practice sometimes almost half of the voters use one or more of these tools. This paper analyses the different visualisations that these decision support systems use and how they affect the learning process and decision making. More specifically, we compare the three most popular visualisation types (bar chart, two-dimensional space, and spider diagram) and assess to what extent they help citizens to learn which party provides the best match and influence their decision making. We do so by embedding a vignette experiment in a survey about political preferences. The analyses suggest that citizens do indeed learn from such tools and subsequently let this information influence their decision making. The paper ends by discussing the implications for the future design of these tools.",Universiteit Twente,Universiteit Twente,,,,,,,Universiteit Twente,,Laura Harks,Martin Rosema,,,,,,,Martin Rosema,,Elections,Political Parties,Internet,Education,Electoral Behaviour,Experimental Design,Voting Behaviour,,Visualisations in Voting Advice Applications and Their Effects: A Vignette Experiment,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64046&EventID=185
0,"In December 2020, 5 percent of the German population reported they have no trust in the correct procedure of elections in Germany. 28 percent agreed with the statement: The political climate in Germany is different to what the election results tell us. Literature shows that voter fraud beliefs correlate highly with conspiracy beliefs and mistrust in political institutions in general. But most research related to perceived voter fraud focusses on the US or authoritarian regimes like Russia, where possible voter fraud is a public issue. In 2021, conspiracies related to the Covid-19 pandemic led to protest against the measures to fight the pandemic. After a peak in 2020, trust in politics declined in 2021, as the pandemic was ongoing. In the 2021 Federal Election, the share of postal voters was higher than ever before. Nevertheless, a public debate about postal voting, the consequences for an election in times of pandemic and election fraud, as in the US Presidential Election, did not unfold in Germany. This in contrast with the reported survey results from December 2020, raising the question of whether the observed mistrust in the election process is simply a survey artefact not related to the voting procedure itself—or if there is a stable proportion of people who share these attitudes but were not visible, as the public discussion in the aftermath of the Federal Election did not take place? By answering that question, I add to the literature of voter fraud beliefs in established democracies and link it to the underdeveloped field of postal voting in Germany. Specifically, I show how postal voters and election day voters differ in their attitudes concerning voter fraud, using panel data collected before and after the Federal Election in 2021 in Germany for the project: “Wahlen in stürmischen Zeiten.

0,"Despite the prevalent perception that “class is dead”, current scholarship consistently documents the continued existence of large class-based differences in social outcomes. Likewise, studies of electoral behaviour continue to find class differences in party choice just as political parties continue to appeal to social classes in their rhetoric – although less so than decades ago. Recent research has shown such class appeals – particularly to the working class – to be effective in attracting sympathy and increasing the propensity of votes across broad swathes of the electorate, i.e. not only among the working class. But how do such effects come about? What do voters infer from parties’ class rhetoric? To address these questions, thereby improving our understanding of the mechanisms behind group based political rhetoric, the paper investigates voters’ reactions to appeals to the working class or the upper middle class using responses to open-ended questions about voters’ thinking. The questions were embedded in an experimental survey of a representative sample of Danish voters and were hand coded across a range of parameters. The results show that voters generally accept class based rhetoric and connect it to issues of inequality. Furthermore, voters’ reaction to parties’ class appeals are conditioned by their interpretation of the appeals with stronger, and more emotional, effects observed among those whose reasoning is based on the groups involved. Finally, while the analyses show that voters harbour perceptions of parties’ traditional class alliances, they also document that such perceptions do not undercut the effectiveness of the appeals themselves. In other words: also parties not traditionally aligned with the working class can use appeals to that class to increase their standing in the electorate. The results thereby advance our understanding of the role of social groups in parties’ competition for votes.",Aarhus Universitet,,,,,,,,Aarhus Universitet,,Rune Stubager,,,,,,,,Rune Stubager,,Political Competition,Political Parties,Identity,Communication,Electoral Behaviour,Survey Experiments,Voting Behaviour,,Voter interpretation of parties’ class cues,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63992&EventID=185
0,"Much work on party strategy assumes that voters will reward particular issue stances with their ballot. Vice versa, much work on voting behavior assumes that parties’ issue stances are designed with vote maximization in mind. We integrate these assumptions into one dynamic model: Parties first strive to emphasize certain policy issues according to their potential to attract new voters while defending existing support—the strategic sweet spot described by “Issue Yield” theory. Among voters, sensitive to such issue priming, these issues acquire higher salience as criteria orienting the voting decision. As a result, the electoral return on effective Issue Yield strategy will manifest itself in a competitive tilt toward the winning party. Overall, we expect vote switching to occur when there is a disparity in the degree to which parties pursue their Yield. We test these hypotheses using data from the Issue Competition Comparative Project, which combines seven pre/post-election voter surveys from Europe and the US with systematic codings of parties’ Twitter campaigns.",LUISS University,LUISS University,European University Institute,City University of New York,,,,,LUISS University,,Davide Angelucci,Lorenzo De Sio,Mark Franklin,Till Weber,,,,,Davide Angelucci,,Elections,Political Competition,Political Parties,Comparative Perspective,Electoral Behaviour,Public Opinion,Voting Behaviour,,Voter Reactions to Issue Strategy: The Path from Yield to Return,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64160&EventID=185
0,"Citizens are increasingly confronted with data-driven campaigning strategies by European political parties on social media (Bene & Kruschinski, 2021). Examples include targeting political information such as tailored online ads to groups of citizens. Therefore, data-driven political advertising (henceforth DDPA) has received much attention from scholars. Despite this attention, we lack empirical findings on the role of voters in data-driven election campaigns. So far, research has shown that citizens lack understanding of data-driven strategies by companies (Gagrčin et al., 2021). More specifically, as scholars presented at the IJPP conference 2021, voters lack understanding of DDPA (Minihold et al, 2021). This is problematic because this lack of understanding likely affects the assessment of positive as well as negative real-life implications of DDPA. An example would be that certain voters would (not) receive certain campaign ad information, which is against their right to information (Bayer, 2021), and could subsequently matter for their potential political behavior adaptation.
This study brings voters even more into focus by not only investigating their understanding of DDPA, but also answering the plea of persuasion knowledge scholars to incorporate their evaluation of (data-driven) personalization strategies (Boerman et al., 2018; Rozendaal et al., 2016). This paper addresses these research gaps by offering 1) an exploration of what predicts voters’ conceptual understanding, as well as their evaluative perceptions of DDPA, and 2) investigates to what extent both the conceptual understanding, as well as the evaluative perception of DDPA affect data-driven political campaign engagement, and avoidance.
Our research relies on data from a multi-wave panel survey study conducted during the German Federal Election in August and September 2021(NW1= 1914, NW3 = 1303). Results indicate that the conceptual understanding of DDPA is related to the evaluative perceptions of DDPA. In other words, understanding data-driven tactics and strategies of political actors matter for the (dis)liking of DDPA, and vice versa. Furthermore, the findings suggest that conceptual understanding of DDPA matters for engaging with political campaign ads, but is not related to the avoidance of campaign ads. However, we find that evaluative perceptions of DDPA are negatively related to ad avoidance. This finding suggests that a negative evaluation of DDPA, such as perceiving DDPA as creepy, is related to actively avoiding data-driven campaign ads.

With this paper, we contribute to a long-neglected discourse about voter agency and empowerment in increasingly digital campaign practices and democratic governance. Our findings imply that understanding and evaluating data-driven campaigning techniques and implications matter for voters’ campaign (dis)engagement. These findings are important for the voters’ role in participatory democracies, which are challenged by an increased (political) information asymmetry, which is fuelled by data-driven campaigning. Our study thereby directly informs future studies dealing with increasing voter agency in data-driven campaigns, and it can bring crucial findings for political campaigners and digital literacy initiatives aiming to empower voters in an online-environment, alike.",University of Amsterdam,University of Manchester,University of Amsterdam,University of Vienna,University of Vienna,,,,University of Vienna,,Claes De Vreese,Rachel Gibson,Sanne Kruikemeier,Sophie Lecheler,Sophie Minihold,,,,Sophie Minihold,,Democracy,Elections,Advertising,Campaign,Social Media,Survey Research,,,Voters’ understanding and evaluation of data-driven political advertising,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65346&EventID=185
0,"The rich literature on the ethics of voting is mostly focused on the moral issues that voters face in democracies. However, elections are not held exclusively in democracies. This raises the question as to how far can we generalize the findings of an ethics of voting in democratic elections to other electoral contexts. In this paper, I argue that so-called hybrid regimes present voters with some unique moral challenges that voters in democracies do not face, and some forms of voting as a unique form of resistance to such regimes. Hybrid regimes are characterized by a restricted system of political rights or the severely diminished value of political rights. This makes voting a unique—even if imperfect—means for expressing resistance within and to such a regime. At the same time, hybrid regimes may turn into full-blown autocracies or turn back into democracies through elections—which generates special considerations that voters may and should take into account in resolving their moral dilemmas in such regimes.",Eötvös Loránd University,,,,,,,,Eötvös Loránd University,,Attila Mraz,,,,,,,,Attila Mraz,,Democracy,Democratisation,Elections,Political Participation,Political Theory,Voting,Ethics,Political Regime,Voting as an Act of Resistance in Hybrid Regimes,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65193&EventID=185
0,"Measuring populist attitudes became an expanding field focusing both on the demand and supply sides and trying to capture support for populist parties. In the literature there are different conceptualizations of what is the content and dimensionality of populist attitudes. According to the widely applied ideational approach to populism (Mudde 2004; Stanley 2008) core elements of populism are a) praise of the people /peoples’ value; b) anti-establishment /anti-elite feelings; c) Manichaean outlook on politics (Hawkins et al., 2012; Castanho Silva et al., 2019, Van Hauwaert et al. 2019). 
To challenge the operationalization of populist attitudes this study makes use of the CSES Module 5, post-election survey dataset for Slovakia 2020. Module 5 contains batteries of questions to measure populist attitudes defined as a “triangle” of following components: a) political elites and electoral process (anti-elitism); b) out-groups perception (foreigners, minorities etc.) and c) we the people (nationalism) dimensions (Hobolt et al., 2016). To our opinion this concept is heavily based on the academic notion of the populist radical right, which is defined as a combination of nativism, authoritarianism and populism in the ideological core of the party appeals (Mudde 2007).  The survey, however does not properly cover populism as thin-centered ideology, or, more exactly, equates it with the general anti-elitism. Yet, the Module 5 still provides a wealth of data regarding “populism” as it is often treated in the broad sense – as a radical challenge – or, better, a set of radical challenge(r)s to liberal democracy. It also enables to analyze the radical political attitudes of respondents on the individual level.  So, the study will identify if and how are nativism, authoritarianism, and populism distributed among Slovak electorate and its various relevant subgroups. These will include – but will not be limited – the constituencies of the major political parties. Except for the occurrence and distribution of the radical and challenger political persuasions, analysis will include the extent to which these attitudes are consistent with the vote choice. 
The secondary objective of the study will be to assess the potential of CSES survey to measure populism among the Slovak electorate. The conclusions will be applied on relevant aspects of the ISSP pretest (Slovakia´s part) and could offer methodological feedback on operationalisation of populist attitudes before the application of the ISSP survey in 2023.","Faculty of Social and Economic Sciences, Comenius University","Impacful, s.r.o.

0,"While scholarship on ethics of fieldwork research in authoritarian regimes is well established, little has been written on the topic in the context of democratic backsliding. This paper aims to address this lacuna by looking at the case of contemporary Hong Kong, where the government passed a new National Security Law (NSL) in 2020. The NSL, introduced in response to the 2019 popular protests in the city, is criticized for its vagueness and undermining the foundations of a democratic system such as the rule of law and freedom of speech and assembly. Consequently, the law heralds a state of judicial ambiguity amid socio-political transformations where there are no red lines, only grey zones. Navigating these grey zones therefore presents a researcher with a set of challenges different to when working in established democratic or authoritarian regimes. In order to sufficiently fulfil the ethical obligations of fieldwork research in such an unstable socio-political environment, this paper proposes an approach to fieldwork research that considers fieldwork research as inherently vulnerable. Vulnerability is therefore considered as an ongoing situational process rather than a static condition. Drawing on original fieldwork research on Hong Kong national identity conducted in 2021, the paper offers a critical evaluation of vulnerabilities arising from conducting fieldwork research amid democratic backsliding. In do so, it proposes a set of recommendations as to how to address such vulnerabilities prior, during and after fieldwork – while maintaining the rigor and integrity of the research process.",European University Institute,,,,,,,,European University Institute,,Mariusz Bogacki,,,,,,,,Mariusz Bogacki,,China,Democracy,National Identity,Methods,Qualitative,,,,Vulnerable Field(work) amid Democratic Backsliding: The Case of Hong Kong,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65038&EventID=185
0,"Other papers reveal different patterns of tolerance and intolerance against populists. The often-mixed reactions reflect uncertainty on the questions of whether populists deserve toleration or/and whether toleration is prudent. Practices of toleration imply no intention to curtail the rights of populists, no political ostracism and no coercive confrontation with them in the streets. Populists are subjected to standard legal rules, they are included political arena on the same conditions as everyone else, and treated as opponents rather than enemies, and the possibility of political collaboration is kept open. Intolerance is conceived as the opposite: curtailment of rights, state surveillance and ostracism. Based on case study examples, this article discusses the justifiability of practices in the border region between practices of tolerance and intolerance: public shaming and ridicule, and the strategic employment of civil and political rights to reduce the influence and power of populists, for example strikes and boycotts. It argues that these practices are generally justified because political toleration only emerges from serious disagreement about public institutions and policies and that rights are instruments that individuals are given to pursue their important interests within the limits of respecting other people’s rights.",Aarhus Universitet,,,,,,,,Aarhus Universitet,,Tore Vincents Olsen,,,,,,,,Tore Vincents Olsen,,Democracy,Political Theory,Populism,,,,,,Walking the line between tolerance and intolerance: citizens’ responses to populists,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64454&EventID=185
0,"Amidst the current developments indicating the ""return of geopolitics"" – especially the consistent growth of China in various critical political dimensions and the strong reaction of its government and that of Russia to Western/American expansionism in Eastern Europe or its presence in Eastern Asia –, a clear remolding of American political-strategic culture has increasingly become evident. American politics has long considered realism an unwelcome narrative of international politics. With the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the end-of-history unipolar hype, realism became harmless in the eyes of the American foreign policy elite and less relevant to the public debate consequently. Liberal internationalist foreign policies became quasi-consensual in Washington, while liberal approaches in the American/global IR discipline research rose to prominence against the prior traditional domination of realists. However, in the post-2008 crisis, as realist critics have pointed out the signs of the security dilemma's return, post-Cold War orthodoxy in American foreign policy has grown ferocious. First, there was the insistence on Barack Obama's un-Americaness in his relativization of exceptionalism. Then, the prompt dismissal of Donald Trump's foreign policy as mere isolationism or bad miscalculation flowing from an aggressive temper. With Joe Biden's election, renewed hope for another round of Wilsonianism seemed to be disappointed by his early implementation of the military withdrawal from Afghanistan – previously set forth by Obama and further defined by Trump – annoyed fellow liberals. It gave signs of favoring accommodation to the broader trends in world politics over exceptionalism in foreign affairs. Nevertheless, Biden's primetime with liberal internationalists would come in the opportunity laid by Russian aggression on Ukraine. That meant realists were to taste unsavory days ahead. This paper aims at the phenomenon of anti-realism in American foreign policy. In specific terms, it will do so by studying the public interactions between realist analysts that have positioned themselves critically against the almost direct involvement of the US in the war in Ukraine and their critics, denouncing unwanted support for Putin's cause. How does the myth of anti-realism in America live on in the face of an exhausting unilateral moment extended in ideational inertia? Despite the higher incidence of works pointing to a neglected genuine American realist tradition (and not simply the neorealist systemic given constraint), evidence and argument suggest that anti-realism has gained new momentum in public opinion. With a reactionary movement that echoes in the history of media behavior during national crises, liberal internationalists' mobilized significantly broader attention within the dynamics of social media and ""culture wars"" and ""canceling"" realist critics on the way.",Centro Universitário de Brasília (CEUB),,,,,,,,Centro Universitário de Brasília (CEUB),,Frederico Dias,,,,,,,,Frederico Dias,,Foreign Policy,International Relations,Security,USA,International,Realism,Theoretical,,War in Ukraine and anti-realism on American foreign policy,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65532&EventID=185
0,"The experiences of Joice Mujuru, one of the most accomplished woman politicians in Zimbabwe, demonstrate that dominant sites of meaning production play a significant role in influencing women’s ability to claim political legitimacy. At the height of her career, Joice Mujuru was touted as an exceptional liberation war hero in the dominant state-controlled media. Her image as a liberation war hero enabled her to claim political legitimacy because the ruling party and its leaders mainly justify their political authority by emphasising their roles in liberating Zimbabwe from colonial rule. She climbed up the hierarchical structures within the ruling ZANU-PF party and government until she was potentially next in line to become the country’s president. However, in 2014 she was accused of plotting to topple the then-president, Robert Mugabe, and was expelled from the party and fired from her position as the country’s vice president. The state-controlled media then claimed that her much-publicized liberation war exploits were mainly fictional, especially her widely acclaimed shooting of an enemy helicopter during the liberation war. Her political ascent was then primarily attributed to her sexual relationships with powerful men like her late husband, Solomon Mujuru. In defending herself from this onslaught, Joice Mujuru could only use social media platforms, independent media, and media platforms outside Zimbabwe. This paper focuses on the post-2014 period and combines a cultural studies approach, a political economy approach and curious feminism to explore Mujuru’s struggle to reclaim her political legitimacy. The cultural studies approach deconstructs texts to strip away the taken-for-grantedness of meaning. The political economy approach focuses on how power dynamics influence how people construct meanings within a productive process. Combining cultural studies and political economy approaches helps to incorporate a critical review that embeds texts within their context of production. Curious feminism adds to this the questioning of constructions of masculinised and feminised meanings in order to move away from considering the status quo as ‘common sense’. I pay attention to the intersection of patriarchal oppression and women’s resistance in the war of symbols, that is, the struggles over meaning production, to provide a more complex view of women’s struggle for political legitimacy. I argue that, although alternative media platforms that are outside the control of the state or that exist on the margins of political power may sometimes be effective in disseminating political messages, they may not be as effective for women whose gender places them in precarious positions within national politics where they lack access to robust media networks that will vigorously support their political interests and push their political agendas to the broader population.",Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies,,,,,,,,Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies,,Norita Mdege,,,,,,,,Norita Mdege,,Africa,Gender,Media,Feminism,Social Media,Communication,Influence,,War of Symbols and the Struggle for Political Legitimacy: The Case of Joice Mujuru,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=66067&EventID=185
0,"Language is not simply descriptive of social reality, it also constructs reality. The effects of language in shaping our perception and views are subtle, as language operates largely unconsciously. As such, language is an effective tool for manipulating political messages. Politicians can use language strategically, by carefully constructing sentences and choosing from a range of rhetorical means that can attract attention and reinforce the argumentation of the speaker. Language can also help in making extreme messages sound more appealing to broader audiences. Despite the importance of such linguistic stylistic elements in convincing people of delicate matters such as migration and anti-Islamic views, the field of political communication has so far largely overlooked the stylistic aspects of language. This papers offers an analysis of the rhetorical means that are employed by radical right party leaders in six Western-European countries. I apply a systematic linguistic-stylistic analysis of content of nine party leaders posted across Instagram, Twitter and Facebook and describe how politicians carefully craft their online speech, using different rhetorical strategies, when they talk about migrants.

0,"Western societies are affectively polarized. A burgeoning body of literature documents the causes and consequences of this tendency to love like-minded and hate opposing partisans. But what is the individual’s role in that? I argue that partisans are motivated to consolidate affective polarization to establish distinct and superior ingroups. Therefore, they use emotion narratives that a) ascribe normatively desirable emotions to the ingroup, b) ascribe normatively undesirable emotions to the outgroup, and c) maximize the contrast between both groups’ emotional experiences. I illustrate these strategies with a thematic analysis of semi-structured interviews with radical right voters, around whom affective polarization is particularly strong. The results show that partisans use a variety of emotion narratives to consolidate affective polarization. This paper emphasizes an individual’s role in affective polarization and closes by raising avenues for future investigations of this argument.

0,"Under the leadership of President Donald Trump, the United States became increasingly disinterested and even antagonistic towards NATO and the transatlantic alliance (Aggestam & Hyde-Price, 2019). In addition to disrupting the liberal international order and stoking distrust in the American commitment to European security, Trump contributed to a moment in which the EU-US alliance grew more and more unstable. However, the subsequent mission of President Joe Biden to restore trust in the transatlantic partnership may have caused European perceptions of the United States to change. The Trump-Biden leadership transition highlights an interesting puzzle through which the external perceptions of alliance partners can be investigated and better understood. This paper applies image theory to the transatlantic relationship to study how European perceptions of the US may have changed during the Trump-Biden leadership transition. It contributes to external perceptions literature by spotlighting the citizen image and exploring public perceptions of the United States and its leadership. This paper also addresses gaps in past scholarship by investigating the potential inadequacy of image theory for understanding alliances. Just as Herrmann & Fischerkeller (1995) argued that the enemy image is insufficient for understanding the nature of negative external perceptions, applying image theory to EU-US relations may indicate that we need more than a one-dimensional ally image to make sense of the transatlantic partnership.",Maastricht Universiteit,,,,,,,,Maastricht Universiteit,,Hannah Jakob Barrett,,,,,,,,Hannah Jakob Barrett,,European Union,International Relations,Political Psychology,USA,National Perspective,,,,"We May Be Allies, But We’re Not Friends: Using Image Theory to Study European Perceptions of the Trump-Biden Leadership Transition",https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64827&EventID=185

0,"Migrants’ exclusion from social benefits and programs in the established welfare states of European host countries represents a major challenge to the achievement of migrants’ social rights (Sainsbury, 2012). The present article deals with this topic from the angle of political research, and specifically the literature on the so-called “welfare chauvinism” (Andersen and Bjørklund 1990, p. 212). 
The article specifically focuses on welfare chauvinism at the policy level, i.e., exclusionary social policies towards migrants. Several studies have highlighted that welfare chauvinism is a nuanced concept, i.e., different forms may exist in policy frameworks and debates (strong vs. soft and direct vs. indirect chauvinism). Moreover, the strength of welfare chauvinism also varies across different types of welfare programs (means-tested and universal vs. insurance-run ones). However, the present article argues that scholars have not paid enough attention to whether and how welfare chauvinism varies (stronger/weaker, direct/indirect) across different groups of migrants. 
Against this background, the present paper explores how and why welfare chauvinist policies vary across four different groups: refugees, asylum-seekers, migrant workers from inside the EU and those from extra-EU countries. The analysis is specifically focused on the perspective of politicians and policy makers, i.e., the rationales and criteria they rely on to promote differentiated forms of exclusion and discrimination in the formulation of social policies. It draws from both the deservingness literature (van Oorschot 2006, 2008; Nielsen et al., 2019) and the field of research about the effect of legal status on immigrants’ policy outcomes (Fasani, 2014). The rationales and criteria are investigated by means of a qualitative content analysis of speeches made by politicians and deputies during parliamentary debates and on social networks. More specifically, the speeches analyzed are those where politicians discuss the implementation of some selected chauvinist-oriented policy reforms addressing different groups of migrants.
The analysis is focused on 2 countries, Austria and the UK. These are vastly different in terms of welfare regimes, government coalitions promoting chauvinist-oriented policies, ext., but they share a similar outcome: the implementation of exclusionary policy reforms targeting the different groups of migrants mentioned above. Accordingly, these cases provide an ideal setting to comparatively explore how and why welfare chauvinism varies across these different groups.",LUISS University,,,,,,,,LUISS University,,Irene Landini,,,,,,,,Irene Landini,,Public Policy,Welfare State,Immigration,Policy-Making,,,,,Welfare chauvinism at the policy level,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65520&EventID=185
0,"As long as pandemic wave spread, the scientific debate has even more focused on the role of the State. Coming from years of retreat in sectors like instruction, culture, wealth and, more in general, social and economic rights, the common sight of social and political scientists has growingly converged towards a mainstream view based on the so called Neoliberist thought: less State, more market, as to say the reduction of State power in favour of the gain of private actors which developed their business worldwide. The pandemic spread has undoubtedly enforced inequalities and poverties not only in the less developed countries, but also, and above all, in Europe and USA. This evidence has led to give more accountability to the above mention vision. But, is it really possible to assert this? 
Our hypothesis is that, contrary to the dominant vision, States not only strengthened their political power, but they have also begun a new “Great Deal” era based upon public investments concerning public health, infrastructure, economic transition and other seminal policies with the aim to support the consequences of the Covid-19 in terms of development and social rights.
To corroborate our hypothesis, a multi-sources and multi-layer comparative approach has been adopted to study the actors, the contents and the measures assumed by national governments in front of the pandemia. Focusing on the analysis of both the reforms and the investments included in the design of the National Recovery and Resilience Plans, this study aims to confirm the relevant commitment of European and Usa governments to make any possible effort to mitigate the economic and social impact of the coronavirus pandemic, reaffirming their power as sovereign states.  They have gained a new space of action in a new-born era. A conceptual grid has guided the qualitative analysis; data on investments and growth has integrated and made more precise the role of States in this deep change process (EU, Investment Monitor, 2021).
The discussion of the abovementioned aspects will try to establish if this massive amount of financial resources will return outcomes in terms of a general and more equal growth, followed by a sensible turning point concerning social rights or they will be destined to reinforce and to consolidate disparity.

0,"A commonplace finding in studies of local government amalgamation reforms is that the question of merging one’s own municipality with a neighboring unit often elicit stronger and more outspoken attitudes of support and opposition among voters than do many other issues that cross local council’s agendas. For local elected representatives, understanding voters’ attitudes towards merger can impact crucially on their chances of reelection. The task of predicting voters’ attitudes to merger proposals is however confounded by the fact that the consequences of a merger may be complex and multi-dimensional. While some voters may for instance appreciate the prospects of a more cost-efficcient local administration, or believe that enlargement may improve the quality of municipal services by way of increased professionalization, others may make more of the perceived risk of less effective representation or the loss of long-held local identities. 
Citizens’ attitudes to local government amalgamation have been analyzed mainly based on empirical evidence from surveys to random samples of citizens, or data on local referendum results. To our knowledge, however, no study so far has analyzed patterns of opposition and support for merger with reference to precise data about a real-life mergers well known to the respondents. Such analysis is interesting because it elucidates quite precisely how much weight – if any – local actors actually assign to the wide spectrum of costs and benefits associated with merger. As noted by the author of a survey-based analysis of attitudes to metropolitan mergers, “to make a statement about mass public preferences for specific reform types (…) would require surveying citizens’ preferences at a moment when different reform options are discussed” (Strebel 2021b, 20). Our study does just that, by surveying citizens of 119 Norwegian local governments in the fall of 2019, just a few months before merger of their own unit with one or more neighboring units was implemented, as the result of a national local government reform decided more than two years in advance. The considerable interim period and the high political salience of the reform means that these respondents whould be highly knowledgable about the upcoming merger, and in a good position to assess the costs and benefits associated with merging. At the same time, the known identity of each merger consortium allows the use of quantitative indiators of a wide range of outcomes for each of the merger partners, such as likely financial gains or losses or effects on political representation. The overarching research question is: To what extent can citizens’ attitudes to municipal mergers be explained by costs and benefits incurred by merging with a specific consortium of neighboring units?","Institute for Social Research, Oslo",Universitetet i Oslo,,,,,,,Universitetet i Oslo,,Marte Winsvold,Jan Klausen,,,,,,,Jan Klausen,,Citizenship,Democracy,Local Government,,,,,,What determines citizens’ attitudes to municipal mergers?,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64396&EventID=185
0,"In Hungary, first years of pandemic changed the policy content of Prime Minister’s speeches radically. Dominant policies of the last decade, such as family policy and labor, were replaced by health and by issues related to the significant social and economic effects of coronavirus. This change, however, not only affected the policy content of Viktor Orbán’s communication, but it also reshaped the logic of the structure of his speeches. Before pandemic, highlighted policy issues derived mostly from the agenda of the government, while external influences were able to distract Orbán’s attention very rarely. Such a change was experienced only in 2015, when migration crisis swept across the countries of the European Union, including Hungary. However, migration-management was integrated into the political strategy of the government, and the Prime Minister raised it into the group of symbolic policy areas of his communication very soon. 
How did the government handle the external policy impact of coronavirus in the first two years of pandemic? What changes did the coronavirus make in the content of Prime Minister’s speeches? We assume that government responds to COVID-19 can be approached in two ways. On the one hand, virus-related issues, such as the number of new cases or the effectiveness of vaccines, overshadowed other policy issues rapidly, as migration policy did. However, COVID-19 wave intensifies confronted the government with a new and unknown enemy, thus epidemic management not always brought as successful results as the public expected. During the deepening periods of the virus, therefore, health policy could not able to be the only leg of government crisis communication. As a respond, in the first years of pandemic, Prime Minister usually underlined important government successes in other policy areas (such as to the (re)introduction of a 13-month pension system in social policy), and put a quasi-equal attention on them to soft the edge of the crisis for the citizens and to increase people’s trust in the government. New lines of Prime Minister’s communication strategy therefore might be a significant cornerstone of the investigation of government crisis management in Hungary.
We examine two type of speeches of the Prime Minister. First, we analyze his weekly interviews of the last two years (from March 2020) at ‘Good Morning Hungary!’. This radio show presents the only forum, where Orbán prefers to give comprehensive overviews about government strategies to the public.

We use two datasets built by the Hungarian Comparative Agendas Project (CAP).

0,"This paper examines methods of political science from the vantage point of deliberative democracy. It investigates how instruments of political science might activate responses which are more or less accessible and empowering to participants. Over 30 years have passed since Dryzek declared ‘the mismeasure of political man’ (1990), and called for more discursive methods of political science. This paper argues that measuring political behaviors in ways that assume citizens capable of political action (still) faces several challenges, some of which have gained traction in recent years through ‘failures’ of elections or referenda, which were frequently framed as people simply not being capable of making voting decisions in line with their interests. 
This paper re-examines this argument, and asks in how far political science might invoke deliberative versus undeliberative ways of communicating about politics. It then presents a systematic overview of discursive methodologies in the field of democratic innovations. Potential areas of further development are identified, and the potentials of deliberation as a method of political science is explored. The paper posits that broadening the forms of communication that are activated or permissible in empirical methods strengthens the extent to which political science can predict real-world behavior, and can even contribute to societal democratization.",Universität Stuttgart,,,,,,,,Universität Stuttgart,,Franziska Maier,,,,,,,,Franziska Maier,,Democracy,Political Methodology,Experimental Design,,,,,,What do people communicate as survey participants?

0,"The starting point of the analysis is the observation that in such East and Central European countries as Belarus, Poland, and Lithuania around 45% of citizens think that democracy is a very good system to govern their countries. At the same time Freedom House classifies Belarus as “consolidated authoritarian regime”, Poland – as “semi-consolidated democracy” and Lithuania – as “consolidated democracy”. Moreover, in Ukraine only 34% think democracy is very good and in Hungary – 61%. These two countries are both “transitional or hybrid regimes” according to Freedom House Classification. 
The question is though whether the inhabitants of these mentioned countries think of the same “democracy” when they assess if it a good system for their country? 
The WVS / EVS data allow to shed light on the meaning attached to the term “democracy”, (see e.g Welzel and Kirsch, 2017), but they did not analyse particular countries. 
In my paper I am going to analyse the attitudes towards democracy and understanding of this notion in the mentioned countries as a part of their relationship to the West and as a part of their perceived position in Europe. Within several recent years Poland and Hungary noted the substantial decrease in the Freedom House’s democracy score. What does this mean for the perspective of Poland and Hungary in the EU? What are the reasons people become skeptical about democracy as a way of governing their countries? 
The initial analyses show that different ways of understanding democracy relate to a different level of important resources—economic, social, and cultural—and related to a separate set of values and expectations. Can the disappointment with the regime performance lead to increasing skepticism towards democracy as such and to erosion of democracy in the mentioned countries?

0,"In Canada and around the world, the COVID-19 pandemic exposed numerous gaps in the regulation of institutional long-term care (LTC) (also known as nursing homes or aged care homes) (Liu et el., 2020; Jackman, 2020). Accordingly, there has been a flurry of reform proposals originating from numerous sources to improve LTC around the globe. The purpose of this paper is to report on the preliminary findings of an on-going research about more effective inspection and enforcement in the LTC sector in Ontario, which is the largest province in Canada. This project is situated in the regulation and governance literature. This research is explicitly aimed at analysis and critique of regulatory design, implementation and enforcement in the LTC system in Ontario.
The first part of the paper introduces three theories: responsive regulation (Ayres & Braithwaite 1992; Braithwaite, 2002; Parker 2021), compliance (Parker & Nielsen, 2011; Parker & Nielsen, 2017; van Rooij & Sokol, 2021) and hybrid accountability (Benish, 2020; Benish & Mattei, 2020).  It is followed by the methodology section. The second part provides an introduction to the LTC sector in Ontario. The main part summarizes the findings from a small number of key informant interviews and an anonymous on-line survey with participants in the sector. My hypothesis is that the current enforcement strategies do not appear to evoke responsiveness in at least some of the LTC homes because the regulator’s approach is not dynamic: the regulator does not change its mix of “carrots” and “sticks” in order to respond to the motivations and behaviours of homes. If deterrence is indeed achieved dynamically through escalation (Dukes et al., 2014), then Ontario’s approach is best described as passive.

0,"What drives public support for military action and opposition for compromise among societies mired in prolonged conflict? Is it the hope to win or the lack of hope for peace? Public opinion polls conducted during protracted conflict have consistently shown that most citizens oppose compromise and support military measures against their rivals. One reason people support military action and oppose compromise lies in their belief that victory over their adversary is possible. The greater the belief in the likelihood of victory, the greater the support for military measures and the greater the opposition to compromises in future negotiations. However, it could also be postulated that the main driver of the same phenomenon is rooted in the lack of hope for peace. The lower the belief in the likelihood of peace, the higher the support for military action and reluctance to support compromises. Of course, the two explanations are not mutually exclusive. Citizens entrapped in conflict can simultaneously have high hopes for victory and low hopes for peace. The question is which hope is more dominant when citizens formulate their stance about armed action and concession-making. We tested the relative predicting power of hope for victory and lack of hope for peace in a study conducted among 500 Israelis and 500 West Bank Palestinians. Results first show that in the context of a protracted intractable conflict, citizens' have high hopes for victory and low hope for peace. Notably, the lack of hope for peace was a stronger predictor of Israelis' and Palestinians' support for armed action and opposition for concession making than their hope for victory. It seems that during protracted conflict, public support for violence and opposition to compromise are not driven mainly by the people's belief in victory but from their belief in the impossibility of peace.

0,"The study of ethnic-minorities’s voting behaviour explain the loyalty of ethnic-minority voters to social-democratic parties by two different mechanisms: that they vote on the basis of their social economic-position or that they vote on the basis of their ethnic identification, a form of socio-tropic voting based on the interests of their ethnic group. Such socio-tropic voting made them loyal to social-democratic parties in most European countries; however, research on the 2017 elections in the Netherlands shows that a segment of them has become estranged from social-democrats and now votes for ethnic-minority-interest parties. In 2021, more ethnic-minority-interest parties arose nationally, raising the question how they compete over the different communities of ethnic-minority voters. 
Using the unique Dutch Ethnic Minority Election Survey 2021, of the election year in which three ethnic-minority-interest parties competed (DENK, BIJ1, NIDA), we shed new light on the preference for such parties in two ways. As we distinguish between multiple ethnic-minority-interest parties. These differ in political positions, in particular where it comes to moral conservatism, and in which ethnic communities their candidates are rooted in, we can disentangle the alignment of voters by ethnic origin and by political positions. Our findings show that the new BIJ1 particularly draws citizens who perceive immigrant-group discrimination, whereas DENK and NIDA attract mostly religious Muslims voters who support multiculturalism, and also who perceive discrimination. Moreover, Asian-Dutch (other than Turkish-Dutch) and Latin-American Dutch (other than Surinamese-Dutch) do not vote for these ethnic-minority-interest parties.",University of Utrecht,"Departments of Political Science and Public Administration, Universiteit Leiden",Radboud Universiteit Nijmegen,,,,,,University of Utrecht,,Marcel Lubbers,Simon Otjes,Niels Spierings,,,,,,Marcel Lubbers,,Political Parties,Immigration,Voting Behaviour,,,,,,What drives the propensity to vote for ethnic-minority-interest parties?,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64448&EventID=185

0,"This paper considers the possibilities of centering the material body as a site of and resource for the history and theory of democracy. It argues that by foregrounding the body as an object of intellectual history, we can methodologically queer interpretative practices of political theory. The paper begins by revisiting Quentin Skinner’s foundational arguments for intellectual history by outlining how intellectual historians took inspiration from the linguistic turn of the mid-20th century in order to respond to dominant Marxian accounts of interpretation. Intellectual historians such as Skinner argued that language is not an ideological effect of the material relations of production but in fact an independent form of social action. They argued that the discursive circulation of ideas has world-constituting effects, and in so doing, established the contextual study of language as central to intellectual history. Having outlined the role of discourse as an object and method of study, the paper shows how this view of language finds affinity with dominant political historiographies of the democratic transformations of the 18th century. Turning to the work of Claude Lefort and Jürgen Habermas, I argue that despite deep disagreements between the traditions of radical and deliberative democracy both authors view democracy’s historical emergence as the result of the destruction of the king’s two bodies and the liberation of symbolic discourse. I suggest that this historiography of democracy has unwittingly organized general methodological approaches in democratic theory and intellectual history around questions of discourse. 
To provide an alternative method of political theorizing, the paper presents an alternate historiography of democracy by turning to Michel Foucault’s History of Sexuality, Vol. I (HS). While the conception of power developed in HS has been widely influential among political theorists, Foucault’s insights are rarely read in the context of his wider discussion on the emergence of sexuality as a category of politics. Accordingly, I contend that HS is rarely read by political theorists as a text of queer political theory. By attending to Foucault’s historical account of sexuality, I argue that HS opens new considerations on the role of bodies in the study of politics. To showcase the methodological possibilities this alternative perspective makes possible, the paper ends by providing a queer-feminist rereading of the bourgeois public sphere. Focusing on freemasonry as the largest fraternal organization in the 18th century, I show how new corporeal practices of homosociality premised on women’s exclusion enabled bourgeois men to establish new democratic relations of equality. By attending to the political significance of the material body for analyzing the bourgeois public sphere, the paper thus provides one instance of how a queer-feminist practice of intellectual history can open new possibilities for research beyond a narrow focus on discourse.",Freie Universität Berlin,,,,,,,,Freie Universität Berlin,,Aylon Cohen,,,,,,,,Aylon Cohen,,Constitutions,Gender,Political Theory,Representation,Knowledge,Memory,Narratives,LGBTQI,What is Intellectual in Intellectual History?

0,"Research shows that young people get their information on most topics mainly online and increasingly via (algorithmically curated) social media, while older adults more often use mass media, too.  This constitutes a growing fragmentation of news repertoires (set of channels and sources used for news consumption) between cohorts. Given today’s high-choice media environment and unprecedented levels of personalization of media diets, scholars started to question if an overarching public sphere with a common news agenda (set of most important topics), conceptualized as a necessary condition of participatory democracy, is still given under these circumstances. 
This resulted in research about filter bubbles, disinformation, political polarization and fragmentation of audiences over the last years. What is mainly missing in the literature is research into the understandings and practices of young people around news use on the one hand, and on possible fragmentation of news agendas based on different news repertoires on the other: Do different societal groups come across the same set of topics in their daily media diets? Where do they find their information? Do they consider the same issues as salient, on which they as citizens or the government should act upon? 
This paper constitutes the first part of a bigger research project and aims to close the first gap. It focuses on the definitions of “news” that teenagers have, on their respective news repertoires, consumption practices and underlying citizenship concepts: What kind of information do they consider as news? How often do they follow them? Why is that important to them? On what channels and in what social contexts do they come across which topics? Teenagers’ understandings may differ substantially from politicians’, teachers’ and researchers’ definitions. Profound understanding of the knowledge and conceptualizations that young people have as a basis for their active citizenship is therefore crucial, even more so, as research has consistently shown that corresponding practices and patterns are developed during adolescence and remain remarkably stable over time.
I will use a Q sort activity with think aloud method, followed by explorative qualitative interviews with teenagers in Austria (aged 14-18). As active voting right is granted with 16 years, there is interesting variance in terms of (formalized) participation rights within the age group.
Ideally the data allows for the inductive elaboration of types of news repertoires and types of conceptualizations of news and inferences to underlying citizenship concepts. Contributions to the growing research into subjective definitions of key concepts in citizenship education and to audience studies (news repertoires and consumption habits) are expected.

0,"Policy commitments are risky to make for political parties, because voters will punish them, if they break them after the election. Yet, parties make hundreds of commitments, and the number has even increased in recent decades. Why do parties commit themselves to their future behaviour to such a high extent? In this paper, I argue that parties are particularly likely to use a policy committing strategy, when they have increased their emphasis on an issue from the previous election. By making commitments, parties try to regain credibility by increasing the electoral costs of ignoring this issue after the election. In this way, parties use commitments to trade future flexibility in the policy-making process for credibility among the electorate in the present. I test this argument by manually coding tens of thousands quasi-sentences in election manifestos from a diverse set of countries and over several elections. Empirically, I show that parties use the policy committing strategy to a higher extent when they have increased the saliency of an issue. These results have important implications for party strategies, issue competition, and policy-making.",Aarhus Universitet,,,,,,,,Aarhus Universitet,,Mathias Bukh Vestergaard,,,,,,,,Mathias Bukh Vestergaard,,Political Parties,Agenda-Setting,Political Regime,,,,,,What is your agenda?’ How political parties use commitments to credibly change their issue priorities,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=66503&EventID=185
0,"In parliamentary democracies, cabinet ministers are seen as essential for policymaking. However, not all ministers make policy changes. Some make broad reforms, while others maintain the status quo. This is not only a result of the difference in the ministers’ motivations. In some cases, motivated ministers cannot realize their policy preferences. Existing research on the relations between the politicians and the administrators often focuses on the dynamics between the two and the extent to which the minister is capable of changing the policy. However, the minister’s policymaking is not only a product of the minister’s relations with the bureaucracy. Other factors that have to do with the ministers’ characteristics, such as knowledge or experience or party affiliation, also are likely to play a role. This paper aims to examine what makes a policy-changer cabinet minister. The paper is based on a mixed-method design of in-depth interviews with former cabinet ministers in Israel and a quantitative analysis of budget changes in 20 cabinet ministries from 1997-to 2019. Preliminary findings suggest that the ministers’ political experience and knowledge of the political process are extremely important for changing the policy. Knowledge of the policy field and persistence are also important for the bureaucracy to support the minister. At the same time, knowledge is not a sufficient condition. A minister who lacks political experience will need the political support of the party leader or the prime minister to make policy changes successfully. These findings contribute to our understanding of the advantages and shortcomings of technocrat ministers and the role of cabinet ministers in parliamentary democracies.",Bar Ilan University,,,,,,,,Bar Ilan University,,Ilana Shpaizman,,,,,,,,Ilana Shpaizman,,Political Leadership,Public Policy,Policy Change,Policy-Making,,,,,What makes a policy-changer minister?

0,"What makes climate policy acceptable in middle income countries? Novel evidence on the role of compensation and information
Just transitions aim at making deep green transformations fair and socially just. This is both intrinsically important, as well as instrumental; in fact, it has been found that fairness is a critical factor of climate policy acceptance by citizens. Carbon fiscal reforms have, in the past, often met strong political opposition, as witnessed with the Witness the French “yellow vests” protests and subsidy reforms in low and middle income countries (Klenert et al., 2018). One way of making climate policy fair is to use social protection instruments to compensate potential losers from climate policy. Despite the recent surge in the use of simulations to understand the incidence of carbon pricing also for lower income countries, the issue of preference and acceptability of carbon ricing and revenue recycling has been explored mainly for advanced economies (Maestre-Andrés, Drews, Savin, & van den Bergh, 2021). This is important as low- and middle-income countries will also need to implement green transformations; and because in those countries social goals, such as poverty eradication, my still be the most important ones. Social protection is also critical in the context of the COVID-19 crisis.
To start addressing this gap, we conduct survey experiments in three countries across three different continents: Ghana, Philippines and Peru. In each country, we survey 900 middle class households in urban areas. More specifically, we explore factors that may increase the public acceptance of policy packages. We first focus on the role of the framing and information given; in fact, acceptability is also strongly linked to perceived fairness and knowledge. We then explore two types of revenue recycling options with differing degrees of direct cost or compensation to the participant: social protection programs and real donations to environmental projects. Using existing social protection programs could increase the saliency of revenue recycling and acceptability of carbon pricing overall and especially for prosocial, altruistic individuals. Revenue recycling to environmental projects via donations is likely to work well for people with high environmental concern and low trust in government.
The results will shed light on the policy mix that maximizes acceptability by citizens. This is in turn important for policy implementation, as public acceptance is a crucial determinant of the political feasibility of climate policies. In particular, given the importance of justice and inclusion, it is critical to understand the available design options of carbon fiscal reforms, and especially of the social protection component, that best serve this goal. By having a comparative study design, we will also try to shed light not just at addressing the research gap in terms of low and middle income countries, but look at what other structural factor is important.",German Institute of Development and Sustainability (IDOS),,,,,,,,German Institute of Development and Sustainability (IDOS),,Babette Never,,,,,,,,Babette Never,,Social Justice,Developing World Politics,Climate Change,Survey Experiments,Energy Policy,,,,What makes climate policy acceptable in middle income countries?,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64354&EventID=185
0,"Why do people support political leadership? With the increased support for populist and illiberal leaders in western society, this age-old question has gained new relevance (Laing 2021; Weber 1978 [1964]). While this question is usually raised in the national context, it is increasingly relevant for the European Union (EU). Over the past decade, the EU has faced an unprecedented sequence of crises that demanded common and decisive leadership while suffering from a legitimacy problem. 
In EU studies, the question of legitimacy has been approached predominantly from an institutional perspective and rarely focuses on the role individual leaders play in this. However, individual EU leaders - supranational and national – play an increasingly important role in determining the legitimacy of the EU in the eyes of the people. Moreover, the attribution of legitimacy to a ‘distant’ polity like the EU also has an important psychological dimension (Nielsen and Capelos 2018; Popper 2013; Ruchet 2011; Van Esch 'The nature of the european leadership crisis and how to solve it' 2017)
Our paper draws upon insights from EU and leadership studies to gain a better understanding of citizens’ support for EU leadership as well as its effect on the legitimacy of the EU. It uses an unique survey of citizens attitudes towards different types of EU leaders in nine EU member states to explore the extent to which their evaluation of these leaders in terms of their ideological views, credibility or whether they are democratically elected – as well as (social) psychological factors - like social identification and emotions - play a role in peoples’ trust in the EU (Gooty et al. 2010; Haslam, Reicher, and Platow 2011; Van Zuydam 2018).",University of Utrecht,University of Utrecht,,,,,,,University of Utrecht,,Sebastiaan Steenman,Femke Van Esch,,,,,,,Femke Van Esch,,European Union,Political Leadership,Political Psychology,Public Opinion,Survey Research,,,,"What makes the EU legitimate?

0,"In this paper, I examine how metaphors have been used in support of ideological arguments in the history of modern political and economic thought, and analyse their impact. The usage of biological metaphors in modernist Eurocentric social science has a long tradition, wherein structural or functional elements of 'natural life' are employed to make ideological arguments in social science that underpin specific non-neutral ways of structuring 'society' and 'economy' or to canvass support for particular policy choices. Think of Smith and Keynes using Mandeville's fable of the bees for advancing a specific account of economic organisation by Smith, the comparisons of corals with socialist systems made by Kropotkin and Marx, the continued borrowing of pest and immunisation metaphors from invasive biology for xenophobic nationalist politics that Arendt presciently warned about. Even the structures, rhythms, and imaginaries of plant life have played an important role in how intellectual thought has functioned, from the signification of Voltaire's garden in Candide to the lush forests of St. Germain where Rousseau discovers both his transcendental self and the soul of humanity (to him). The arch neoclassical monetarist economist Friedman used the idea of the leaves in a tree in his 'as if' argument to support the use of unrealistic assumptions in economic theorising, ultimately using the plant imaginary to claim that perfect rationality can be assumed for human beings. The state has, of course, often been seen as a biological organism, Morgenthau referred to the clock mechanism for balance of power, complexity economics refers to forest metaphors, political conflict is modelled along the lines of the 'hawk-dove' game.

0,"Economic populism is a highly contested concept in the social sciences. The salient characteristics of the original concept of economic populism such as highly redistributive policies and unsustainable public finances, can hardly be detected nowadays in advanced economies with populist governments. By focusing on Hungary, the paper demonstrates that although unsustainable macroeconomic policies might not be on the menu of populist incumbents any longer, governments can still actively intervene in the economy. As opposed to the original version of the concept of economic populism adopted in the unique circumstances of Latin America, Hungarian populists seem to shy away from manipulating macroeconomic policies, opting to redefine the incentives systems of the economy instead. The paper demonstrates that, in the name of the people, the Hungarian government vehemently tries to alter the institutional landscape of the Hungarian economy with the aim of tracking down the (former) elite and cementing its own economic power. As a consequence, while macroeconomic sustainability is indeed not threatened in the short term by incumbents, the cost of reshaping economic institutions can significantly lower the country’s potential for economic growth in the longer term.

Although the extent to which the pandemic affected people’s lives varies greatly from country to country, as do the measures taken to mitigate it, consequences are noticeable for everyone. From public life to private households, there has been everything from slight changes to drastic restructuring. While most of the measures are temporary, researchers from a wide range of disciplines are asking about their potential long-term effects. Taking up on this, our study’s interest lies in the impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic on the way that families organize their everyday life. More precisely, we argue that especially school closures and the temporary lack of institutional care facilities for children in some countries may have significant and potentially persistent effects on the within-household division of labor. We will therefore address the following research questions: Have the Covid-19 pandemic measures and different forms of lockdown had a significant impact on the actual intra-family division of labor? If so, in which way and for whom? 
To answer this, we use novel data from an international survey in five countries that asks parents with children under the age of 15 about ongoing changes in the organization and division of labor of paid work, care and housework between the partners. To capture potential varying consequences of different measures, we include countries that have pursued very diverse strategies in the context of this pandemic, namely Sweden, Switzerland, USA, Finland and Germany. In this vein, our study may not only contribute to a better understanding of new patterns regarding the within-household division of labor emerging during a period of an external shock, but also shed light on questions of whether and how the pandemic may affect families and their position in the society in the long term.",Universität Bern,Universität Bern,,,,,,,Universität Bern,,Meret Lütolf,Dominique Oehrli,,,,,,,Meret Lütolf,,Gender,Social Policy,USA,Welfare State,Family,Comparative Perspective,Men,,What remains?

0,"The outset of the COVID-19 pandemic confronted the world with a crisis situation that was massive in scale, rapid in pace, and global in scope. In this situation, governments and heads of state used televised press conferences as instruments of political crisis communication, that is, to explain the nature of the crisis to the public and to announce measures on how to contain it. Although existing research has addressed different elements (e.g. metaphors) or instruments (e.g. Twitter), comparative research on the framing of the crisis is still scarce. In particular, little is known about how different states utilize threat narratives during crises as a means to ease the implementation of restrictive measures. With this paper, we fill this gap in the literature by answering the question of how institutional contexts as well as the pandemic development influence the use of threat narratives in crisis communication? 
We argue that the political system, the course of the pandemic, and the state of the national health system systematically impact the ways in which threats e.g. to (individual or collective) health, the economy, security, or liberty, are constituted in governments’ crisis communication. To test these propositions, we draw on a unique dataset of 1013 press conferences held by heads of government and states in 17 OECD countries in the first phase of the pandemic in early 2020. Combining different approaches of automated text analysis, we will identify rhetorical strategies and show how governments and heads of state adapt crisis communication over the course of the pandemic.

0,"Research on democratic preferences has barely focused on young people. This is especially true for pupils in school, who are yet to become democratic citizens. Regarding democratic attitudes, the controversial study by Foa and Munck (2016) – using data from the World Values Survey- claims that young adults in the U.S. and Europe are abandoning democracy as the key procedural value. The various refutations notwithstanding (e.g., Norris 2017; Wuttke et al. 2020) we argue that such traditional survey research on democratic preferences may tap into non-attitudes, requiring the adoption of more advanced methods, namely scenario designs including an information package (see Goldberg and Bächtiger 2022). By the same token, existing research on democratic preferences using scenario designs usually focuses on representative vs participatory forms of decision-making (Werner and Marien 2021), ignoring the fact that citizens (and pupils) may also favour “executive” forms of decision-making (whereas studies focusing on technocratic ´Stealth´ attitudes only use traditional survey techniques; Van der Molen 2017). To close these various research gaps, we perform a conjoint experiment with a large-scaled representative sample of approximately 2000 15-year old German pupils in Baden-Württemberg (conducted in February/March 2022) focusing on three forms of policy-making using a conjoint experiment: a representative mode in form of a parliament, a participatory approach in form of a citizen forum, and an executive model approach focusing on an assertive “leader”.  The conjoint experiment contains further attributes, such a consultation with experts vs making decisions on their own, fast vs slow decision-making, various forms of authorization (including direct-democratic voting) as well as the winner/loser dimension. While we are interested in a global assessment which democratic modes are favoured by pupils, we also engage in subgroup analysis. We examine preferences of respondents contingent on their prior political dispositions (political sophistication or political trust) and psychological dispositions with a particular eye on depressive symptoms (Landwehr and Ojeda 2020), anxiety and threat-perceptions (Corona Pandemic, Climate Change, War). We expect that pupils with high levels of political sophistication prefer representative or participatory forms of policy-making, while pupils with populist attitudes and anxious pupils are more supportive of executive forms of policy-making.",Universität Stuttgart,Universität Stuttgart,,,,,,,Universität Stuttgart,,Vanessa Schwaiger,André Bächtiger,,,,,,,Vanessa Schwaiger,,Decision Making,Survey Experiments,Youth,,,,,,What young people want from democracy: A conjoint experiment on democratic designs with 15-year old pupils,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64184&EventID=185

Similarly, we know little about variation, i.e. between administrative domains, over time, or cross-national. This paper seeks to theorize and conceptualize administrative silos.

0,"External pressures to comply with EU rules have allegedly eroded the opportunities of national governments to autonomously adopt and implement policies and respond to national constituencies. Conversely, flexible supranational policies enable governments to implement the most appropriate policy options and respond to the demands of citizens. Moreover, the increased competences of the EU are coupled with differentiation, where EU legislation does not equally apply to all countries.Currently, we lack understanding whether flexibility and differentiation at the EU level contribute to autonomous and responsive policies in the EU countries. This study fills this gap by developing and testing a new theoretical framework about the relationship between EU-level differentiation and national policy implementation. In particular, I expect and find that differentiation resulting from capacity limitations constrains national policies more than differentiation driven by sovereignty concerns. This is because low-capacity governments that are excluded from EU policies have reputational incentives to demonstrate full convergence to the EU demands even when these diverge from national preferences. The results are based on a unique data set on the implementation of immigration, asylum and Schengen directives in 27 countries. The findings have important implications for the alleged trade-off between EU integration and national sovereignty.","Department of Public Administration, Erasmus University Rotterdam",,,,,,,,"Department of Public Administration, Erasmus University Rotterdam",,Asya Zhelyazkova,,,,,,,,Asya Zhelyazkova,,European Union,Differentiation,Domestic Politics,,,,,,When a looser Union hits home: Does flexible integration affect the implementation of EU asylum and migration policies?,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63557&EventID=185
0,"While not being a new phenomenon, the past years have seen a strong surge of mis- and disinformation. One solution that is often suggested to counter this trend, and that has received a lot of scholarly attention, is the use of so-called fact-checks; instruments which scrutinize (mis)information and indicate to what extent a specific piece of information is correct or incorrect. While many previous studies have demonstrated that fact-checks are effective tools in countering misinformation, less is known about the conditions under which fact-checks are the most effective, which is what we aim to examine with this study.

Concretely, we look at two different factors. First, we are interested to what extent the source of the fact-check matters, comparing fact-checks coming from the traditional media - operationalized in our study as the public broadcaster – with fact-checks from independent organizations. Our expectation is that, in general, fact-checks coming from the public broadcaster will be more effective, as citizens are more familiar with this news source and hence may place more trust in it. However, we expect that this will be moderated by trust in the public broadcaster, both at the individual and country level.

Second, we expect that the extent to which fact-checks are effective depends on how politicized they are, particularly when testing false claims made by political actors. We consider fact-checks to be politicized when they explicitly mention the political actor that made the (false) claim. Fact-checks are depoliticized when they do not mention which actor made the claim. Our expectation is that politicized fact-checks are less effective, especially among supporters of the political actor making the claim, as they may prime partisan identity and hence strengthen partisan motivated reasoning. Although we hypothesize politicized fact-checks to be less effective in all countries, we expect that this will especially be the case in more (affectively) polarized countries.

To test our hypothesis we use data from an experiment that will be conducted across 16 different European countries, with mixed levels of media trust and polarization. In all countries respondents will read the same misinformation story with a national (right-wing) political actor making a false claim about the European immigration numbers. Subsequently, respondents will read a fact-check debunking this misinformation. The fact-check will differ on two dimensions, namely 1) whether it comes from the public broadcast or from an independent fact-check organization, and 2) whether it is politicized or depoliticized. Concretely, this means that we have a 2*2 factorial experimental design, along with a control group that only reads the misinformation article. Afterwards, respondent are asked to what extent they accept the misinformation claim, find the misinformation article credible, and to what extent they would share this article on social media. Hereby we take into account respondents’ prior opinion on immigration and support for the political actor that is used. Additionally, we study how country-level variables such as the level of media trust and polarization moderate the found effects.",University of Amsterdam,Universiteit Antwerpen,University of Amsterdam,,,,,,University of Amsterdam,,Claes De Vreese,Peter Van Aelst,Patrick van Erkel,,,,,,Patrick van Erkel,,Media,Communication,Experimental Design,Survey Experiments,,,,,When do fact-checks work to counter misinformation?

0,"This contribution to the study of ""energy policy conflicts as default"" develops an analysis of knowledge conflicts, or uses of research and expertise by mobilized coalitions with opposing goals. Based on a unique data set of media coverage of a six-year conflict over the Atlantic Coast Pipeline in the U.S., we identify research reports used by supporters and opponents, identify types of studies produced (economic, health and environmental, and political legitimacy), and show differences across the three types of knowledge conflicts. We then show how the conflicts are vetted across social fields (political, media, scientific, regulatory, and juridical). We find that the courts have both the autonomy and authority to engage in world-making decisions about knowledge claims and pipeline outcomes, and we show how the other fields tend to be aligned with industry or not interested in adjudication. We use the concepts of symbolic power and field autonomy help to clarify why some fields approximate a condition of “post-truth” politics and others do not. Where the judicial system is relatively autonomous and open to litigation, facts may indeed matter even in the unequal power relations associated with social movement mobilizations. Awareness of the variations across fields may be valuable for scientists and mobilized publics as they develop strategy.

0,"Interest groups can influence policies by giving input to political parties. Groups possess expertise and information that can help parties develop more efficient and representative policies. But the information provided reflects the policy goals of the group and not the society as a whole. To compensate for this, a party needs input from several groups. But parties have limited capacity and must be selective about what groups they grant access to. The interest group literature on access has devoted little attention to parties beyond general organizational ties. This paper adds to the literature by examining how party and policy specific factors affect the number and composition of groups a party grants access to. Building on theory of parties as rational goal-seeking actors, I theorize that parties will spend more time on policy areas that are important to them and thus grant access to more groups in these areas compared to others. Furthermore, parties will minimize the risk of public criticism and grant access to a more diverse set of groups on these policy areas. The hypotheses are tested by combining the PAIRDEM interest group survey dataset covering seven Western democracies with party salience data from the Manifesto Project. Multiple regression analysis controlling for country fixed effects, media salience and party size, show some support for the hypotheses. Parties grant access to more groups and gather more information on policy areas that are important to them. This implies that policies related to the areas the party prioritizes are the most well-grounded.",Universitetet i Oslo,,,,,,,,Universitetet i Oslo,,Lise Rødland,,,,,,,,Lise Rødland,,Interest Groups,Political Parties,Lobbying,,,,,,When do parties grant access to more interest groups?,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64408&EventID=185
0,"This article explores how women's descriptive representation affects legal gender equality of economic opportunity. Building on existing studies on women's descriptive and substantive representation, we argue that as the proportion of female legislators and ministers increases, legal gender equality of economic opportunity improves. Additionally, a country's institutional context significantly shapes the influence of women in different positions of power on legal gender equality. We thus expect that the higher the legislature's law-making power, the greater the effect of female legislators on legal gender equality; under the same condition, its relative influence compared to female cabinet ministers is also greater. Similarly, we hypothesize that the higher the level of democracy, the more effective female legislators compared to female ministers.
To test these arguments, we draw on the WBL database that provides cross-national information on legal discrimination against women in economic opportunities. Looking at 156 countries from 1970 to 2014, we find that the percentages of both female legislators and female ministers are positively associated with legal gender equality of economic opportunity. We also find that when the legislature's law-making power or the level of democracy are high, the effect of female legislators outweighs that of female cabinet members. These findings are robust to attempts to rule out competing explanations, alternative estimation methods, alternative temporal units of analysis, and alternative samples.
Last, our supplementary analyses reveal that gender quotas are positively associated with legal gender equality and that gender quotas positively interact with the levels of democracy or legislative power in improving legal gender equality of economic opportunity.",Korea University,,,,,,,,Korea University,,Nam Kyu Kim,,,,,,,,Nam Kyu Kim,,Comparative Politics,Democracy,Elites,Gender,Representation,,,,When does Women's Political Power Matter?

Abstract: Cities and local authorities rely on the collaboration of private actors in adapting growing cities to climate change. In 2020, the Institute for Ecological Economy Research used future visioning processes in the city of Munich to involve private actors in climate adaptation processes. The participatory processes featured coloured drawings of two alternative futures presented as street view images for three districts in Munich.  The aim of these processes was to counter increasing urban heat with more urban green and to stimulate a larger debate about alternative futures that goes beyond it. We evaluate the quality of the three visioning processes conducted in different districts of the city from the perspective of five strands of democratic theory. Doing so, we introduce a matrix that can be used to design and evaluate participatory processes according to different goals and requirements, stemming from the different theoretical perspectives on democracy. We expand the range of criteria beyond expertocratic, liberal and (Habermasian) deliberative democracy to criteria like performativity and mobilisation, which go back to radical democracy. We argue that criteria of radical democracy are crucial if we want to assess the capacity of a visioning process to deliver transformative change.
We show that the three future visioning processes in Munich led to competent results, which challenged the status quo, and mobilised politically like-minded people for more urban green. The weaknesses were that the spectrum of participants was too homogeneous and that there was no commitment by the local authority to implement the envisioned futures. Based on our results we demonstrate the importance of using criteria of radical democracy like performativity and mobilisation for future evaluation studies.","Centre for Climate Resilience, Augsburg University",University of Vienna,,,,,,,"Centre for Climate Resilience, Augsburg University",,Angela Oels,Fabian Pfeiffer,,,,,,,Angela Oels,,Democracy,Political Participation,Political Theory,Critical Theory,Climate Change,,,,When is participation in climate futures transformative?

0,"While there is a great deal of research that studies the relationship between repression and mobilization – that is, the repression-dissent nexus – this research presents conflicting findings when it comes to effects of repression on mobilization. Existing literature demonstrates that while repression can quell protest mobilization, it can also lead to more people joining in the protests, ie. backlash mobilization. In explaining these dynamics, newer studies have pointed to the importance of public opinion, underlining how the way outsiders perceive protests and their repression might matter when it comes to the repression-dissent nexus. They also emphasized that protest repression can be perceived differently and hence have differential effects depending on the identity of the outsiders. 

While incorporating the opinions of those who are not necessarily part of the protests in analysing the repression-dissent nexus, this literature, however, does not differentiate between different forms of protest repression, focusing mainly on police violence. In this paper, emphasising the varied mechanisms through which protest repression can happen, we hypothesize that the public might perceive legal forms of repression differently than police repression. We specifically wonder how the enactment of a legal ban prior to a protest can shape public attitudes towards repression and the repressed. We explore this question through the case of Turkey where in the last decade under a profound process of authoritarian transformation protests have faced increasing and varied forms of repression. Notably, protest bans, which are legal forms of repression issued by provincial authorities, constituted an important part of this repression.

In this paper, using an original survey and a survey experiment we conducted in Istanbul during 2020 with a sample of 1003 people, we explore how the public in Istanbul perceives the right to protest and its repression, specifically asking whether different forms of repression affect the public differentially. How does the enactment of a prior legal ban shape public attitudes toward protests and their repression? Do these public reactions differ according to the issue or the organizers of the protest? Do they vary according to the political identifications of the respondents? What kind of justifications for repression resonate with the public? 

Our results show that while most citizens admit the importance of the right to protest, they also support its limitation for various reasons. There is a great deal of cross-partisan acceptance when it comes to repression of protests via protest bans. The “emergency” justifications used by officials to limit the right to protest, such as public security, public health, and public sensibilities resonate with the public. Yet we also encounter significant variations in public opinion. The issue/organizers of protests as well as the partisan identity of respondents matter.

If the increasing visibility of the far right in the 21st century took place in a context of growing relevance of the media for politics, little is known about the mechanisms driving news coverage of rightist protests. Building on social movements research, we advance an innovative input-output process model in which media attention (output) is (also) the result of protest input characteristics for subsequent media coverage. We formulate hypotheses on the drivers of media attention based on protest input characteristics (ideology, issue of protest, and tactics). We use an original dataset of over 4,000 protest events retrieved from online press releases by far-right groups (input) and national quality newspapers (output) in eleven Western and Eastern European countries (2008-2018). We find that quality media react differently to different protest input characteristics, and are most likely to cover events by groups with radical (as opposed to extremist) ideologies, which address core issues like immigration and that trigger the reaction of political opponents.

0,"Over the last decades, judicial institutions in Central and Eastern Europe have made the headlines in different parts of the world following governmental measures limiting their independence. This topic has been examined in different ways both in political science, law and in EU studies (Von Bogdandy 2014; Muller 2015; Pech and Scheppele 2017; Blokker 2019; Czarnota 2018; Bodnar 2021; Kelemen 2017; 2020; Closa 2018) as an illustration of autocratic legalism (Schepele 2018) or democratic backsliding (Bugaric and Ginsburg 2016), as an expression of the populist uprising (Bugaric and Kuhelj 2018; Sadurski 2019) or a counter-revolution (Zielonka 2018; 2019; Holmes and Krastev 2019). While this important body of research mainly focuses on governmental motivations and the role of party politics, little attention has been paid to forms of resistance(s) within the judiciary, when judicial independence is either under strain or undermined. 
Against this backdrop, we aim to contribute to this debate by addressing the following questions: how do judges resist reforms when not only their independence is undermined but also the democratic values of the political regimes are under strain? How do they defend judicial independence? To address this facet still underexplored in the literature, the paper examines judicial actors’ attitudes towards changes related to judicial independence in Poland, Hungary and Romania. We argue that the forms of resistance taken by the judiciary might be driven by ideological, self-interest and professional concerns. In other words, we argue that judges’ mobilization can be expressed as a function of the threat that reforms entail for: i) their ideational beliefs on liberal democracy, ii) judges’ professional/corporatists interests and patterns of career, iii) the professional ethos (e.g. tension with the judges’ role as “bouche de la loi”). 
To do so the paper investigates three national contexts, arguing that while the adoption of measures limiting the independence of the judiciary in Poland by the PiS government has “unified” judges in defending their cause and led to the emergence of a diffuse pan-European network, in the case of Romania the debate has polarized the field for reasons that the papers seek to elucidate. While in contrast, the degree of mobilisation has been lower in Hungary. 
To explain the motivations inspiring judges’ forms of resistance, the paper builds on an original survey on judicial independence distributed among Polish, Romanian, and Hungarian judges. The survey allows disentangling the ideological, self-interest and professional (ethos) drivers of judge’s resistance. Furthermore, the analysis is enriched by the use of social media and semi-structured interviews with judges from the three national contexts focusing on the timing of the mobilization and the patterns of the coalitions formed within and beyond the judiciary. Drawing theoretically on the concept of resistance (Madsen, Cebulak and Wiebusch 2018; Blokker 2020; Coman and Lacroiw 2007; Crespy and Verschueren 2009; Della Porta 2001) and an original set of data, this paper contributes to the literature on democratic backsliding in CEE by showing how one of the state’s power - the judiciary - resists the capturing strategies addressed by political elites.",Université Libre de Bruxelles,Université Libre de Bruxelles,,,,,,,Université Libre de Bruxelles,,Ramona Coman,Leonardo Puleo,,,,,,,Leonardo Puleo,,Europe (Central and Eastern),Democracy,Courts,,,,,,"When the rule of law is under siege, is the judiciary going to resist and how?

0,"Wartime sexual violence has been recognized as a gross human rights violation and a weapon of war, for which justice is due. Transitional justice scholars have pinpointed victim-blaming and victim-shaming culture that the victim survivors face, which is why it is difficult for them to break the silence about wartime rape. This paper investigates how women victims of wartime violence break silence, and whether silence-breaking generates social recognition conceptualized as a form of justice. The analysis turns to the analysis of interactions with the silence-breakers in the public domain. The paper shows that injustice for sexual violence is perpetuated in the public domain even when victims/survivors break the silence. It identifies cultural (family and gender roles) and political (ethno-national) mechanisms that explain how the victims’ act of speaking out is subverted to deny them justice for their suffering. The empirical evidence draws on fieldwork interviews conducted in Kosovo and Croatia, and the analysis of TV interviews, print media and social media. A multi-method comparative analysis of silence-breaking demonstrates how different post-war contexts impact on discursive interactions and social recognition.

0,"To mitigate climate change, many countries are phasing out or expediating retirements of coal-fired power plants (CFPPs). But some 6,500 units totalling 2,000 GW of capacity remain installed globally. In addition, 450 GW of new construction will prolong the lifetime of this fleet. Once built, CFPPs operate for around 40 to 50 years. If all existing and new plants achieved a similar lifetime, some 278 billion t-CO2 would result, blowing any prospect of achieving climate mitigation targets under the Paris Agreement. Strategies are thus needed to confront committed emissions and lock-in, where plant retirement is hampered by financial, political and social factors. Predicting the remaining operational lifetime of existing CFPPs as well as committed emissions and lock-in is therefore a vital step to this end.

Several studies have predicted global CFPP retirement ages. But research has been limited to top-down approaches where retirement volumes or schedules are prescribed in accord with climate mitigation scenarios. Conversely, understanding lacks on the factors that historically influenced CFPP lifetimes and how these will affect future retirement ages. Moreover, many governments and market actors will not confirm to carbon budgets when deciding retirement schedules. Thus, it is still unclear what operational lifetimes to expect in future, what emissions will result, and what countries will suffer most from coal lock-in. 

Accordingly, this research aims to determine the factors that influenced historical CFPP retirements and then predict future retirement ages based on these results. We also aim to predict carbon emissions based on predicted retirement ages and quantify the degree to which particular countries are locked into coal.

Our method has four steps. First, we collected data from Global Energy Monitor to build a sample of roughly 1,600 units retired in 33 countries over 2010 – 2020. Second, we conducted a systematic literature review to identify the factors expected to drive or hamper CFPP retirements. Third, we used supervised machine learning to determine the factors that affected retirements over 2010 – 2020. We then used the results to predict future retirement ages for 6500 units currently active in 69 countries. Fourth, we utilized predicted retirement ages to estimate committed emissions and develop a coal-lock-in index. This reflects the structural difficulty each country is expected to encounter when shifting away from coal.  

The literature review identified 13 country-level factors with data is available. The historical analysis revealed the three most important as: “GHG emissions”, “ renewable energy policy” and “share of renewables”. These are followed by less influential but still important factors like “political stability”, “economic growth”, and “contribution of coal to GDP (coal rent)”. In ongoing work, we will apply this model to predict future retirement ages, committed emissions and coal lock-in.  

We make two important contributions to knowledge. First, by predicting future retirements based on historical evidence and country-specific conditions, we provide more accurate estimates of future CFPP lifetimes and emissions than previous literature. Second, the creation of a novel coal lock-in index allows us to identify global hotspots that merit attention by policymakers and investors.",Mercator Research Institute on Global Commons and Climate Change - MCC Berlin,Kyoto University,,,,,,,Kyoto University,,Niccolò Manych,Gregory Trencher,,,,,,,Gregory Trencher,,Environmental Policy,Political Economy,Global,Empirical,Energy,Energy Policy,,,When will the world’s coal-fired power plants retire?

0,"Going public tactics under the semi-presidential systems usually favor the presidents, as they often emerge victorious from the intra-institutional conflicts (Raunio and Sedelius, 2020; Protsyk ,2006; Pukelis and Jastramskis, 2021). However, research (until now) focused on the most prominent cases of going public, such as expressions of no confidence by the presidents over some ministers or even prime ministers. Such an approach highlights the key points in the competition for power under a semi-presidential system. However, it also ignores the day-to-day functioning of semi-presidential republics and the routine efforts by the presidents to insert themselves into the decisions by government. Moreover, in the absence of substantial formal competencies, presidents in the parliamentary republics may also try to influence the government through the power of public word. In this paper, we conceptualize the going public by the presidents as an instance when a president weighs in on the performance of the cabinet and/or individual minister in media. Cases of going public may vary according to their intensity (how often the president goes public), focus (policy areas and ministers that are targeted) and tone (the level of criticism expressed by the president). In this paper, we focus on the first and second criteria and compare two culturally similar Baltic countries with different political regimes: Lithuania (semi-presidential) and Latvia (parliamentary). Our method is quantitative analysis of texts that mention the cabinet members in media since 2001. We analyze a corpus of web-scraped articles from Delfi: the largest internet news portal in Lithuania and Latvia. In order to capture the overall attention paid to a particular policy sphere and minister, we algorithmically analyze the media texts searching for relevant keywords, such as the name of minister or ministry. To capture the president’s attention to the cabinet and/or individual policy spheres we also look for instances where mentions of cabinet occur alongside the mentions of incumbent president. We then move to the testing of our hypotheses. Our preliminary explanations for the intensity and focus of public attention by the presidents are as follows. First, the patterns of presidential attention will mirror the general pattern of attention to the cabinet and individual policy areas. However, this attention should be relatively larger in areas where the president has most power (foreign policy under a semi-presidential republic). Additionally, presidential attention should be greater in the first year of a presidential term and when a cabinet is weak. Finally, we expect that the intensity of presidential attention should mirror the general powers of the president and thus should be greater in Lithuania than in Latvia.",Vilnius University,Vilnius University,,,,,,,Vilnius University,,Lukas Pukelis,Mažvydas Jastramskis,,,,,,,Lukas Pukelis,,Government,Media,Political Regime,Power,Public Opinion,,,,"Where and why does the president go, when she goes public?

0,"Contact restrictions to contain the COVID-19 pandemic have led to an increased usage of digital communication and participation tools in German political parties (Borucki et al. 2020). The pandemic situation perpetuated the process of established parties’ digital adaption. While previous steps were characterised by weighing processes and restrained development, the pandemic enforced digitalisation at all party levels. Meetings and assemblies in person were not possible due to containment measures, and the shift to the digital was the only viable way to continue political organisation. Accordingly, this shift imposed deep cuts into organisational routines. This article understands the pandemic situation as an external shock (Harmel & Janda 1994) that affects all parties similarly and imposes momentum for party change concerning grassroots participation. While it is not yet foreseeable how changes will unfold, cornerstones for the process of change are being laid during and shortly after the pandemic. Hence, the article focuses on the expectations of rank-and-file members for the post-pandemic future. After two years of the pandemic, members are likely to think about and discuss how member engagement, communication and collaboration will occur when containment measures are no longer in place. It is assumed that, on the one hand, party members across parties broadly agree that party activity will be more digitalised than before the pandemic and that such modernisation is generally regarded as necessary. On the other hand, differences are anticipated regarding the degree to which the widely held expectation of more digitalisation corresponds to personal predilections. Therefore, the article analyses the discrepancies between the expectation of the party members and their individual preferences concerning intra-party participation. Younger members and new members are assumed to expect and welcome the ongoing digitalisation of party membership. In contrast, older and long-standing members might be more critical of abandoning established routines – even if they believe in the need for digital transformation. The study draws data from a party member panel survey conducted in 2020 and 2021 that comprises four panel waves over 12 months. Members of four German political parties were interviewed: CDU, SPD, Bündnis 90/Die Grünen and Die Linke. The results highlight the trade-offs of intra-party digitalisation at the grassroots level. Demands for a modern and adaptable organisation (Michels & Borucki 2020) must be balanced with intra-party resistance, especially among established party members.

Although diffusion is central to the explanation of similarities and differences across international treaties, we know little about when and why a group of countries agrees to copy from foreign treaties and when they decide against doing so. Moreover, scholarly work is largely silent as to where the foreign text comes from: Are rules mostly transferred from own past agreements to own new agreements; or are rules adopted from foreign past agreements to own new ones? What factors systematically mediate between these alternative outcomes? In this paper, we propose a formal model of international bargaining in which parties individually prefer to strike an agreement that is similar to their own past commitments in terms of institutional design. In short, they like to copy-paste from treaties they have signed in the past. Yet, in some situations, the (Nash) bargain solution excludes such an outcome in favour of the adoption of a compromise foreign text. The model predicts that (i) symmetry in bargaining power; and (ii) large discrepancies in terms of bargaining positions between the parties at the negotiating table decrease the likelihood of an agreement based on the own treaty design of a given party. An agreement from outside their own designs is not preferred by any party, but is still superior to investing in creating original rules or to not striking an agreement. We test these propositions with a combination of quantitative text and temporal inferential network analysis. Using text-data from preferential trade agreements and bilateral investment treaties signed between 1945 and 2018, we find that parties indeed prefer to copy-paste their own past designs. However, power-symmetry as well as differences in bargaining positions decrease the likelihood of the recycling of own old treaty texts and makes the negotiating parties more prone to choosing an institutional design outside of their own treaty templates. The paper demonstrates the complexities of institutional design adoption in the international context and shows that bargaining dynamics critically determine the text-source in this diffusion process.",University of Innsbruck,,,,,,,,University of Innsbruck,,Lisa Lechner,,,,,,,,Lisa Lechner,,Institutions,International,Quantitative,Trade,Power,,,,Where to Pick From?

0,"Political parties communicate through multiple communication channels simultaneously. They try to reach different audiences and influence the public debate through these different channels. Political competition therefore happens in several venues. However, most research on issue competition between political parties has a narrow focus on a specific communication channel (e.g. manifestos, press releases) and only few researchers engage in comparison. Furthermore, the few existing comparative studies show a twofold research gap. Firstly, there is conflicting evidence as to whether and to what extent parties communicate differently across communication channels. Secondly, it is unclear which specific issue strategies political parties use in different communication channels and why. This paper takes a step towards closing the outlined research gap by analysing multiple channels of party communication with regard to issues.

Theoretically, the focus is on aspects that influence party issue strategies and on the core characteristics of different communication channels (e.g. audience). The resulting theoretical framework captures why political parties might pursue different issue strategies depending on the type of communication channel.

Methodologically, the paper uses an advanced text-as-data approach to study party communication in Austria, Germany and Switzerland between January 2019 and September 2021. I perform a computer assisted issue classification based on an adapted codebook from the Manifesto Project (MARPOR). The paper studies four types of communication channels: manifestos, press releases, tweets and parliamentary speeches. The statistical analysis focuses on potential differences in party issue strategies between the studied communication channels and the driving factors behind it.

The results of this analysis will provide insights on how political parties communicate in different communication channels, which issue strategies they pursue within these channels and the reasons for this.",WZB Berlin Social Science Center,,,,,,,,WZB Berlin Social Science Center,,Christoph Ivanusch,,,,,,,,Christoph Ivanusch,,Political Competition,Political Parties,Methods,Quantitative,Communication,,,,Where to talk about what?

0,"Which policy tools do governments have at their disposal to address wage inequality? Many OECD countries have experienced growing wage differentials in the past decade. Existing research points to globalisation and technological and institutional changes as crucial drivers. Growing inequalities have given rise to moral, social, and political challenges, and a growing public demand for policymakers to react to these challenges. Yet, despite the vast literature on drivers of wage inequality, there is no comparative research on existing policy tools governments can use to address wage inequality.

This article assesses how policies concerning low wages affect wage inequality. Theoretically, five policies are identified, which most governments already have at their disposal. These policies are characterised by either directly intervening in wage-setting, such as statutory minimum wage, or indirectly influencing wages by affecting workers or employers’ incentives for low paid jobs (e.g., in-work benefits, active labour market policies, unemployment benefits and employment protection legislation). From a theoretical perspective, this article argues that not having a national minimum wage, higher national minimum wage levels, unemployment benefits, and strict employment protection legislation equalises wages. In contrast, in-work benefits and active labour market policies have the opposite effect. 

The empirical analysis is based on data from 30 OECD countries from 2001-2020 collected from OECD/AIAS ICTWSS database and the Comparative Political dataset. The findings suggest that two of the five policies matter for wage inequality. First, higher statutory minimum wages are associated with a decrease in wage inequality at the bottom of the wage distribution. Second, dedicated in-work benefit policies and generous in-work benefits increase wage inequality. Even when controlling for other important drivers of wage inequality, the effect of these two policies are still most dominant, suggesting that policymakers already have available policy tools to address wage inequality.",University of Bergen,,,,,,,,University of Bergen,,Siri Hansen Pedersen,,,,,,,,Siri Hansen Pedersen,,Comparative Politics,Government,Policy Analysis,Political Economy,Public Policy,Social Policy,Welfare State,Quantitative,Which government policies reduce wage inequality?,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65614&EventID=185
0,"Recent studies have found that local climate policies across Europe can vary significantly, although larger cities tend to be more active and set more stringent objectives than smaller municipalities (Salvia et al 2021; Otto et al 2021). However, apart from leading and pioneering cities such as Freiburg, Malmö, Bristol or Heidelberg, there has been less research into mid-sized cities, particularly around the local factors that influence their climate activities.
This paper draws on document analysis and interviews in 21 mid-sized German cities to examine how local socioeconomic, institutional and political factors shape climate policymaking and strategy. We group these 21 municipalities into three categories: (post)industrial cities (which may have experienced recent structural change), ‘World Heritage’ cities (in which a significant proportion of the buildings or landscape is under UNESCO protection), and university cities (in which academic or research institutions play a major role in the local community).
Despite having unfavourable conditions for undergoing a low-carbon transformation, we show how some (post)industrial cities (such as Gelsenkirchen and Oberhausen) have been able to adopt ambitious climate policies – although other comparable cities (e.g. Cottbus) lag much further behind. Results were also mixed for World Heritage cities such as Potsdam, Würzburg and Regensburg, which are limited in terms of the changes they can make to buildings or the local landscape but might nonetheless view sustainability as an additional tool to preserve monuments and attract tourists. In contrast, we found that university cities such as Bonn, Aachen, Rostock and Erlangen found it much easier to develop far-reaching climate policies, because they had more sympathetic populations and politicians, and could rely on support from the local research community.",Nottingham Trent University,Leibniz-Institute for Research on Society and Space,Åbo Akademi,,,,,,Nottingham Trent University,,Peter Eckersley,Wolfgang Haupt,Kristine Kern,,,,,,Peter Eckersley,,Local Government,Political Leadership,Climate Change,Comparative Perspective,,,,,"Which local factors shape low-carbon transformations in mid-sized cities?

0,"White supremacists  have long used digital communication to produce virtual communities where users can safely transgress normative injunctions against hate, racism, and white supremacy. More recently, they have been active on social media platforms that have a much broader set of users, often with the goal of radicalizing them, legitimising white supremacist ideas, and mainstreaming their narratives by eroding these injunctions. While social media platforms’ governance has provided little more than a light touch on white supremacy, content moderation and ‘deplatforming’ precipitates new dynamics in the process of digitally-mediated white supremacist group making. This paper takes two key concepts in media studies for the description of users connected by sociotechnical systems–virtual community and networked publics–to understand the forms of organization that white supremacists create online and the role that changing regimes of speech governance and technical affordances play in the form and process of group making. This paper looks critically at Stormfront, a long-running and infamous white supremacist web forum, and Twitter to illustrate changing dynamics in white supremacist digital group making. While the former produces a community, the latter offers opportunities for mainstreaming and normalisation of white supremacist ideas and narratives. Through this analysis, the paper proposes the concept of white racial projects, drawing on the sociology of racism, to understand how and why white supremacist users use and navigate different technical and social affordances. Finally, looking at Telegram and alt-tech platforms as sites to which these users have migrated following deplatforming actions, this paper argues that future research on digitally-mediated white supremacy ‘after deplatforming’ must contend more directly with questions of community and collective identity by focusing on boundary making and how virtual communities navigate a stack of platforms and technologies to realise white racial projects as content moderation and governance reconfigures the sociotechnical systems through which these projects unfold.",Rijksuniversiteit Groningen,,,,,,,,Rijksuniversiteit Groningen,,Bharath Ganesh,,,,,,,,Bharath Ganesh,,Extremism,Identity,Internet,,,,,,White supremacist projects between virtual communities and networked publics,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65547&EventID=185

Although the relationship between hegemons and international institutions is at the very heart of International Relations, the literature fails to account for why some international institutions are resilient after hegemonic withdrawal while others decay. To address this gap, this paper theoretically develops and empirically tests a theory of leadership transition after hegemonic withdrawal. I claim that if states or IO administrations are (1) willing to take the lead; (2) able to mobilize sufficient resources to sustain the institutional purpose; and (3) recognized by other member states, international institutions are resilient after hegemonic withdrawal.

0,"The relevance of “deservingness perceptions” is well established in research on public opinion towards social policy with typical hierarchies of groups widely perceived to be more (the elderly, families), less (the poor, the unemployed) or least deserving (immigrants). Previous studies often assumed this hierarchy to be stable, resulting in considerable inequalities in groups’ prospects of obtaining beneficial policy. Yet, we know surprisingly little about whether and how perceptions of groups’ deservingness vary at the individual level. How homogeneous or heterogeneous are citizens’ deservingness perceptions? And are these perceptions affected by individual characteristics, such as a citizen’s group belonging or ideology?

Drawing on research on ingroup favoritism and pocketbook voting, we argue that deservingness perceptions are less influenced by groups’ general social image than by individual respondents’ group belonging and ideology. Individuals perceive groups to whom they belong (ingroup) to be more deserving than outgroups. In addition, ideological beliefs are expected to shape deservingness perceptions. Thus, we argue that most variance occurs at the individual level, resulting in perceptions that are much more contested than the literature tends to claim. 

We draw on data gained through an online-survey fielded among German citizens of eligible voting age (approx. 5,600 respondents) in the last two weeks of the 2021 federal elections campaign. We explore deservingness perceptions with regard to 16 selected groups. Thereby, we extend previous research that has often focused on only a limited number of “needy” groups who are not the exclusive (and probably even not the primary) target of public policy, leaving aside relevant targets such as entrepreneurs, workers or the rich. We also go beyond the concept of perceived “welfare deservingness”, prevailing in the deservingness literature, to extend it to the question of which groups the government should do more or less for. The main finding of this study that social images of groups are much more complex and heterogeneous, than previously suggested, has crucial implications for our understanding of social dynamics, the voter-party-relation and (unequal) policy responsiveness.",Universität Stuttgart,Institut d'Études Politiques de Bordeaux,University of Trier,,,,,,Universität Stuttgart,,Elisa Deiss-Helbig,Isabelle Guinaudeau,Theres Matthieß,,,,,,Elisa Deiss-Helbig,,Social Welfare,Identity,Political Ideology,Public Opinion,,,,,Who deserves?

0,"Complex environmental issues, such as climate change or the loss of biodiversity, are only effectively addressed with policies and processes coordinated within and across diverse policy sectors. However, the integration of an issue across policy sectors constitutes a major challenge to governance and policy-making, as many policy decisions are traditionally taken in sectoral silos. To achieve integration into sectoral policies, the issue has to be addressed by actors within and across these silos. Little is known, however, about which actors are propel this process. We thus ask: Who drives policy integration? 

Building on the concept of mainstreaming, we analyze the integration of a cross-cutting issue into policies of 20 different policy sectors over a period of 20 years, focusing on the behavior of specific types of actors present in the policy process. Specifically, we look at which actors involved in the parliamentary process in Switzerland are integrating the issue of biodiversity into sectoral policies. We study members of parliament (MPs) and government departments, taking into account their degree of specialization in sectors and their general emphasis on the biodiversity issue.

We employ a quantitative approach by analyzing a comprehensive collection of documents introduced into the parliamentary process by either MPs or government departments, including parliamentary acts, transcripts, reports, draft laws, and others. We then use a combination of supervised text classification procedures to (1) classify all documents by their policy sector, (2) index the documents relevant to biodiversity. On the basis of the information thus obtained, we construct valued bipartite actor-sector networks in which actors are linked to sectors based on the number of documents relevant to biodiversity. To assess how certain actor attributes—namely issue specialization, sector specialization, and the actor type—increase the chance of tie formation, we eventually use a combination of descriptive and inferential network analysis (ERGMs).

We find that most biodiversity-related documents come from sector specialists who address the issue only occasionally, and typically not in more than two different sectors. Actors with an increased interest in the issue tend to produce more documents, which are also distributed across a larger number of different sectors. For an increased sector specialization, the opposite is the case. This pattern is evident for both MPs and federal departments. Therefore, while policy integration is driven by issue specialists, it is the sector specialists on whom it depends whether integration succeeds.

0,"The rapid spread of disinformation online poses a challenge for democratic societies. Defined as intentionally or knowingly false statements that are disseminated to reach a certain goal, disinformation raises concerns, such as increasingly misinformed and polarized societies or declining trust in traditional journalism. However, certain studies (e.g., Altay et al., 2021) argue that the prevalence and impact of disinformation might be overstated and vary among individuals. Despite the importance of this issue, our empirical understanding of the degree to which individuals are exposed to disinformation, remains limited. While some studies (e.g., Allcott & Gentzkow, 2017) provide evidence for an overall high (perceived) exposure to disinformation, studies relying on passive measurements (e.g., Guess et al., 2018) found that exposure to disinformation is low on average, but highly concentrated within specific groups. 
To address these diverging assessments, we introduce a novel approach to examine online disinformation exposure on the individual level and how it relates to individual characteristics and political attitudes which were identified as influential in this context by earlier research. While some of their findings are contradictory, earlier studies (e.g., Reuter et al., 2019) showed that demographic characteristics (i.e., age, gender, education) affect disinformation exposure. In line with the theory of selective exposure, we know that political attitudes determine information consumption and that it also affects exposure to disinformation (Guess et al., 2018). Following this theoretical argument, previous research that highlighted a conceptual affinity between populism and disinformation, and previous findings, we assume that populist radical-right (PRR) attitudes predict disinformation exposure online. Finally, a higher trust in non-traditional media which could result in a higher reliance on social media and right-wing alternative media for political information consumption is decisive, since recent studies (e.g., Guess et al., 2020) have highlighted the significant role of these platforms in the spread of disinformation. 
We combined survey and tracking data of German participants’ online information behavior using a tracking tool based on the screen-scraping approach (N = 594). To detect disinformation, we trained artificial neural network-based classifiers on a large corpus of disinformation (N = 861 disinformation items retrieved from Germanophone fact checking projects) and true information (3k news stories scraped from news websites). By applying the classifiers to the tracking data (N of web pages = 144,404) and manually verifying the classified items, we make two contributions: first, we provide an empirical assessment of actual exposure to disinformation in a multiparty European context, which goes beyond the usual focus on a US context. Second, we introduce an automated method for disinformation detection for Germanophone textual data.
Our findings revealed that exposure to disinformation was low on average and exposure to disinformation was highly concentrated, as only a small portion of users (18%) was exposed to disinformation online. Further, results from a zero-inflated Poisson regression showed that individuals with lower levels of education, stronger PRR attitudes, a higher trust in non-traditional media and a stronger reliance on social and right-wing alternative media were more likely to be exposed to more disinformation online.",Universität Koblenz-Landau,Koblenz-Landau Universität,Universität Bern,,,,,,Universität Koblenz-Landau,,Clara Christner,Teresa Gil Lopez,Mykola Makhortykh,,,,,,Clara Christner,,Europe (Central and Eastern),Media,Populism,Quantitative,Social Media,Communication,Public Opinion,Big Data,Who encounters disinformation online?

0,"Parliamentary debate is key to both representation and policymaking in democracies. This study examines how political party groups decide who speaks for them on specific issues. In many parliamentary systems, MPs are the spokesperson of a specific policy portfolio. They speak only on that issue and are primarily responsible for formulating and articulating their party’s position on that issue in parliament. We explore what criteria political parties use to decide which MPs serve as spokesperson on a specific issue.
The key concept in our paper is specialization: the assignment of spokespersonships is the outcome of a process of careful consideration for the party because they distribute and delegate decision-making and policymaking power on day-to-day business in parliament. We build on the literature on committee assignments, which points to informational, distributional and partisan rationales behind MP specialization. The informational rationale of a division of labour suggests that MPs become a spokesperson on the issues that they have specialist knowledge of. The distributional rationale predicts MPs to be the spokesperson on those issues for which they have ties to relevant groups outside parliament, such as voters and interest groups. Finally, according to the partisan rationale, parties will assign issue portfolios that the party leadership prioritizes to the more prominent MPs in the parliamentary party group.
We analyse a database of the parliamentary and pre-parliamentary careers of Danish MPs (2011 – 2019) which documents who holds each spokespersonship in each party.

0,"When a populist party controls a government, such as Law and Justice in Poland, some initiatives opposing populists are no longer viable, especially rights-restricting or ostracizing responses which require government intervention or target opposition parties. The Polish case shows that a ‘pincer movement’ model of opposition may nevertheless emerge, involving extensive and sometimes coordinated opposition from domestic and international actors against a governing populist party. This opposition can involve international rights-restricting initiatives, coupled with strategies of opposition using the instruments of normal politics. While we know a great deal about the inter-institutional dynamics of EU institutions and member states form the growing literature on the EU’s ‘rule of law crisis’, we know much less about how these international initiatives interact with opposition at home. In light of attention paid to cooperation between international and domestic actors in studies of democratization, this seems an important shortcoming. Using a case study of opposition to judicial reforms in Poland, the article examines how and why domestic civil society actors use linkages with international actors to exert pressure on populists in power. As the Polish case is pioneering in many aspects, we use the inductive approach to study the phenomenon of internationalization of domestic responses to populists in power.

This dilemma is particularly relevant when there is an alternation of power with the arrival of a new political elite with preferences different from those of the predecessor government. The main objective of the research was the development of an experimental analysis in order to explore the hypothesis that Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA) could be perceived by public servants of the agencies as a tool to protect their interests against the risk of potential external interference in its activities, in particular the government. The methodological strategy adopted was to apply an experimental survey with the agencies’ career servants. The randomized experiment had two treatment groups (with and without a manipulation of political interference) and a control group (no manipulation). A total of 104 questionnaire responses were received from six regulatory agencies in Brazil. The survey results reveal that, despite the mandatory nature of the AIR, when civil servants perceive that the regulatory agency would be under threat of executive interference, civil servants use it as a mechanism to protect their preferences. The overwhelming majority of respondents were in favor of using the RIA and see this instrument as a shield against potential external interference in the performance of the agencies, especially with regard to the risks of non-continuity of the terms in office of directors appointed by previous governments.",Getulio Vargas Foundation,Getulio Vargas Foundation,,,,,,,Getulio Vargas Foundation,,Carlos Pereira,Erico Santos,,,,,,,Erico Santos,,Regulation,Developing World Politics,Comparative Perspective,,,,,,Who needs AIR?

0,"What are citizens’ attitudes towards the selection of justices to Supreme and Constitutional Courts regarding the institutional process and individual traits of candidates?
 
While justices to highest courts are not publicly elected, their legitimacy depends on how contentious the change of personnel is perceived and who will be selected. Perceived legitimacy matters a great deal because highest courts frequently make decisions with political implications and use their public support as currency to make politicians implementing their decisions. We are the first to provide systematic comparative evidence regarding the public’s preferred selection process as well as the “ideal” candidate for the bench using a most different systems design.
 
To do so we conducted a discrete choice experiment embedded in high-quality panel survey instruments in France and Germany. Respondents were asked to choose between randomized characteristics of hypothetical candidates and selection processes. Additionally, we reevaluate data from similar survey experiments conducted in the United States. Our results identify a seemingly common normative ideal that citizens have in mind with regard to the institutional selection and the characteristics of justices they prefer to be selected to highest courts. Citizens prefer professional judicial experts who are selected by parliament or by non-political experts rather than the executive branch.

This paper investigates the extent to which regulatory agencies are autonomous from corporate interests as well as the determinants of agencies’ informal autonomy in the context of internet governance. To this end, it uses a mixed-methods approach combining quantitative analysis of twelve global internet agencies and eleven interviews with senior officials of these agencies. The findings primarily suggest that informal autonomy from private interests is determined by the complexity of the policies developed by the agency (where more complex policies weaken autonomy), the level of media attention accorded to the agency (which increases autonomy), and the agency’s age (which weakens autonomy). Assessing autonomy from corporate interests is of crucial importance for overcoming the democratic deficits of global forms of governance (Take 2012; Ewert et al. 2018).

0,"Turkey is currently hosting the largest number of urban refugees in the world. Around 4 million refugees in total live in non-camp, urban spaces in Turkey. In the absence of a national integration policy, many municipalities go an extra mile to accommodate refugees, taking the risk of following a divergent path from their political parties’ responses to the crisis in question. This provides a novel case through which to study the formation of unique local responses to migration in highly centralized authoritarian state structures. Using 76 structured interviews and an original survey with 268 local municipal bureaucrats, this paper finds that the decision to introduce municipal social services for refugees at the local level is largely made by mid-level bureaucrats at local municipalities who work closely with a diverse group of stakeholders including the mayor, constituents, local civil society organizations, political parties, and refugees. Whereas contrary to the literature on bureaucratic incorporation of immigrants and refugees, I argue that municipal accommodation does not always emanate from altruistic motivations and/or professional duty to serve persons in need. In fact, municipal staff often incorporate refugees into municipal social services not because they perceive them as “deserving”, but for political motives.

0,"When and how do ordinary citizens gain substantial control over important collective decisions affecting their lives? This book provides new answers to that question by systematically accumulating evidence in novel ways. This comparative review of participatory budgeting reveals the factors behind its success and failures in achieving democratic engagement. The book describes the application of Qualitative Comparative Analysis to systematically accumulate evidence to when citizens gain control over important collective decisions in Participatory Budgeting. 
Analysis shows that popular claims that there are several single necessary conditions for citizens to gain such control over collective decisions have been imprudent. Nevertheless, a political leadership committed to participation is almost always required for sustained citizen control of political decisions over the longer term. There is evidence that these good outcomes only occur where those willing leaders can rely on strong support and competence from administrative staff, or alternatively where participatory leaders have strong fiscal independence. Perhaps controversially, the evidence for the importance of civil society conditions, which have played a strong role in theories of successful citizen participation, is mixed. The relevance afforded civil society in explanation depends on the level of uncertainty that researchers are willing to accept in their theories and reveals issues of conceptualisation of civil society roles in participatory programmes.

0,"The paper will study what market incentives motivate energy companies to accept a larger role of public actors in regulating their market and/or provide costly public goods on their own. Private public governance research frequently posits societal, e.g. transnational, pressure as a necessary condition for public good provision by private firms. Less research, however, has looked into the possibilities of private public governance when social pressure is absent. The paper aims to amend this gap by analysing the company reports of BP and Shell - including their predecessor companies - throughout the 2nd half of the 20th century. In this, it will test the hypotheses that a positive position to public governance primarily results from a company's declining market position. The paper will also argue that an entrepreneurial role understanding of leading managers is an important intervening factor. Despite its obvious limitations, the BP and Shell sample is a good fit  for such a study since it controls for the crucial factor of home state socialisation and management culture, with both companies having at least strong roots in the UK. Both companies also offer a complete time series of company reports for analysis.

0,"Why do armed conflicts last so long? The answer to these questions is of utmost importance not just for humanitarian reasons but also for the development of a country. However, the analysis of armed conflicts using traditional empirical tools is challenging. Statistical methods that assume independence do not capture the system's interdependence. Conflicts are better analysed as processes of interaction. In this paper, I present an approach that can answer this need. I study the Colombian conflict through a network analysis framework. Network analysis methods can capture the interdependence of dynamic systems. This approach provides better representations of armed conflicts.

I use a relational event model to study interaction mechanisms between armed groups and their influence on the direction of the armed conflict. I use the Colombian conflict as it is a ripe example of a chronic conflict. I find inertia - the tendency to attack, and retaliation - the tendency to reciprocate an attack - influence the persistence of the Colombian conflict. Furthermore, I find that inertia has a stronger influence than retaliation. I also find that recent events have a stronger influence than past events in future attacks. Thus, I conclude that the armed conflict in Colombia is an offensive rather than a defensive dispute. This information has implications on policies for de-escalating conflict and preventing a relapse.",University of Exeter,,,,,,,,University of Exeter,,LAURA ROLDAN,,,,,,,,LAURA ROLDAN,,Conflict,Latin America,Developing World Politics,Methods,Quantitative,,,,Why do armed conflicts last so long?

0,"Committee work lies at the core of parliamentary activities in representative democracies. So far, various strands of literature have investigated the activities of these committees, why some parliamentarians join committees and what happens as a result of the activities in these committees. In spite of this broad coverage, there is limited research on parliamentary committee switching. More precisely, only isolated studies sought to explain why parliamentarians leave the committee in which they started their activity to join another. This paper seeks to address this gap in the literature and aims to explain what drives Members of the Romanian Chamber of Deputies to switch parliamentary committees. The timeframe for analysis is 2012-2020, which coincides with almost two full terms in office. This timeframe also allows a comparison between the parliamentarians elected under the mixed-member proportional system used in 2012 and those elected under closed list proportional representation in 2016. To explain switching between parliamentary committees, our analysis includes all deputies in the two legislatures, thus comparing switchers and non-switchers. Our study focuses on individual level explanations such as parliamentary experience, activity as a legislator, position in the party, expertise, political rewards, committee size, visibility and partisan affiliation. To analyze the explanatory power of these determinants, our statistical analysis uses individual level data from approximately 550 parliamentarians. The results indicate that switching is a function of expertise and political experience, moderated by the visibility of the new committee.",University of Glasgow,Babeş-Bolyai University,,,,,,,University of Glasgow,,Sergiu Gherghina,Claudiu Marian,,,,,,,Sergiu Gherghina,,Democracy,Elections,Candidate,,,,,,Why Do Parliamentarians Switch Committees?

0,"At a moment of great uncertainty in Europe for established centre-left and centre-right parties characterised by falling membership and shrinking electoral support, this paper investigates the organisations of populist radical right parties (PRRPs), i.e. the party family that has been at the forefront of challenging the so-called “mainstream”. While parties are often seen to adopt increasingly light models of party organisation which are relatively cheap to run, several PRRPs remain committed to maintaining costly and complex mass organisations (Heinisch and Mazzoleni 2016; Albertazzi and Van Kessel 2021). Through these, they foster constant interaction between party elites, members and sympathisers, and create communities of loyal partisan activists.
Drawing on the analysis of circa 100 interviews with party representatives from four European PRRPs (the League, the Finns Party, Flemish Interest and the Swiss People’s Party) we ask “what’s in it” for PRRPs that still invest in large organisations, allowing for rootedness, activism and participation. Our main focus is discussing why PPRP elites invest in mass party organisations, and analysing how they seek to preserve collective identities through ideology. Ultimately, the paper challenges the still-prevailing assumption that PRRPs tend to have an underdeveloped party organisation and heavily rely on charismatic leadership for their success. By arguing that the PRRPs’ creation and fostering of closed communities of political activists can lend credence to their populist claim that they are of, and for, ordinary people, the paper brings to the fore the extent to which organisational choices can themselves be revealed to be “ideological products” (Scarrow, 2015).","Queen Mary, University of London",University of Birmingham,,,,,,,"Queen Mary, University of London",,Stijn van Kessel,Daniele Albertazzi,,,,,,,Stijn van Kessel,,Democracy,Extremism,Political Parties,Populism,,,,,Why do party elites preserve the “mass party”?

0,"A large literature in International Relations discusses the conditions of state compliance with international institutions. Despite the growing importance and influence of international organizations (IOs) in world politics, IOs seldom wield such powers as to force states into compliance with their decisions. Rather, they use more subtle institutional instruments and practices to incentivize states. In that regard, the relevant literature theorizes that IOs will be more likely to elicit compliance when they regularly produce and provide knowledge, monitor compliance, specify credible enforcement mechanisms, and ensure fairness in their decision-making procedures. With respect to information, it has been argued that the generation and exchange of reliable evidence about other states’ compliance as well as expert knowledge about the IOs’ substantive governance tasks produce unique benefits to states. In addition, it has long been argued that IOs can deter noncompliant behavior by codifying and implementing formal sanctioning mechanisms, which often range from naming and shaming practices to the imposition of financial and economic fines. Finally, a growing body of IO research proposes that the perceived legitimacy of IO procedures and practices is a central factor in eliciting compliance, even more so when the IO’s informational and enforcement functions are weak. 
However, less is known about the relative effects of knowledge, monitoring, enforcement, and legitimacy and how they might interact to produce more compliance or less compliance with IO rules and policies. This paper therefore investigates these questions in an experimental setting that offers the opportunity to avoid important inferential pitfalls. The design of IOs and hence their capacity to affect state incentives is not random but tied to a series of observable (e.g., issue area, cooperation problems) and unobservable factors that often risk to bias analyses of institutional effects. To overcome these important endogeneity concerns, we design and implement a survey experiment. We can thus examine the causal link between key institutional features of IOs, relating to knowledge production, enforcement, and legitimacy, and the extent to which they individually, or in combination, affect state compliance. 
The experiment is embedded in a survey asking 1000 IO staff members about their assessments and perceptions of the state and future of global governance. The survey was fielded in 2021. Respondents have been drawn from a sample of 30 international organizations from different substantive issue areas (security, trade, development, finance, migration, climate change) in world politics. Surveying IO staff is particularly relevant as these hold special knowledge and insights into the workings of their IOs and state behavior within these. The experimental question has four binary treatments related to an IO’s epistemic practices (1), compliance monitoring (2), sanctioning procedures (3), and the fairness of decision making (4). This yields in total 16 different combinations of institutional design features which are randomly assigned to participants. The dependent variable measures the extent to which IO officials believe that a certain combination of institutional features and practices elicits more compliance or less compliance.",WZB Berlin Social Science Center,University of Reading,WZB Berlin Social Science Center,,,,,,WZB Berlin Social Science Center,,Alexandros Tokhi,Martin Binder,İrem Tuncer-Ebetürk,,,,,,Alexandros Tokhi,,International Relations,State Power,Survey Experiments,,,,,,Why Do States Comply With International Institutions?

0,"Climate assemblies and juries are a relatively recent phenomenon. As such, much of the commentary and analysis – whether theoretical or empirical – tends to be rather simplistic, too quick to generalise about what are complex processes. True, they share strong family resemblances across fundamental characteristics: e.g., remit, mode of recruitment, facilitated learning, deliberation and decision making. But to generalise from these core features is to do a disservice to the phenomenon. For example, simply considering the French Citizens’ Convention on Climate and the UK Climate Assembly which were the first two examples of national level initiatives indicates significant differences in terms of their commissioning and coupling to governing institutions, governance, the expectations placed on members in terms of policy development or appraisal, the autonomy afforded members in terms of engagement with outside interest and media, etc. More recent initiatives, for example, the German Citizens’ Assembly on Climate commissioned by civil society organisations and Finland’ Citizens’ Jury on Climate Actions that lasted only three days and assessed government policy proposals further stretch the idea that citizens’ assemblies and juries can be treated as a singular phenomenon. This paper is a first step in unpacking the phenomenon, analysing critical dimensions of climate assembly and jury practice where sensitive comparative analysis is necessary. This will encompass an analysis of both internal (e.g., approach to facilitation; the nature of member/expert interface) and external (e.g., type of linkage with public authorities) characteristics. An appreciation of the complexity of climate assembly and jury practice will make for more rigorous and meaningful social scientific analysis of these democratic innovations and a clearer understanding of the conditions under which they might contribute to democratic renewal and enhanced climate governance.",University of Westminster,,,,,,,,University of Westminster,,Graham Smith,,,,,,,,Graham Smith,,Democracy,Environmental Policy,Governance,Political Participation,Climate Change,,,,Why generalising about climate assemblies and juries is not so simple,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64043&EventID=185

However, most of this work is constrained by the availability of data, and its deductive nature – with explanatory factors often based on normative work that made assumptions in the mid XXth century.

0,"Why Not? – Explaining Youth Non-Participation Among Sympathizers of Hong Kong’s 2019 Protest Movement

Anna J. Fiedler & Frank Reichert, The University of Hong Kong

Abstract

Over the last two decades, youth-led protests have increased. Compared to older cohorts, young people face fewer time constraints and familial obligations and are more likely to engage in protest activities. At the same time, youth face more barriers to civic engagement than older cohorts and more commonly participate in informal modes of participation. However, whereas youth mobilization has been widely examined, why some youth participate while others remain on the sidelines has not been adequately explored and remains not well understood. In 2019, opposition to an extradition bill amendment led to unprecedented mass demonstrations, riots, and electoral turnout in Hong Kong. Young people were among the largest and most engaged participant groups during the movement. Yet even though protest action became a part of daily life on campuses during this city-wide crisis, some students who sympathized with the movement did not become active supporters. This paper examines reasons for non-participation using survey and interview data from undergraduate students. In particular, this study analyzes possible causes for the non-conversion of sympathizers into participants and the erosion of protest participants. The analysis also explores differences among students of different origins. The findings show that non-participation was not merely a result of the ineffective mobilization of otherwise highly sympathetic individuals. Instead, perceived (in)effectiveness, identity conflicts, and barriers played an important role in students’ decisions not to participate in protest action. The findings further our understanding of non-participation and are discussed regarding students’ networks and the implications for culturally diverse societies.",The University of Hong Kong,The University of Hong Kong,,,,,,,The University of Hong Kong,,Anna Fiedler,Frank Reichert,,,,,,,Frank Reichert,,Citizenship,Political Participation,Activism,Youth,,,,,Why Not? – Explaining Youth Non-Participation Among Sympathizers of Hong Kong’s 2019 Protest Movement,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64427&EventID=185
0,"The world financial crisis brought to the fore two phenomena – the growth of economic populism and the rise of the so-called emerging powers. Among these new powers, Russia and China positioned themselves as additions to the existing system of Brettonwood organizations. As a result, part of the populist parties became attracted by these new powers. In central Europe, the relationship between populist parties and the emerging powers expressed itself in close relations between Orban’s Hungary and Putin’s Russia, while in Poland the anti-Russian long-term sentiment did not allow to move closer to Putin, but the country’s leadership is making some steps towards China. Additionally, the vaccine diplomacy appealed especially to the” pragmatic” leaders such as Orban or Zeman. Despite often only moderate results (Chinese investment, failure to deliver contracted volumes of vaccines), they still stress the pragmatism of this orientation. 
In this context, the Czech Republic represents a special case of the country, where president Zeman is regarded as a pro-Russian and pro-Chinese politician, while the former Prime Minister Andrej Babiš, was ostensibly not interested in foreign policies. The paper, therefore, explores the mutual attraction of economic populism and the Russian and Chinese capital in the Czech Republic.

0,"Political theorists working on populism frequently note an aversion to compromise on the part of populists. The negative relationship between populism and compromise is presupposed in their studies, but is rarely analyzed in detail (Abts and Rummens 2007, Urbinati 2019, Pappas 2019, Mudde 2021). In this paper, we offer a comprehensive and systematic account of the reasons behind this oft-repeated conflict between the populist ideology and the practice of compromise, disentangling the various dimensions of such incompatibility and exploring their connections. We seek thus to identify what is distinctive about populist objections, bearing in mind that they are not the only ones to vehemently oppose compromises in politics. To do so, we rely on major recent theoretical works on populism, on empirical findings concerning the ideational approach to this phenomenon, and on Baume and Papadopoulos’s (2022) typology of objections against political compromises that singled out five general grievances to compromise. The paper shows that the populist objections partly overlap with those inventoried by Baume and Papadopoulos, notably along the moral and antagonistic dimensions. However, the pluralist objection is completely reversed, since populists criticize compromises for undermining the people’s political homogeneity. As to the objections of inconsistency and inequality, which also appear in Baume and Papadopoulos’s (2022) typology, we find that they are marginal in the populist corpus.",Université de Lausanne,Université de Lausanne,,,,,,,Université de Lausanne,,Sandrine Baume,Yannis Papadopoulos,,,,,,,Sandrine Baume,,Conflict,Democracy,Decision Making,Normative Theory,,,,,Why so much Hatred?

0,"The term ʻsolidarityʼ has undoubtedly become a battle cry in political discourse during the Covid-19 pandemic. In view of the global challenges, solidarity was called for to ensure the protection of human lives and to limit the social, cultural and economic damage. But the credo ""We have to be in solidarity!"" can only be understood if we assume, in an egalitarian sense, a shared responsibility towards global problems that is nourished by empathy and fellow humanity (Gould 2007, p. 155; Fine 2018). However, such a cosmopolitan norm of solidarity seems to simply overwhelm the moral capacity to act of most people. After all, and in the face of ongoing economic, social, ecological, and humanitarian crises, the global lack of solidarity can hardly be explained otherwise (Liedman 2020). Solidarity remains determined by an irrevocable particularism that ties the willingness to grant it to common material and substantial living conditions, beliefs, values, feelings of belonging and thus a collective identity (Bayertz 1998, pp. 11, 49). Accordingly, the question is not only why to be in solidarity at all but with whom?
	Not just under late modern conditions of a radically de-traditionalized and pluralized world, it has to be taken into account that solidarity, as an expectation or mere possibility (Helfritzsch 2020, p. 239), is always in historical, theoretical and methodological crisis itself (Dallinger 2009). For Émile Durkheim, solidarity, just like identity, nevertheless remains a social fact that does not simply disappear in the context of social upheavals and experiences of inequality. Instead, corresponding ideas adapt to changed structures, a social interest of society towards the individual and practical reason regarding the organization of social coexistence. As part of the polarization tendencies currently observed in Western societies, identity conflicts always deal with the social tension between the individual and the collective. 
Although the differences in economic, social and cultural livelihoods have unquestionably increased in the wake of the pandemic, altered structures and dependencies of late-modern societies are the result of long-term developments. My contribution seeks to trace these changes with respect to questions of solidarity and (collective) identity in the tension between collectivism and singularization. The focus is on adjustments from a mechanical to an organic solidarity (Durkheim [1930] 1988), from a solidarity out of need to a solidarity out of fear (Beck 1992), and the current conflict between hyperculture and cultural essentialism (Reckwitz 2020). I argue that the dichotomous juxtaposition of two poles of identity (Merkel 2017; Fukuyama 2018; Reckwitz 2020,), contributes to the perpetuation of inequalities and paradoxes, because it further entrenches the competition between 'winners' and 'losers' in late modern societies. If the realization of one's own goals, interests and identity can only be achieved at the expense of others, the common basis for social solidarity disappears. And if different camps are no longer able to overcome their partiality for the sake of a future commonality (Habermas 1995, p. 221), societies inevitably run the risk of developing new communities of solidarity from within.",University of Rostock / ICU Tokyo,,,,,,,,University of Rostock / ICU Tokyo,,Dennis Bastian Rudolf,,,,,,,,Dennis Bastian Rudolf,,Cleavages,Political Theory,Identity,Solidarity,,,,,Why to be in solidarity at all?

0,"Peacekeeping missions following the notions of security sector governance- and reform (SSG/R), as stipulated in the UN Resolution 2553 (2020) e.g., ideally adhere to the SSG/R most fundamental approach, the local ownership. Basically local ownership means that SSR-measures in a respective country are first and foremost devised and implemented by local actors and not by external actors. The role of external actors, such as SSR-programme officers of the UN-Missions, is merely to support the respective local actors in their endeavour.    
Yet, external actors are, intentionally or unintentionally, trying to affect the SSR-processes with their respective normative ideas and perceptions on an informal level. Since the external actors are everything else than homogenous but a heterogeneous actor group with most differing ideas, there are rivalling- and even contradicting concepts of reform measures in place. Since the imposition of alien concepts in peacebuilding- and SSR-contexts failed, as existing research suggests, the success of influencing the locally driven reform process mostly depends on negotiation. 
Based on several extended research stays, ethnographic research and qualitative interviews with local and international actors concerned with security governance in Timor-Leste, this paper looks on the micro level of everyday peacekeeping.

0,"The object of research which is presented in this paper is the state violence directed against women which is defined as the use of governmental authority to cause unnecessary harm and suffering to groups and individuals. In post-electoral Belarus, questions regarding input legitimacy of governmental authority are purely rhetorical.  

We argue that repressive reactions to post-electoral protest movements paved innovative ways of gendered protests in Belarus. As women engaged more daringly into the protest actions, the complexity of local and central actors and institutions, collaborating in production of the “state violence” became more perceptible. Within the process of political violence and variable usage of repressive practices, the state itself has been transformed, as its output legitimacy and political institutions suffered. Meanwhile, social authority of oppositional leaders (most are imprisoned or live in exile), and protest activities are sustained among parts of Belarusian population (including Belarusians abroad), newly and painfully sensitized to gendered state-building practices. 

The 2020 presidential election and subsequent protests in Belarus challenged the apparent stability of the non-democratic regime (Moshes, Nizhnikau 2021). Different social groups took part in the intensive domestic protests in August – November 2020 when it was suppressed by harsh repressions. Women of different age, professional occupation, and income form one of such protest groups in Belarus. Since late 2021, female activists, on the one hand, continue to perform a wide range of political-civic activities. On the other, they themselves became a target of repressions. We analyze two types of repressions which are: a) focused on individual women, b) aimed at their family-members (children). As for February 2022, there are around 150 female political prisoners in Belarus which is a big number as such, although it makes a smaller share within the total amount of more than 1000 political prisoners.

Female political activism in Belarus raise questions regarding the role of women in protest mobilization and invite reflection on patterns of violent and repressive reactions of the authorities towards it. What are the main reasons of female mobilization in Belarusian protests? How authoritarian authorities react towards female protest activities? Which specific repressive practices and forms of violence do they use towards women-rebels? 

The ideological grounds and instruments of repressive practices directed at women-rebels deserve a comprehensive analysis. This empirical observation driven study aims to analyze the tools and content of these targeted repressions. The presentation is based on the results from field research (a series of semi-structured interviews) with the Belarusian female activists, participant observation of the authors and analysis of data regarding state violence from available databases and datasets. 

Firstly, we make an overview of the female agency in the pro-democratic protests and post-electoral period in Belarus. Then we provide insights from the previous research concerning the practices of state-instigated gendered violence against female activists. In the second part, we investigate women’s protest activities in Belarus and reflect on their tools and content.

0,"Although the global norm of transitional justice is localized in national parliaments, scholars have overlooked how female legislators shape national transitional justice policy-making. Instead, the importance of women’s agency in shaping transitional justice processes has been based on the study of women’s civil society activism. This paper extends the understanding of women’s contribution to transitional justice by conducting a multi-modal discourse analysis of parliamentary questions about transitional justice asked by male and female members of the Croatian Parliament from 2004 to 2020. The paper investigates whether female legislators are marginalized by the adversarial nature of parliamentary discourse, considering women’s preference for cooperative discourse, as sociolinguists have argued. Quantitative analysis of the interactional dimension of parliamentary questions shows that women’s questions are as adversarial as men’s questions. Also, qualitative analysis of discourse demonstrates that female legislators broaden the scope of entitlements and press for the right to reparations to both male and female victims of violence. They overcome constraints posed by ideology and partisanship, although the constraints of nationalism appear most difficult to transcend.

0,"The design and implementation of transitional justice mechanisms have increasingly become key factors in both peacebuilding initiatives and post-authoritarian transitions. From Argentina and Spain to Poland and Ukraine, organized labor has often been persecuted and victimized by authoritarian regimes, security forces, and warlords. Moreover, trade unions have played a decisive role in human rights mobilizations and democratization processes, given the significant membership base and societal status of these organizations in many of these contexts. Yet the literature on their role in transitional settings is fragmentary and surprisingly limited. Accordingly, this paper explores how and to what extent labor unions have been involved in the legal, socio-economic, and political processes undertaken in transitional justice experiences. Have workers’ organizations been represented in peace negotiations, truth commissions, and government coalitions? Have workers had any role in the design of transitional justice mechanisms? How has their role evolved over time? How workers’ organizations interacted with their condition of victims? How have they adapted to policies and discourses concerning (neo)liberal and democratic regimes that emerged in the aftermath of the Cold War?

0,"The manual working class is under pressure from digitalization and technical innovation that threatens to make their competence superfluous. At the same time, open borders and cultural integration lay the foundations for a tougher and more competitive work market for citizens lacking specialized skills or higher education. Thus, growing societal discontent has to a large degree been attributed to the native working class and their fight for a “nostalgic” version of the “old” and traditional society. Anti-immigrant attitudes are considered a constitutive part of this fight. To which degree exclusionist positions are caused by economic self-interest, sociotropic concerns or socio-cultural value characteristics, however, remains elusive. Existing research on working class discontent and anti-immigration attitudes investigate cultural and economic threats in detailed and systematic manners, primarily through cognitive evaluations of the economic or societal situation. It is thus difficult to know if respondents actually feel threatened and the potential connection between negative emotions and anti- immigrant attitudes. In the present study we utilize data from the Norwegian Election survey 2017 to investigate if negative emotions toward the general societal development generate anti-immigration attitudes among manual workers. The major aims are to examine; (1) if societal fear and anger breed anti-immigration attitudes, (2) if the manual working class obtains more negative emotions than other social classes, and (3) if the connection between negative societal emotions and anti-immigrant attitudes is stronger in this class than other classes.",Universitetet i Oslo,Universitetet i Oslo,,,,,,,Universitetet i Oslo,,Sara Hagfors,Tor Gaute Syrstad,,,,,,,Tor Gaute Syrstad,,Civil Society,Political Psychology,Social Capital,Identity,Immigration,Technology,Political Cultures,,Working class fear and anti-immigrant attitudes in Norway,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65267&EventID=185
0,"The global transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy and rising social inequities are two trends at the forefront of the political agenda in many countries today. In the past years, scholars have explored the connections between these trends, identifying the ‘energy justice’ concerns of energy transitions in distinct global contexts. Surprisingly, empirical evidence in this new body of work suggests that the current directionality of the global energy transition may lead to unjust outcomes and further exacerbate social inequities. Hence, an important issue that now emerges in academic debates is how, proactively, societal groups can work to align investments in the energy transition with processes and outcomes that are equitable, inclusive, and fair. In this paper we suggest taking a discursive approach to this problem by following how actors can challenge and ‘recode’ the governance of energy infra through the performance of energy justice discourses. Theoretically, we build upon our recent conceptualization of three related domains of ‘institutional work’ in the alignment of energy transitions and social justice, which allows researchers to investigate the processes of conflict, contestation and stabilization through which discourses become ‘coded’ in rules and arrangements guiding energy transitions. Empirically, we contrast four cases from the Netherlands of contestations of justice concerns surrounding the i) natural gas distraction in the province of Groningen in relationship to its negative side effects (earthquakes), ii) the natural gas-free neighborhood program of the national government, iii) co-siting of wind parks and datacenters, and iv) the zip code regulation for community energy. In these cases, diverse energy justice discourses are articulated, contested, and eventually inscribed in policy arrangements. The paper traces how these processes unfold. It identifies mechanisms about the ‘successes’ and ‘failures’ of such discursive dynamics; that is, in the way in which they may ‘bolster’ just outcomes, for example by underpinning lobbying power for decentralized communities, or by ‘evaporating’ this potential.",University of Utrecht,,,,,,,,University of Utrecht,,Jesse Hoffman,,,,,,,,Jesse Hoffman,,Energy Policy,Policy-Making,Transitional justice,,,,,,Working to align energy transitions and social justice in the Netherlands,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65047&EventID=185

Humanitarian Action masters programme, like many other applied, multidisciplinary programmes, attracts students from diverse backgrounds with varying level of knowledge, expertise, and appetite for critical thinking. Building student competencies to be able to link state-of-the-art world politics theory to improve contemporary humanitarian practice can be a formidable challenge in university classroom settings.

0,"The aim of this paper deals with the relations between national political parties and their counterparts at the European Union level. Party politics at the European Union (EU) level is characterized by the presence of three main party actors and by the relations and interactions among them. They are the Political Groups in the European Parliament (EPPGs), the European Political Parties (EuPPs) and the national parties of the Member States (MS) of the EU, which represent the “three faces” of the EU party politics (Katz, Mair 1993; Bardi 2005). The first two faces are still weaker than their national counterparts (Calossi, Cicchi 2018). The EPPGs and EUPPs retain organizational characteristics - such as the lack of direct contact with voters, the functional and legal autonomy of the different faces of the party and the dependence on state funds – which are typical to cartel parties. Due to these shortcomings, EPPGs and EuPPs cannot perform some of the typical functions of political parties, such as structuring of the vote, articulation of interests, political communication and socialization, selection of the political personnel: for these aspects, they rely on national parties. Obviously, the UE faces can vice versa furnish to national parties with some assets they would hardly obtain elsewhere. In fact, EPPGs and EUPPs have direct contacts with the EU institutions, are able to coordinate the multinational electoral campaigns and the EP parliamentarians and, in some cases, can also provide top-down political legitimacy to national parties. The latter function is useful for newly born national parties or parties with little legitimacy within their own national political system. Furthermore, the EU party actors help also to legitimize parties coming from new member states or from EU candidate countries (Cianciara 2016). Therefore, the relations between the EU faces of party politics and the national parties are crucial to understand the real functioning of party politics in the EU. The literature has studied many cases of affiliation (and disaffiliation) of national parties to their EU counterparts (von dem Berge, Poguntke 2012; Wientzek 2019; Gherghina, von dem Berge 2018; Chryssogelos 2017; Mikucka-Wójtowicz 2016), but most of this work focuses on specific geographical areas of Europe or on MS from the recent enlargements. A comprehensive approach on why, when and how national parties join or leave the party actors at EU level is still missing. The different ways in which national parties approach their EU counterparts may also be strongly influenced by the context, especially when new crises, such as the financial crisis or the Covid19 pandemic, arise. This paper aims to provide an interpretative framework of the relationships between national and EU parties, starting from the reconstruction of the events that characterized the affiliation of the various national parties to their European referents. Valuable sources of this will be official records of the EU-level and national parties, newspapers and the secondary literature. Consequently, I will investigate the incentives and the deterrents that facilitate or prevent national parties from joining the EPPGs and the EuPPs.",Università di Pisa,,,,,,,,Università di Pisa,,Enrico Calossi,,,,,,,,Enrico Calossi,,Democracy,European Politics,European Union,Integration,Political Competition,Political Parties,European Parliament,,You can tell someone by the company they keep.

Although the most visible forms of PRR international cooperation have occurred at European Parliament level, and/or between senior party leaders, there have also been repeated efforts by PRR youth wing elites across Europe and beyond to establish lasting links. However, beyond occasional media reports, we know very little about which youth wings cooperate, what it entails, and why it happens.

0,"This paper aims to provide an overview of academic work on the ordinary relationship of citizens of the Member States to the European Union with a specific focus on the students and the process of (de)politicization of European Union. 
What is the ordinary relationship between individuals and the European Union? What does Europe mean to them, professionally, politically or socially? How do these relationships vary between countries, social groups and generations? What characterises the more elitist relationships to this transnational space of government? These reflections are the subject of a long-standing concern of the European institutions themselves (Bréchon and Cautrès, 1998), seeking on the one hand signs of popular and shared support for the strengthening of European construction, and on the other hand the effects of their communication policy aimed at the general public (Aldrin, 2010, 2011; Belot et al., 2016). Over the last decade, a large number of qualitative studies have emerged, notably in response to the so-called crisis of legitimacy of the EU (Rohrschneider and Loveless, 2010), and to the major enlargement (Ruis Jimenez et al., 2004). On the one hand, they sought to question the concepts on which to base an analysis of the relationship between citizens and the EU - European 'identity' (Duchesne, 2010), European 'citizenship' (Favell, 2008). On the other hand, they have also been interested in qualitative survey techniques that make it possible to grasp the different dimensions of the relationship between European citizens and the EU, the processes through which this relationship is constructed (Belot and Bouillaud, 2008; Michel and Robert, 2010), and its determining factors, particularly national (Diez Medrano, 2003) and social (Fliegstein, 2008; Duchesne et al, 2010). Among these, a series of studies have combined semi or non-directive interviews with other techniques such as focus groups (Duchesne and Haegel, 2004; Duchesne and Ingelgom, 2008). In line with studies focusing on the ordinary relationship to politics (Buton et al., 2016), the work of Gaxie et al. (2011) used this type of data to highlight the tools and resources mobilised by 'ordinary' citizens to build their relationship with Europe and their social determinants. 
In this paper, this academic litterature will be put into perspective with the first results of a focus group survey of students. We hypothesise that this population is particularly interesting for two reasons: it is a population in which a very wide variety of relationships to Europe can be observed (from the most distant to the most elitist/expert, from the most critic to the most enthusiast) (Mercenier, 2019). It is also a population for which the EU has targeted specific policies, including the famous Erasmus programme, in the hope, among other things, that it will promote positive/favourable attitudes to European integration (King et Ruiz‐Gelices, 2003 ; Close, 2011).",Université Lyon II,Université Lyon II,,,,,,,Université Lyon II,,Willy Beauvallet,Cécile Robert,,,,,,,Willy Beauvallet,,Democracy,European Union,Political Participation,Youth,,,,,Young people/students and Europe.

0,"With Brexit and the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak, the UK and Europe find themselves in the midst of a profound moment of political, economic and generational uncertainty (Susen, 2017) (Oliver, 2018). Young people under 30 years of age have been members of the European Union their entire lives (Mejias & Banaji, 2017) and now experience the detachment of the UK from the EU. The process of leaving the EU is fundamentally changing the nature of their relationships with their European counterparts, and the economic, social, and political outcomes of Brexit will have the greatest consequences for the youngest and future generations (Mejias & Banaji, 2017, p. 5). In the middle of this uncertainty, young people are expected to make identity choices and reshape their sense of belonging to groups and societies (Beck, 1992; Giddens, 1990). The current research contributes to the study of European politics, sociology and cultural studies and furthers our understanding on the social construction of political identities among young people during the COVID-19 era. This research is exploring how young people in Athens and London articulate the European identity after Brexit during a global pandemic. A growing amount of literature has been produced by social scientists to try and assess the absence or existence of a European identity (Bruter, 2003). Yet it is very unclear what people tell us when answering our questions on their identities since defining, explaining, and measuring ‘’identity’’ is a challenging topic (Delanty & Rumford, 2005), especially in times of crisis. 
Brexit is a political decision for Britain and Europe for which terms, procedures and consequences are still unclear (Mejias & Banaji, 2017). Recent research on Brexit from different disciplines have been insightful and influential. For example, Brexit has been approached so far from psychology and behavioral science perspectives (Cassidi, Innocenti, & Burkner, 2018) (Bechhofer & McCrone, 2007), cognitive theory and political psychology (Capelos & Nielson, 2018), social policy theories (Ishkanian, 2019), international relations  and politics approaches (Oliver, 2017), political science view (Corbett, 2016) (Delanty G. , 2017), sociological approaches (Outhwaite, 2017) etc. 
The current research aims to further our understanding on the social construction of political identities among young people during times of crisis. Since this study is focusing on Brexit and Europe during COVID-19, online focus groups were selected as a research method to emphasize on the participants interaction in the discussion (Litosseliti, 2003). The benefit of online focus groups is that facilitate group discussions of people who are geographically dispersed or at home (Han et al., 2019). Furthermore, focus groups can be used as simulations of everyday discourses and conversations or as a quasi-naturalistic method for studying the generation of social representations or social knowledge in general (Lunt & Livingstone, 1996). In this qualitative research, 20 online focus groups were conducted with British students in London and Greek students in Athens between May-October 2020 (4-8 participants per discussion). These online discussions were video recorded, transcribed and analysed using discourse analysis.",City University of London,,,,,,,,City University of London,,Panagiota Nakou,,,,,,,,Panagiota Nakou,,European Politics,Political Participation,Constructivism,Identity,Qualitative Comparative Analysis,Brexit,Youth,,Young people’s attitudes towards Brexit and Europe during COVID-19,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64596&EventID=185
0,"The ideological congruence, whether real or perceived, between party members and their elites has been the subject of many studies, yet the evidence for whether party members are more radical remains mixed. In this study, we examine a specific sub-set of party members, those who participate in the youth wings. Because of both their age and status as grassroots members, we might expect them to consider themselves further to the right or left of the party. Specifically, we ask: Do young people in youth wings see themselves as ideologically congruent with their senior parties? Drawing upon original membership surveys of members of twelve youth wings from the main centre-left and centre-right parties in Austria, Australia, Germany, Italy, Spain and Sweden, we identify different categories of young party members based upon how they perceive themselves ideologically in comparison to their senior parties.

0,"The increasing recognition that the world is facing a climate emergency is never far from news headlines and has prompted a surge in environmental activism that has spread globally (Fisher 2019; Wahlström et al. 2019). Responding to these protests, many national governments have been eager to engage with activists to then lay down targets to reduce carbon emissions. Additionally, such protests have also transformed international conversations at important United Nations climate negotiations in the run-up to the 2021 COP26 Climate Conference (Henn, Sloam and Nunes 2021). Although such citizen/elite engagement is evident at national and international levels, we know considerably less about local level interactions between (non-activist) citizens and powerholders concerning the climate emergency. This paper addresses this issue and considers young people’s engagement with, and prioritisation of, environmental issues in their communities. The research was based on a project conducted in the city of Nottingham which is an interesting case study as it has a publicly declared ambition to become the UK’s first carbon neutral city by 2028 (https://www.nottinghamcity.gov.uk/cn2028). Co-production methods were used to design a series of 11 deliberative focus groups with 35 young people aged 15-27, with the groups facilitated by young community-based co-researchers. The findings suggest that young people were typically very concerned about environmental issues yet lacked internal efficacy, feeling relatively uninformed about such matters. They also lacked external efficacy, investing little trust in national governments and global institutions in terms of their motivations, plans and capacities for tackling the climate crisis. Instead, they felt that local-level initiatives and individual actions offered a possible pathway to address climate change; however, there was considerable uncertainty as to the effectiveness of collective responses such as climate strikes and protests.",Nottingham Trent University,"University of London, Royal Holloway College",Nottingham Trent University,,,,,,Nottingham Trent University,,Matt Henn,James Sloam,Christine Huebner,,,,,,Matt Henn,,Environmental Policy,Local Government,Youth,,,,,,"Youth, efficacy and urban environmental engagement: putting youth voice at the centre of Nottingham’s Carbon Neutral 2028 vision",https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65476&EventID=185
0,"Italian citizenship law and its implementation represent a peculiar case study for at least two main reasons. Firstly, law establishes a hierarchy of candidates, defining different bureaucratic paths and legal requirements depending on their status (refugees, permanent residents, spouses of an Italian citizen, born in Italy foreigners, etc.), including a grounding distinction between candidates of Italian descendants (who can also claim for their Italian citizenship to be recognized jure sanguinis) and those of other, and especially non European, origins. Secondly, citizenship law implementation involves a plurality of levels of government and street-level bureaucracies (ministries of the interior and of foreign affairs, consulates, municipalities, prefectures, police headquarters…), as well as an increasing number of private law intermediaries (consultants, lawyers, associations, language schools…). These peculiarities make it a promising case study to explore variations in law implementation, and to grasp how institutional and professional logic intertwine with public or private intermediaries’ own representations of the “nation”, in explaining those variations.  
Sociology of migration and citizenship policies’ implementation at street-level bureaucracies has highlighted civil servants’ discretionary power (Hamidi and Paquet 2019). Field-works have pointed the great extent to which “race”, class and gender perceptions and national stereotypes interfere in their judgments and professional practices, especially when they are charged of some kind of civic integration assessment (Hajjat 2012, Mazouz 2017). Bureaucracy’s dynamic of changing to paperless system, together whit the Covid-19 pandemics restrictions, have drastically reduced interactions with users, as well as the possibility of conducting ethnographic observation in street-level bureaucracies. Instead of assuming that those transformations will lead to a reduction of discretionary and stereotypes, they challenge the way in which discretionary and stereotypes intervene, as well as the possibility for research to disclose it (Bouju 2015, Puglia 2018).
The communication will discuss methodological challenges and early results of my post-doctoral research, originally conceived as an ethnographic comparison of Italian citizenship law implementation at local and street-level bureaucracies (3 Italian municipalities and 2 foreign consulates), but heavily affected by the pandemics and by the process of going to a paperless bureaucracy. Data are largely collected through in-person and on-line interviews held with candidates, civil servants, and private professionals or associative volunteers acting as law intermediaries, rather than ethnographic on-field observation. The communication will discuss the potential and limits of this procedure (Baczko and Dorronsoro 2020, Theviot 2021).",Ecole française de Rome,,,,,,,,Ecole française de Rome,,Daniela Trucco,,,,,,,,Daniela Trucco,,Citizenship,National Identity,Policy Implementation,,,,,,« Making the Italians » with or without them.

0,"Interest groups seek to influence public policy and are often thus perceived as crucial to the functioning of advanced democracies and important contributors to the policy formulation process. Business associations in particular specifically seek to influence policy related to the business environment, with the intention of making it easier for their members, and the wider private sector, to “do business.” Even in democracies, scholars question whether interest groups are influential and, if so, the degree to which their activity influences public policy. However, very little is known of the work and impact of business associations in communist states. Rising to this challenge, this paper explores the efforts of business membership organisations (BMO) in Vietnam to engage in dialogue and advocacy with government. While taking a broad view of the collective work of BMOs, the paper additionally examines the work of two BMOs in particular, the Vietnam Association of Seafood Exporters & Producers and the Traditional Fish Sauce Association. Our case studies find that, whilst shying away from direct confrontation, BMOs can engage successfully with government and can persuade them to do things differently to reduce the burdens imposed on business. Key factors include building trust and mobilising technical expertise of members, careful and systematic research, engaging across the government, collaborating with other business associations and with research institutes, supplying information, and providing evidence and good argumentation. Lacking the challenges of an opposition party, PPD provides an effective channel for government agencies to seek feedback from the business community. Indeed, the dynamics of PPDs effectively create some of the democratic elements observed in multi-party systems of government.

0,"During citizen participation processes around urban development projects, citizens are invited to become engaged in the urban design process. These are usually citizens who live, dwell and sometimes work in the neighborhoods under reconstruction. Citizen participation processes in these cases are based on the premise that citizens who celebrate experiences of everyday life in the neighborhood could inform urban designs in a way that professional planners cannot. There is a positive expectation of role of emotions in this premise: it contains the idea that citizens have emotional connections to local places and people, emotional experiences in these places and with these people, and everyday routines that sustain these bonds. Emotions are thus central to the goal of citizen participation. In practice, however, professional planners handle emotions as obstacles for finalizing plans and making them financially viable. Emotions are standing in ‘the middle’ between being celebrated as well as repressed, circumvented, misunderstood, or even handled with disrespect.

Understanding the role of emotions in citizen participation processes is increasingly important in the Netherlands, where a new Environmental Law (Omgevingswet) requires any spatial development project to engage local stakeholders in decision-making. If policy or planning professionals do not have the tools to include emotions and engage in alternative expressions of citizenship, these processes are deemed to fail. Leaving citizens angry and frustrated in ways that increases the already growing gap between citizens and the state. 

I foresee at least two dimensions in which emotions play a role in the escalation from participation to conflict. First, in the various ways knowledge is understood and recognized. Although many citizens can eloquently explain their routines and preferences in languages that are recognizable and familiar to urban planners, emotional memories seem to be more difficult for urban planners to consider and translate into tangible plans. Second, in the way emotions shape the quality of the interactions between citizens and professionals who are responsible for organizing and managing meetings. When citizens express in ways that are deemed ‘emotional’ the conversation tends to turn contentious. Citizens who express too much anger, for example, are framed as NIMBY’s (Not in My Backyard). Citizens who are dwelling too much on their personal experiences are deemed too romantic to take seriously. In turn, professionals who refrain from showing their own emotions are casted aside as ‘cold’ and ‘bureaucratic’ and loose the trust of citizens. 

In this paper I will use an ethnographic case study analysis to unravel the different roles emotions play in the contentious dynamics of citizen participation processes.",University of Amsterdam,,,,,,,,University of Amsterdam,,Nanke Verloo,,,,,,,,Nanke Verloo,,Citizenship,Conflict,Development,,,,,,‘Emotion in middle’.

0,"On the 15th of June 2021, the Hungarian Parliament passed a controversial new ‘anti-pedophilia’ bill, which, in addition to containing stricter punishment for offenders found guilty of pedophilia, also forbade the ‘propagation’ of homosexuality for underaged children and adolescents. The new law immediately received intense criticism both domestically and internationally. Although the roots of the gender debate trace back to earlier governmental discourses and measures related to ‘gender ideology’ and LGBTQ rights (e.g. banning the gender studies master’s program, terminating the legal gender recognition of transgender people), the debate re-emerged and significantly intensified in relation to the new bill. Our research investigates the related political and media discourses in June and July of 2021, based on the analysis of two pro-governmental (magyarnemzet.hu, pestisracok.hu) and two independent/oppositional (telex.hu, hang.hu) online news portals.
In response to the criticism, the governmental communication and pro-governmental media outlets first argued that the law was not homophobic and did not stigmatize homosexuals, but simply intended to protect children. However, following the intense domestic and international attacks, which may partly be due to the higher international visibility during the UEFA Euro Cup (e.g. rainbow stadium protests), the issue received an additional frame by presenting it as the choice between ‘normality’ and ‘deviance’ as well as the choice between a Europe based on Christian values versus a Europe based on ‘genderism’, pedophilia, ‘mental illnesses’, ‘post-human liberal ideologies’, and other ‘crazy Western trends’. While several high-ranking government officials denied the law’s negative effects and emphasized the freedom of lifestyle for adults, Deputy Prime Minister Zsolt Semjén argued in an interview that homosexuality (from a Christian point of view) was a sin, while another high ranking government official, Bence Rétvári argued that gender became the ‘new state religion’ of Western Europe. Thus, the governmental narrative quickly framed the LGBTQ debate as a question related to the ‘future of Europe’. According to this narrative, the ‘West’ (but the liberal ‘Brussels elite’ in particular) lost its connection with Christian values and jeopardized the future of Europe by following a path that leads to giving up its values and identity that can be stopped only by highlighting the crucial importance of protecting families and children, the real bearers of the European future.  On the other hand, most oppositional actors emphasized individual freedom, liberty, and equality, and framed the debate as a choice between the ‘freedom’ of the ‘West’ and the ‘oppressive systems’ of the ‘East’, emphasizing Hungary’s belongingness to the ‘West’ and arguing that the Orbán Government is leading the country away from it.",Corvinus University of Budapest,Corvinus University of Budapest,Corvinus University of Budapest,,,,,,Corvinus University of Budapest,,Akos Bocskor,Reka Tamassy,Anna Vancso,,,,,,Reka Tamassy,,Europe (Central and Eastern),European Union,Gender,Media,Family,Freedom,Narratives,LGBTQI,‘Gender ideology’ or Christian Europe: Political and media discourses about anti-LGBTQ legislation in the summer of 2021 in Hungary,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65734&EventID=185
0,"Public-private dialogue and lobbying are crucial elements of policymaking in the countries of the Global South and the development of these dialogues has been additionally encouraged by international organizations like the World Bank, the WHO, and the UN. Yet in spite of the importance of interest groups and their activities for democracy and democratisation process, studies of interest groups’ activities are still a rarity when it comes to the Global South. Thus, we call for an examination of the characteristics of interest representation in underexplored countries in comparison to similar processes in their Western counterparts. We argue that it will explicate how neglecting interest representation in much of the world hinders our understanding of advocacy in general. 

This paper is based on the event organized within the framework of ECPR Standing Group on Interest Groups that took place on 5th November 2020 and was titled: ‘Beyond the Usual Suspects: Interest Groups in India, Zimbabwe and Brazil’. The event brought together the work of excellent scholars and further underlined a need for comparison between traditional knowledge and insights from other countries. One of the key findings of the event, which will further be explored in the paper, is that the term ‘interest group’ is rarely used when referring to the advocacy activities in the Global South. This highlights the need to reconsider how we define interest groups and advocacy and, particularly, whether it is possible to do so in a more universally applicable way. We also argue that statistical models deployed most frequently to analyze interest groups’ activities in the Global North are not applicable in most of the countries discussed during the event and in the Global South more broadly, both due to a lack of, or at best intermittent, monitoring of interest groups’ activities and the absence of central registries. This raises questions about how our methodologies of researching interest groups’ activities must be adapted to enable a more encompassing, globally relevant research agenda vis-à-vis interest group advocacy.",Aston University,Technische Universität München – TUM School of Governance,,,,,,,Aston University,,Patrycja Rozbicka,Laura Mahrenbach,,,,,,,Patrycja Rozbicka,,Africa,Asia,Interest Groups,Latin America,Lobbying,Activism,,,‘How much we study?

0,"There seems to be a widespread sense that politics and societies in liberal democracies are becoming more and more hostile and divided. Beyond mere ideological disagreement, political conflict is turning into a question of ‘us’ versus ‘them’, a phenomenon increasingly referred to as ‘affective polarisation’ (e.g., Iyengar et al., 2019; Harteveld, 2021; Reiljan, 2020; Wagner, 2021). While political identities are at the heart of those dynamics of affective polarisation, thus far, surprisingly little attention has been paid to the nature of those identities, how they come into being and how they relate to other, simultaneously existing, identities. 

In this paper, I aim to shed light on those issues by taking a closer look at the role of identities in dynamics of affective polarisation in crisis contexts. The paper consists of three main parts: In the first part, I argue that that dynamics of affective polarisation can arise not only out of conflict between pre-defined social and political identities, such as partisanship or national, ethnic or religious identities, but also out of processes of intense politicisation (e.g. Brexit in the UK or debates about abortion in many Latin American countries) and crises (e.g. the refugee crisis, the climate crisis or the recent Covid-19 pandemic), in which identities are formed through processes of politicisation themselves. While initially based on ideological or strategic disagreements on the right way to handle a certain policy issue or crisis, the construction of political identities based on those disagreements can create a division between different camps, in which members on each side of the division become increasingly hostile and, sometimes even within families or friends groups, refuse to talk to each other. 

In the second part, I present an in-depth study of the mechanisms through which a crisis can transform into dynamics of identity-based affective polarisation using the context of Covid-19 in Germany as a case study. Building on an analysis of public discourse as well as interviews with affectively polarised individuals, I pay particular attention to how identities are constructed by members of the in- as well as the out-group, as well as to the role that certain emotions such as fear, anger, contempt and hope play in this process. 

In the third part, I briefly reflect on the observation that there can be multiple dimensions of identity-based affective polarisation as well as multiple crises structuring a given society either simultaneously or consecutively. In order to understand how people navigate different, possibly conflicting identities and whether there are signs of alignment between different conflict dimensions, I take a first look at the interplay of three politicised – and polarised – issue debates and/or crises that can currently be observed in Germany: Corona, the Climate Crisis and Identity Politics. 

By thus disentangling dynamics of identity construction and affective polarisation in times of crisis, I hope to not only contribute to a better empirical understanding of the phenomenon but to also path the way for a more nuanced normative assessment of its role in democratic theory and politics.",WZB Berlin Social Science Center,,,,,,,,WZB Berlin Social Science Center,,Lena Röllicke,,,,,,,,Lena Röllicke,,Civil Society,Cleavages,Conflict,Democracy,Political Sociology,Identity,,,"‘If you’re not with us, you’re against us’ –  Identities and affective polarisation in times of intense politicisation and crisis",https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65890&EventID=185
0,"Studies of interest groups within all realms of politics and international relations have historically been heavily weighted toward Western democracies, overlooking systems beyond Europe and Western states. Despite being one of the world’s largest countries and democracies, India remains relatively elusive in this field of research. As environmental questions gain ever more traction within domestic and international activities and across all levels of society, gaining a greater understanding of interest representation and lobbying on these questions becomes imperative. Alas, although, interest groups are recognised elsewhere as an important voice on socio-political matters, our knowledge of interest groups system in India, groups’ numbers and activities, is quite limited. Whilst there are a number of articles examining individual environmental cases (e.g., controversial coal projects), their narrative approach to studying advocacy limits the reliability of the results. Specifically, a failure to put interest groups’ activity as the point of focus reduces the potential for broader international comparisons. This paper addresses this problem by consolidating population data on interest groups in India in order to better understand the actors, the dynamics of groups’ activities and the interactions between interest groups and the state. To do so, we define and map environmental interest groups across three neighbouring states within India (Chhattisgarh, Odisha & West Bengal). We subsequently establish a formal statistical framework to analyse the activities and relations of these groups and provide a foundation for future research of environmental advocacy in India.",Kings College London,Aston University,,,,,,,Kings College London,,Ashwin Patel,Patrycja Rozbicka,,,,,,,Ashwin Patel,,Asia,India,Interest Groups,,,,,,"‘Interest groups in the Environmental Regulation in India – population, patterns, and strategies?’",https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63295&EventID=185
0,"Fragmentation in health systems causes discontinuities in the provision of health services, reduces the effectiveness of interventions and increases costs. The fragmentation between ambulatory care sector and hospital sector is a major health policy concern in Germany; the country ranks at the bottom in international comparisons when it comes to the integration of health services.
Integrated health systems must include the data structures that can link patients’ health information over time. The establishment of electronic health records (EHRs) is the basis of a digitalised health system as EHRs record individuals’ most important health-relevant information in a digital documentation system and make this information available to healthcare providers across disciplines, facilities and sectors.
Despite the political efforts undertaken, one might wonder why intersectoral care and healthcare data integration in Germany remain controversial and are still in an embryonic phase. EHR users in Germany amount to less than 1% of the insured persons, and ongoing political debates indicate that a wider implementation will be anything but straightforward.
By exploring the main stakeholders in the existing (fragmented) health system governance in Germany and their interests, this paper examines the topic through the lens of integrated care, offering insights based on decision-making theory. In so doing, it demonstrates that the EHR deployment and use of health data are and will be a matter of governance, rooted in the principles of and the tension between the self-governance of corporatist actors and public administration in Germany.",Maastricht Universiteit,,,,,,,,Maastricht Universiteit,,Tugce Schmitt,,,,,,,,Tugce Schmitt,,Europe (Central and Eastern),Governance,Public Administration,,,,,,‘Joint decision trap’ reloaded?

0,"Contemporary politics has been characterized by increasing accusations of dishonesty, falsehoods, and appeals to opinions instead of factuality and knowledge. Communicating truth and lies not only relates to the spread of misinformation and disinformation but is also strategically employed by different actors to relativize the truth as a shared assessment of reality. Politicians challenge their opponents by accusing them of lying and manipulating the people, while creating their own versions of “truer” reality. This paper analyzes the discourses of truth contestation to assess how truth and lies were discursively constructed and used by different societal and political actors in Austrian and Czech news media. We take the debate on migration as a prime example for an instance of the post-truth discourse as part of the media representation of a politically highly salient and polarizing topic. The two countries make a good case for comparison due to their different affectedness and handling of the refugee crisis as well as different public reactions to the crisis. In particular, Austria has been on the direct refugee route with 88,160 asylum seekers in 2015, while only 1,515 refugees came to the Czech Republic. The initial political and public reactions to the crisis differed as well: Austria saw a rather welcoming, pro-refugee approach, while the Czech Republic experienced antagonistic and sometimes even xenophobic responses by parts of political representatives and the public. In the paper, we analyze the print versions of the three most popular national newspapers with different political leanings (conservative vs. liberal) and journalistic routines (tabloid vs. broadsheet) and the two most popular disinformation online media platforms per country, for which we expect wealthy material for analysis. Based on a selection of seed words covering the truth-lie polarity, we then use automated content analysis, more specifically latent semantic scaling, to scale media coverage on migration regarding the prominence and dynamics of truth contestation. Building on a post-truth political communication approach, we cover the period of 2013-2020 and take a comparative perspective looking for country and newspaper differences, with a special focus on the political actors driving such discourse relying on named entity recognition techniques. Overall, our study contributes to the debate by offering insights into the dynamics of truth contestation as a pressing challenge to the functioning of democracy.",University of Vienna,Masaryk University,,,,,,,Masaryk University,,Olga Eisele,Alena Kluknavska,,,,,,,Alena Kluknavska,,Media,Migration,Populism,Quantitative,Communication,,,,"‘Liar, Liar, Pants on Fire!’ An Automated Analysis of the Dynamics of Truth Contestation in Austrian and Czech News Media",https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63984&EventID=185
0,"In response to proposals to test geoengineering technology over their land, the Saami council called on Harvard University to shut down the project involved (the Stratospheric Controlled Perturbation Experiment or ScoPEx), writing that: “as representatives of Indigenous Peoples, we do not approve legitimizing development towards solar geoengineering technology, nor for it to be conducted in or above our lands, territories and skies, nor in any ecosystems anywhere.” This paper examines the conflicting scientific and indigenous epistemologies and associated conceptions of governance and sovereignty that are illustrated in such conflicts. It briefly elaborates the history of the ScoPEx proposal and sets it in the context of the role of scientific knowledge in climate and geoengineering debate. It then draws on indigenous expertise and scholarship, particularly that of Tyson Yunkaporta and Kyle Whyte, to work through a series of questions about how such knowledge generation activities might be appropriately evaluated, interrogated and decided upon with due respect for indigenous sovereignty, understood not only as territorial sovereignty but also as epistemic sovereignty. In doing so it contrasts these with the processes used to govern research, development and deployment of potentially risky technologies in sovereign nation states and multilateral institutions, noting parallels with challenges to such securitised governance raised by plurinationalism, deliberative participation processes and feminist ethics of care, amongst others. In conclusion it suggests that in engaging with technologies designed to directly manipulate environments and earth systems at a planetary scale, humanity will face a far-reaching clash of sovereignties.

0,"A well-established line of research on systems of separation of powers argues that lawmakers anticipate courts’ constitutional review of their acts and strategically avoid drafting policies that are at risk of a judicial veto. Lawmakers’ so-called ‘autolimitation’ has attractive properties: Unconstitutional policies are kept off the books without the need for judicial interventions and otherwise overburdened courts need to resolve fewer cases. Contrasting these claims, I argue in this paper that lawmakers who ignore constitutional concerns adopt better policies. I develop a formal model that shows that all too risk-averse lawmakers disproportionately shy away from policies that would survive judicial scrutiny, and hence fail to translate their constituents’ demands into policy. Given that lawmakers possess only imperfect information about how courts would decide their cases in the future, I show that the benefits of lawmakers’ strict auto-limitation are outweighed by its costs. The formal model provides an explanation of why we often observe lawmakers casting constitutional concerns about their policy choices aside, and I make the case that lawmakers’ choice to take constitutional risks is in the interest of both their constituents and courts themselves.",Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München – LMU,,,,,,,,Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München – LMU,,Philipp Schroeder,,,,,,,,Philipp Schroeder,,Parliaments,Courts,Decision Making,Policy-Making,,,,,‘Never tell me the odds’: Why lawmakers should take constitutional risks,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63555&EventID=185
0,"This research investigates the discursive structure, symbolism, and iconography of the anti-Covid-19 protests from Romania. In 2020 – 2021, AUR, alongside other far-right movements like the New Right and Romanian Heart Union, participated in more than 30 anti-COVID-19 measures and vaccines protests. Using a wide array of national symbols and Orthodox iconography, AUR employed ritualistic ceremonies and espoused counter-hegemonic discourses that positioned the authorities' mandates in a sacred conflict against the nationalist idea of Romanianness. 
Methodologically, this study combines virtual ethnography and semiotic analysis for more than 30 protests collected from social media, YouTube, and media. The results of the virtual ethnography and semiotic analysis reveal that the symbols and iconography employed by AUR during protest expressed new rituals of rebellion against the authorities’ decisions to restrict the movement of the people. Likewise, the on-the-ground discourse of AUR conveyed new counter-hegemonic attitudes towards the neo-liberal ideal of the EU. Moreover, the analysis reveals that the mechanics used during demonstrations against the Government reveal striking thematic similarities with the January 6 Insurrection from the United States.",University of Helsinki,,,,,,,,University of Helsinki,,Ionut Chiruta,,,,,,,,Ionut Chiruta,,Europe (Central and Eastern),Extremism,Nationalism,Mobilisation,Protests,,,,‘NIHIL SINE DEO IN FAR-RIGHT PROTESTS' - RITUALS OF REBELLIONS AND COUNTER-HEGEMONIC NARRATIVES DURING ANTI-CORONAVIRUS PROTESTS,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63459&EventID=185
0,"The pandemic has highlighted the vulnerabilities of global supply chains and the instability of our food systems. Demand for more resilient and sustainable forms of food provision has rapidly increased, fuelling people's engagement in the alternative practice of community-supported agriculture (CSA). In CSA local farmers and households share the costs and products of farming, allowing them to organise their food provision around short supply chains and in relative independence of markets. While this may offer a prefigurative vision for a non-commercial and sustainable food system, CSA is considered limited regarding its scalability and social accessibility. 
However, these concerns only apply to individual CSAs, whereas we know little about the capacity of multi-CSA networks to expand and institutionalise the practice, and thereby possibly overcome its shortcomings. This paper aims to alleviate this blind spot. It investigates the dynamics of local and regional CSA collaboration in Wales and Saxony, drawing on qualitative case studies based on documentary analysis, interviews, and observation. Through a lens of politico-economic social movement theory, the paper characterises the contextual conditions, structures, aims and practices of CSA networks, explains their achievements and challenges, and discusses their capacities for expanding and institutionalising CSA. 
The paper finds multi-CSA networks to offer major benefits by sharing expertise and resources and engaging in community activities and policy advocacy. However, it also reveals challenges for CSA’s scalability and autonomy due to the networks’ reliance on third-party supporters and funding, as well as competitive tensions between network members. It concludes by discussing possible responses to these challenges by CSAs and policymakers.",Cardiff University,,,,,,,,Cardiff University,,Bernd Bonfert,,,,,,,,Bernd Bonfert,,Political Economy,Social Movements,Qualitative,,,,,,‘None of this would have worked if it was just one of us.’ Collaboration across regional community-supported agriculture networks.,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64586&EventID=185
0,"Cross-border corruption is a collective action problem requiring a coordinated multilateral response. Since the 1970s, the normative basis for what constitutes corruption and how it should be addressed has continued to evolve, with normative alignment among western democracies resulting in coordinated multilateral action on issues such as international bribery. Western democracies now have a range of instruments at their disposal to address cross-border corruption, from anti-bribery legislation targeting the supply side of cross-border cases to selective policy instruments such as sanctions to target corrupt individuals and their ill-gotten gains. 

The development of this current global anticorruption regime reflects how states must contend with multiple, at times conflicting or incompatible, demands in establishing and using anticorruption instruments. Initially, concerns over economic disadvantages resulted in the ‘strategic under-enforcement’ of anti-bribery legislation by the United States until other developed economies were bound by similar rules. In contrast, over the last decade, states’ foreign policy agendas have increasingly become entangled with the selective use of instruments such as sanctions, resulting in strategic enforcement. 

This paper compares U.S. and E.U. cross-national enforcement patterns for two instruments within the global anticorruption regime that have different purposes: anti-bribery legislation and corruption-related sanctions. Examining whether enforcement trends for both instruments reflect competitive (economic or political) interests or not, the paper explores whether unilateral or multilateral enforcement is more closely correlated with norm-based or interest-based enforcement motivations. Furthermore, the paper identifies that even interest-based unilateral action on corruption can jumpstart a ‘norm-cascade’.",Hertie School,,,,,,,,Hertie School,,Katherine Wilkins,,,,,,,,Katherine Wilkins,,Foreign Policy,Constructivism,Quantitative,Corruption,Normative Theory,Empirical,,,‘Strategic under-enforcement’ to ‘strategic enforcement’: what do trends in patterns of anticorruption enforcement reveal about collective action on cross-border corruption?,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65564&EventID=185

The effect of media coverage on citizens’ satisfaction with the functioning of their democracy has long been at the centre of discussions concerning the role of media in shaping public opinion. However, few studies have been able to link variation in coverage to the evolution of citizen attitudes at the individual level. To address this research question, we scrape 1.5 million tweets from UK newspapers and apply a topic modelling algorithm to identify the topics and sentiment prevalent in the different news outlets. We then match our results to individual-level daily tracking data on satisfaction with democracy in the UK that we collected in partnership with YouGov from November 2019 to December 2021, matching respondent newspaper readership on each day, to the daily salience and sentiment of news coverage from that source.

0,"To explain recent extremist attacks committed by men who identify as involuntary celibates, various scholars refer to theories of aggrieved entitlement and relative deprivation. Seen from this perspective, violence avenges the Incels’ perceived victimhood, caused by women who allegedly deny them their supposed right to sex. Although victimhood evidently fuels the Incel community and its militant discourse and dynamics online, as a motive it does not clarify why most aggrieved Incels still resign in their loveless fate. 

Hence, this paper hypothesises that the difference between accepting the Incel destiny or choosing violence rests on individual nuances that are brushed over by analyses of the Incel community as a whole. We should examine instead the array of motivations at the micro-level to understand why some Incels crossed the threshold of violence when others did not. Analysing Rodger’s desire to shed his marginalised masculinity and become an alpha male, I identify the pivotal moment Rodger saw himself confronted with his inability to be and act like a ‘real man.’ Subsequently, I argue that Rodger’s recognition of his own involvement and responsibility in causing and solving his predicament as a marginalised male, and not perceived victimhood, drove Rodger to weaponise himself and realise his masculine potential. 

By incorporating the role of masculinity in Rodger’s move towards violence, the paper aims to connect insights from male supremacy studies to those from radicalisation and terrorism studies, two fields that arguably talk past each other when explaining Incel terrorism. As such, the paper provides a nuanced and richer understanding of personal motivations driving violent Incel behaviour.",University of Utrecht,,,,,,,,University of Utrecht,,Annelotte Janse,,,,,,,,Annelotte Janse,,Political Violence,Terrorism,Identity,Men,Narratives,,,,"‘Who's the alpha male now, bitches?’ Elliot Rodger and radical redemption",https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65432&EventID=185
0,"Starting from two comparative research projects on the implementation of nationality and citizenship policies, we explore the challenges and advantages of doing comparative research on the implementation of nationality and migration laws. We have conducted in particular ethnographic research on the implementation of various citizenship policies (naturalisation, citizenship revocation) in the UK and France (Fargues) and UK and Belgium (Sredanovic). Comparative work in this field is subject to traditional challenges that any comparative research design involves (e.g. issues of comparability across cases, choice of large-N vs. small-N research designs, choice of methodologies, etc.). It is also subject to more specific challenges, including the variation in centralised and decentralised procedures, in the number and kind (public/private, specialised/non specialised) institutions involved, and in the level of discretion and judicial review available. Further, the availability of data depends on the degree of motivation required in the decision (and in the presence of informal rejection of applications), the percentage of rejected application that are appealed in court, and the degree to which institutions compile and make publicly accessible statistical data about the outcomes. Depending on such factors, the data available on the implementation of policies can be more or less opaque (e.g. in relation to the motivations of the decisions) and more or less accurate (e.g. in terms of ratio of acceptance/refusals). At the same time, comparative work allows to avoid pitfalls such as overgeneralisation of the results and overspecificity of the explanatory models, and allows to trace the diffusion and local adaptations of specific policies across different countries and across the sub-national institutions involved in implementation. Building on our own experiences as researchers on the implementation of nationality and migration laws and engaging with other studies on the same topic, the main ambitions of this paper will be (1) to discuss various obstacles that researchers in this area are likely to face and imagine ways in which they might be able to circumvent those difficulties; (2) delineate key contributions that comparative research on implementation practices is likely to make, provided that the difficulties identified can be successfully addressed.",Sciences Po Paris,Université Libre de Bruxelles,,,,,,,Sciences Po Paris,Université Libre de Bruxelles,Emilien Fargues,Djordje Sredanovic,,,,,,,Emilien Fargues,Djordje Sredanovic,Citizenship,Methods,Comparative Perspective,Policy Implementation,,,,,“Comparing implementation practices across national and sub-national contexts: advantages and challenges”,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=65221&EventID=185
0,"In the course of the last ten years several Southern European societies have undergone episodes of socio-economic crisis. While the causes, duration and intensity of the crisis are not unitary but variable, all affected countries and societies have had to cope with it and overcome it too. In this sense the crisis may be seen as a common denominator that distinguishes such countries/societies, alongside a set of other common features, from the rest of Europe. In particular, in the course of undergoing the crisis the affected societies have been additionally burdened by the wearing down of an indispensable quality for social life, namely of trust that is an essential value in itself and vital for social interaction. In support of this claim various measurements are available, which indicate that generalized as well as more specific political sensitive forms of trust has been faltering significantly during the crisis years.
	My central aim then in this paper is to examine the relationship between socio-economic crisis and trust, with an emphasis in trust in government and political institutions. Specifically, to establish whether there is in fact a link between these variables, and if so to ponder on the challenge to overhaul the damage. In fact, this would be an imperative if recovery is to take place while the democratic features of Southern European countries are preserved.

0,"On March 15th 2020 the border between Poland and Germany was closed. Concrete blocks were placed on small roads across the ‘green border’, soldiers stationed at every border crossing with loaded guns, and for the first time since 1989 it wasn’t only hard to cross the border, it was impossible. This was in stark contrast to the 13 years of close to complete openness of the border, with Poland and Germany both in the Schengen space. A borderscape in which the physical manifestation of the border had all but disappeared was suddenly divided again by a hard border. The lives of those individuals who’s daily routine had been transnational, whose lives were centered in the border, had from one day to the other transformed and cast back to the periphery. In my PhD study I explore the impact of the pandemic related border closures on the identity of borderscape inhabitants at the Polish-German border. 

Through a qualitative approach, I explore in what ways these experiences have shaped and changed the internalized network of identity anchors among a diverse range of borderscape inhabitants. 
- Have local, regional, national or European identifications changed? Or were these just a few hard months with no sustainable impact? 
- Have political or personal prioritizations shifted? 

The border closures were a tragedy for many persons whose lives were significantly disrupted through them. Scientifically, however, they provide a quasi-experimental setting, that opens up avenues towards understanding how external disruptions can and do have an influence on identity.

0,"The attractiveness of higher education in Northern Cyprus has caught the interest of experienced observers of disputed territories and other so-called de facto states, surprised to see an unrecognized state become a destination for tens of thousands of international students (de Waal and von Löwis, 2020). While young Turks made up the vast majority of students until the late 2000s, there has been a significant diversification of the population in the past ten years, with a notable influx of students from sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East and the post-Soviet space. The economic value of higher education for the local economy is widely recognized, even if its commercial dimension is hotly debated (Arnhold and World Bank, 2016). One question remains to be addressed: to what extent this attractiveness is politicized by the authorities of the “Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus” and to what extent is it associated with the cause of formal recognition ?  Research leads us to highlight that international promotion and nation branding are indeed being politicized within the context of the non-recognition of North Cyprus, but the formal authorities are not the main actors of this politicization.

In this paper, we propose to analyze university attractiveness as a resource that can be captured in positioning and power relations. We will note, contrary to the initial hypothesis, the absence of formal strategies for reinvesting this attractiveness as soft power by local authorities. We will then present the informal tactics that aim to present and publicize the attractiveness of higher education as proof of the resilience and seriousness of the state project, by looking at the actors who carry them out, their positions in the local and international academic and political space, their resources and their representations.  
The internationalization of higher education is not invested as a tool in the quest for formal recognition by local authorities. Similarly, contrary to what the literature on soft power might lead us to believe, the authorities in charge of foreign policy rely on this attractiveness as a potential tool for influence and promotion at the international level only to a very limited extent. Some local actors produce and mediatize attractivity as a proof of the strength and legitimacy of the claim of statehood in North Cyprus, but they are doing it from their position in the academic space and stay on the margins of the political space. Their efforts to politicize this attractiveness express both an individual commitment to the ""pro-separation cause"" and ambitions to reaffirm the legitimacy of the autonomy enjoyed by private higher education locally: their efforts to emphasize the contribution of the universities to the ""national cause"" can be interpreted as part of a legitimization of the autonomy of the higher education sector vis-à-vis the political space.

0,"This paper presents the findings of an on-going study on how young vocational school students in Finland frame themselves in society and whether they are seen in various media, and what effects this may have in relations to societal power relations, fake news and information operations globally. The explorative research with n=213 vocational school students as co-researchers, tell us that young vocational school students use framing to create understandings of themselves, of truths and trusted sources in society and in media. Co-researchers view themselves as missing in traditional media but find freedom, news and information freely on social media. Content from various media is viewed as reliable and trustworthy but also as problematic propaganda based on personal value framing. Thus, in this paper, the aim was to present the breadth of their thinking and to draw conclusions from the empirical data produced solely by the co-researchers. Do news media paint a picture of uninterested young vocational school students, and for what purpose? To sustain power relations? At first sight, yes. The broader questions are: why and at what cost? The empirical results show that co-researchers do live in their own worlds compared, in their view, to those portrayed in the (Finnish) media. Thus, Lippman’s (1922) notion rings true. The co-researchers say that they are othered in various media and society because they do not view vocational school students as important or worthy. Co-researchers think that traditional gatekeeper media are not gatekeepers anymore, and shy away from the difficult language and hard-to-understand content. While news and information are consumed mostly from social media, but traditional media has not been abandoned altogether. Yet co-researcher say that the traditional print and news frames them as lazy, less credible and legitimate actors in society. Social media and its many platforms felt more “owned” by the co-researchers. The most popular platforms to use and to find information and news from were Instagram, with TikTok and Snapchat coming after. Social media was seen as natural part of life, as a news and information outlet, but also as a dangerous place where nothing is real, and nothing should be trusted due to fake news, information operations by various actors, deepfakes, opinions framed as factual information, and various negative effects. While they look for that entertaining content across the media spectrum, bullying from adults, journalists and other youths is an ever-present concern. Also, co-researchers noted that both traditional print media and social media can be used as propaganda either by the state or by the editorial staff and “owning class”. Although power relations in information and content creation have changed rapidly, what possibilities and threats may arise and to whom? It will not be enough to address this in relation to journalists and content producers but those influential actors who may be hidden from the so-called mainstream debates. Indeed, in the future of democracies the questions of trusted sources, fake news, deepfakes, information operations and influencing through information are fundamental.",Tampere University,,,,,,,,Tampere University,,Niina Meriläinen,,,,,,,,Niina Meriläinen,,Media,Agenda-Setting,Communication,Political Engagement,Power,Empirical,Theoretical,Youth,“I find this really entertaining” – First look of the relationship between vocational school students and various media,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=62557&EventID=185
0,"Different modes of attachment and alienation, of belonging and not belonging can be
extracted from a variety of texts as Linda Shortt shows in her monograph German
Narratives of Belonging (2015). Ego documents such as memoirs and diaries, in
particular, reveal individual aspects of identity negotiation in new, unknown
circumstances and environments. Here, this paper builds on genre and narrative
theories concerning exile and the Kindertransport, which was recently discussed by
Stephanie Homer in her monograph The Kindertransport in Literature: Reimagining
Experience (2022).

By moving away from the concept of Heimat, as Shortt also suggests, towards
a more inclusive and, at the same time, multifaceted understanding of belonging, this
paper acknowledges the various ways of attachment to places, people, and cultures.
By anchoring the concepts of belonging in an analysis of selected diary entries and
memoir excerpts of children who arrived in the UK on a Kindertransport 1938/39, this
paper proposes that these documents are a site of construction of national as well as
transnational belonging and identities in flux. Furthermore, by contextualising the
personal perspective of the ego-documents within a wider historical and political
discourse surrounding the Kindertransport, this paper contributes to underexplored
aspects of identities of child migrants.

Through close reading of selected examples and textual, this paper will show
that the Kindertransportees continued to negotiate their belonging throughout their
lives. Here, I’m taking on a comparative approach of looking at diaries and memoirs,
two inherently forms of life writing that illuminate aspects of identity development
through different temporal dimensions. Hereby, I emphasise the children’s agency in
shaping their exile experience and negotiating their identities. In the analysis of the
diaries, I will mainly draw on theories of everyday life and memory studies to highlight
how we can extract ongoing processes of identity negotiation and changing notions of
belonging from the entries even if these themes are not overtly discussed. In contrast, 
memoirs often deal with issues of identity formation more explicitly. These
characteristics then facilitate a comparative approach to investigate the construction
of belonging and identity.

Considering recent development in British migration politics, investigating
notions of belonging and identity of Kindertransportees become ever more important
as the scheme is often represented as a success story of integration and cultural
assimilation of the child refugees. The ways in which this movement not only impacted
the children but also society as a whole and how it has been utilised as a story of great
British humanitarian hospitality stand in contrast to one another. This paper illuminates
that the Kindertransport experience and its lasting impact situate themselves, similar
to the identities of the children, in an in-between of success and failure, of assimilation
and alienation.","University of London, School of Advanced Study, Institute of Modern Languages Research",,,,,,,,"University of London, School of Advanced Study, Institute of Modern Languages Research",,Monja Stahlberger,,,,,,,,Monja Stahlberger,,Migration,Identity,War,Memory,Refugee,,,,“Ich wollte so sehr englisch sein”: Construction of National and Transnational Belonging in Diaries & Memoirs of Refugee Children from National Socialist Germany,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64142&EventID=185
0,"With the increased mainstreaming of the far right, in some countries, additional political space has been created for new, more extreme far-right contenders, who continuously test the boundaries of what can be said and done, particularly in relation to third-country (Muslim) immigration. To explore how such new challengers are received by the existing domestic far-right extra- and parliamentary actors, this paper focuses on the case of Denmark and the entry of Rasmus Paludan to both the protest and electoral arena. In recent years, the Danish far right has profited from a societal far-right mainstreaming, together with low suppression levels of people’s freedom of speech. Speaking into the dominant Danish discourse around ‘freedom of speech’, Rasmus Paludan has become renowned for his provocative anti-Islam protest actions (including Koran-burnings and derogatory slurs), and for setting up the party Hard Line (Stram Kurs)). His entry to the political scene has led to renewed strong discussions about the (potential limits to) freedom of speech in Denmark, both at the public, political, and media level. Drawing on the concept of ‘strategic action fields’ and Meguid’s work on political competition, and focusing on 6 of the most prominent Danish far-right extra- and parliamentary organisations, this study analyses how the Danish far right has responded to the actions of Rasmus Paludan. Through a frame analysis of their website articles and blog posts, the analysis shows rather diverse responses from the organisations, ranging from strong support (‘Counter-Jihad’ organisations) to outright dismissal (from the extreme right Nordfront).",Aalborg Universitet,,,,,,,,Aalborg Universitet,,Anita Nissen,,,,,,,,Anita Nissen,,Political Competition,Internet,Qualitative,Narratives,Political Activism,,,,“It is not us who throw rocks and burn cars”: The Danish Far Right’s Positions on Rasmus Paludan,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63685&EventID=185
0,"As the use of deliberative mini-publics becomes more widespread (OECD 2020), they face a number of threats to their integrity. The expansion of these practices has led to the professionalisation and commercialisation of participation (Bherer et al 2017a), which raises potential tensions between commercial and democratic interests (Hendriks and Carson 2008). Practitioners – the individuals and organisations who design, facilitate and deliver deliberative mini-publics, play a central role in the realisation of democratic ideals on the ground (Hendriks, Ercan and Boswell 2020), yet relatively little attention has been paid to them (Escobar 2022). This paper focuses on the experiences of practitioners as they navigate tensions between the commissioning body’s interests and demands, and the integrity of the deliberative process. Drawing on interview data with 22 practitioners, this paper provides a qualitative thematic analysis exploring how practitioners experience and respond to these tensions, and the limitations they face.

0,"The academic literature on the explanations of the rise of far-right parties in Europe has been characterized by a debate between scholars who highlight cultural anxieties and those who emphasize economic grievances. However, there is also a debate on the economic side between the idea that the support for the far-right is a result of the degrading situation of the poorer classes, and the idea that the upper-middle classes are also affected by precarity and are losing out relative to the elites in society. This research contributes to the academic literature on the far-right by investigating the empirical relationship between (a) income inequality and the percentage of vote shares for (b) far-right parties across a forty-year timeframe.

Adopting an aggregate level approach, the paper examines different income groups across 33 European countries in the period between 1980-2020 via an original large N database that features multiple imputation methods. The panel data fixed-effects statistical models indicate that only the income share (i.e., distribution) of the bottom 40% is statistically significant and correlated to higher levels of support for the far-right. Therefore, the empirical findings in the paper indicate that the worsening economic condition of the working classes is related to the increasing vote share of the far-right.",Hong Kong Metropolitan University,Chinese University of Hong Kong,,,,,,,Chinese University of Hong Kong,,James F.

0,"Criminal and institutional violence related to the “War on Drugs” has caused since 2006 more than 95 thousand disappearances of women and men in Mexico, with serious consequences in terms of human rights violations and humanitarian crisis. In response to this tragedy and faced with impunity, corruption and negligence of the state authorities, a national human rights movement has arisen, composed mainly by relatives of desaparecidos. Grouped in collectives and associations, the relatives of victims started a cycle of mobilizations against enforced disappearances that lasts until today, during the pandemic era. Their primary goal is the immediate and effective search for the disappeared ones through advocacy and lobbying; the civic monitoring over public investigations; the creation of networks and alliances at local, national, and international level with other social and institutional actors; non-violent public protest demonstrations such as marches, sit-in in front of institutional buildings, occupation of the prosecutor’s offices and press conferences. The objective of this contribution is to highlight the main characteristics and differences regarding the contentious issues, strategies and methods of protest used by the movement before and during the context characterized by the spreading of Covid-19. I argue that the measures of containment of the epidemiological emergency and the restrictions of the mobility forced the movement to change some strategies and forms of protest, for example by making massive use of social media and “digital demonstrations”, but, at the same time, they have not stopped the thirst for justice and truth. I show that the political and social effects of these measures and the development of the virus implied a worsening of the status of the relatives of desaparecidos, whose psychological, emotional, and economic conditions were already widely compromised by the forced disappearance of their loved one. Based on interviews to the relatives of victims, public reports, news, and movements’ press releases, this paper aims also to analyse the relationship between the movement and the Mexican state during the developing of the human rights cycle of protest.",Università degli Studi di Milano,,,,,,,,Università degli Studi di Milano,,Thomas Aureliani,,,,,,,,Thomas Aureliani,,Civil Society,Contentious Politics,Human Rights,Latin America,Social Movements,Corruption,Mobilisation,,“The emergency in the emergency”: The human rights mobilizations against enforced disappearance in Mexico before and during the pandemic era.,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63461&EventID=185
0,"Until the late 1960s, blue-collar Americans voted to the left of the political spectrum almost by default. While Democrats stood for the interests of labor, the Republican Party was considered the political arm of plutocrats and business elites. But in the present-day political landscape, the GOP has paradoxically established itself as both, the party of capital and that of the working class. Numerous observers have interrogated why large portions of wage-earning Americans have been consistently voting against their own best interests by supporting conservative agendas like cuts to social security, tax breaks for the rich, and anti-union legislation. As a culmination of this contradictory phenomenon, real estate tycoon Donald Trump has emerged as an identification figure for working-class America, especially appealing to the demographic of non-college-educated white men who overwhelmingly voted Republican in both the 2016 and the 2020 presidential elections. And while Trump has been known to don a hard hat and imitate shoveling motions at MAGA rallies to the cheers of his working-class supporters, politicians with actual working-class roots and distinct pro-labor agendas – Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez come to mind – are viewed with hostility by many lower-class Americans. This paper explores this ideological divide with a specific focus on gendered political symbolism. It argues that, counter to a common narrative, Trump’s emergence as a “blue-collar billionaire” is not a sudden swerve of history but the continuation of a decades-long conservative strategy. In fact, casting liberal advocacy for increased government support and gender and racial equality as an assault on traditional American masculinity has been a conservative staple since the times of Richard Nixon. “[T]hese are our people now,” Nixon’s adviser Pat Buchanan famously said about working-class voters in the wake of the conservative presidential campaign of 1968, which successfully channeled cultural anxieties over changing social norms into a narrative of American manhood under threat. Ironically, among the Democrat leaders who were habitually derided as “wimps” were decorated war veterans like George McGovern and John Kerry. Meanwhile, the Republican candidates offered up as representatives of rugged American manhood often came from elite backgrounds, like George W. Bush, or were mere performers of male mythology, like Ronald Reagan. In today’s GOP, gendered symbolism remains a key instrument for political mobilization and polarization. When Trump mocks Biden’s social distancing as cowardly “hiding in the basement,” show-wrestles faux opponents to the ground, or assures the world that he does not have a small penis, he enacts the signifiers of unapologetically confrontational masculinity designed to appeal to working-class men who feel adrift in the tide of rapidly changing gender norms and economic realities. By specifically investigating the messaging in Republican presidential campaigns from the late 1960s to the present, this paper outlines how the GOP reinvented itself as a blue-collar party by appealing to working-class sensibilities and emotional identities, even as it routinely undercut workers’ concrete material interests.",Universität Hamburg,,,,,,,,Universität Hamburg,,Olga Thierbach-McLean,,,,,,,,Olga Thierbach-McLean,,Gender,Political Parties,USA,Qualitative,Men,,,,“These Are Our People Now”: Performative Masculinity and the Emergence of the GOP as a Working-Class Party.,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=66113&EventID=185
0,"What motivates diasporas to engage politically in origin countries and how do emigrants construct their sense of inclusion/exclusion in home politics? The literature documents considerable variation in mobilization within and across emigrant communities, as well as the difficulties of accounting for both individual and aggregate variables while capturing the meaning of ‘politics’ in emigrants’ views. This study explores mobilization dynamics of Uruguayans abroad who, unlike other South American diasporas, have mobilized transnationally to advance a number of claims at home. It shows that activism varies considerably across destination sites and takes diverse forms. Its effectiveness has been partial, though, especially concerning the controversial issue of emigrant enfranchisement. Building upon qualitative methods, the analysis offers novel evidence on a relatively under-researched diaspora, while contributing to broader debates on why engagement from abroad may remain ambivalent and fragmented, albeit intense and highly politicized.",University of Southampton,,,,,,,,University of Southampton,,Ana Margheritis,,,,,,,,Ana Margheritis,,Citizenship,Migration,Political Participation,Qualitative,,,,,“Uruguay somos todos” (We are All Uruguay): Political Engagement with Home Politics among Uruguayans abroad,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64066&EventID=185
0,"Studies on the diffusion of protests and social movements stress the necessity of geographical, historical, organizational or cultural proximities between countries as the factors that facilitate the spread of ideas, frames, identities and repertoires of collective action from one country to another. Yet in the last two decades, the explosion of various protests across the globe and their mobilizing impact on each other challenged this established view. The connection between the 2019 protests in Hong Kong and Barcelona was a remarkable example of this recent phenomenon: despite the absence of the abovementioned proximity factors, the protests in Hong Kong were referred to as an inspirational benchmark by a considerable number of Catalan protesters, as various tactics, repertoires and frames were adopted from Hong Kong during the protests in Catalonia. Designed as a case study that investigates this least-likely case of cross-national diffusion of protests and social movements, this study explores why and how protests inspire other protests in distant and diverse places. To address these questions, I employed Grounded Theory methodology by analyzing 1) twenty-five semi-structured in-depth interviews with activists who participated in the 2019 Protests in Catalonia, 2) textual data from online and offline documents published by the Catalan activist network Tsunami Democratic, and 3) the secondary sources that involve interviews with or releases from the organizers/spokespersons of Tsunami Democratic. The preliminary findings demonstrate that the national and transnational dimensions of contention were highly interconnected in this case, as the adoption of behavioral and ideational components of collective action from Hong Kong was accompanied by the dramatic changes in the political opportunities and emotional context in Catalonia since the 2017 Catalan independence referendum. The findings also indicate that perceived contextual similarities and moral shocks triggered by shared collective traumas may still enable protesters to identify themselves with other protesters in distant countries even in the absence of proximity factors and comprehensive knowledge about those distant groups. Consequently, this study aims at contributing to the recent debates on refining the theory of diffusion by exploring the role of cognitive and emotional processes in the spread of protests, which have been largely neglected in social movement studies, from an agential and cultural approach. Besides, the findings also shed light on the changing dynamics of the pro-independentist Catalan movement, as well as the debates about the radicalization of collective action.",Scuola Normale Superiore,,,,,,,,Scuola Normale Superiore,,Batuhan Eren,,,,,,,,Batuhan Eren,,Social Movements,Identity,Qualitative,Activism,,,,,“We’re going to do a Hong Kong!”:  Diffusional Interactions between the 2019 Protests in Hong Kong and Catalonia,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63589&EventID=185
0,"Populist parties are considered to make use of more emotions in their political communication than nonpopulist parties. Likewise, emotions have been suggested to at least partly drive the vote for populist parties, amongst a set of key cognitive and attitudinal factors (Rico, Guinjoan, and Anduiza 2017; Salmela and von Scheve 2017). Prior research has indeed verified that populist parties are significantly more likely to make use of negative emotional appeals and less positive emotional appeals than mainstream parties (Nai 2021; Widmann 2021). In this study, the goal is to further explore the role of issue ownership in relationship to emotional appeals. Issue ownership theory (Petrocik 1996) suggests that political parties ‘own’ specific policy issues, making it crucial for these parties to mobilize on these issues and boost the salience of these issues. Exposure of issues in both traditional and social media facilitates attempts to claim issue ownership and affect voter perceptions of issue ownership (Stubager and Seeberg 2016; Walgrave, Lefevere, and Nuytemans 2009). 

Combining theory on the role of emotions in political communication, populism and issue ownership, we assess patterns in the dynamics of political social media posts from both the supply (parties) and demand-side (voters) perspective. Regarding the supply-side, all parties are expected to mostly promote their owned issues in their social media posts. Populist parties are more likely to make emotional appeals than mainstream parties, in particular negative ones. Still, issue ownership is anticipated to matter, with emotional appeals being most prevalent while discussing issues that political parties own. Regarding the demand-side, we expect citizens to respond more emotionally and strongly to issues of populist parties in general, and to owned issues of a specific party compared to issues that a party does not own. 

We test these hypotheses in Belgium via relying on an extensive dataset covering 9 months of Facebook and Twitter posts (including measurements of engagements with these posts) for populist and nonpopulist parties and party presidents (n = 12,438 ) in 2021. We combine computational and manual content analysis to assess the sentiment (via a dictionary-based method) of the posts and identify political issues, while collecting engagements with the posts (likes, shares or retweets, comments, specific reactions on Facebook). Preliminary findings suggest that posts by left- and right-wing populist actors significantly contain more emotional appeals —negative ones in particular— than posts by mainstream party actors. However, we find this to be mostly driven by the issues that are being highlighted. Especially posts on owned issues by populist parties (e.g., immigration, but also economic issues) contain many, mostly negative, emotional appeals. Moreover, citizens are more likely to react emotional (i.e., angry) to populist parties’ communication than to nonpopulist party posts, which holds for left- and right-wing populist parties. Again, issue ownership plays a role, as citizens do also tend to respond more emotionally to posts on owned issues of mainstream parties.",Université Libre de Bruxelles,,,,,,,,Université Libre de Bruxelles,,Laura Jacobs,,,,,,,,Laura Jacobs,,Media,Political Parties,Populism,Social Media,Agenda-Setting,Communication,,,"“What is your issue?!” The role of emotional appeals, issue ownership and populism in political communication on social media",https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=63554&EventID=185
0,"Countries around the world have pledged to transition to low-carbon energy systems, but face barriers in escaping carbon lock-in. National political economy plays a key role here, especially in contexts where governments have high financial stakes in fossil-intensive energy systems. In some states where the clean energy industry is gaining ground, authors have suggested that new political coalitions can emerge and push for decarbonization. In Jordan, a significant renewable energy industry born out of a set of policies to increase energy security has become active in pushing for policy change. Their interests are opposed by the state and state-owned distribution companies, who argue that the Jordanian energy system cannot integrate more clean energy. This paper outlines the political economy of Jordanian renewable energy, exploring potential pathways for energy systems change based on a series of stakeholder interviews and qualitative scenarios. It finds that there is no silver bullet; but that a combination of regional cooperation and shifts in decision-making structures could accelerate decarbonization.",Institute for Advanced Sustainability Studies (IASS),,,,,,,,Institute for Advanced Sustainability Studies (IASS),,Silvia Weko,,,,,,,,Silvia Weko,,Green Politics,Political Economy,Climate Change,Energy,Energy Policy,,,,“You can’t out-compete the sun”: how the political economy shapes the Jordanian energy transition,https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=64966&EventID=185
0,"Youth organisations have important recruitment and socialisation functions for political parties. This is also true for populist radical right (PRR) parties: Many of them have built well-developed youth sections, where future party leaders are educated and transnational contacts may be developed. Despite their importance, PRR youth wings are largely unexplored. To tackle this research gap, this article explores the crucial case of the “Young Alternative” (JA) – a youth organisation that still seems to be the “unwanted child” of the “Alternative for Germany” (AfD). It presents an in-depth examination of the JA’s development and relationship with AfD. The paper is based on (1) semi-structured interviews with leading JA members and (2) online communication, media articles and JA official material. The contribution of the case study will be twofold: Theoretically, it will bridge the literature on party organisation, youth participation and far-right politics.
